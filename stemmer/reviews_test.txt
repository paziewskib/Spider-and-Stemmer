The cheapest one on the market anywhere.                
I'll probably go through everal of these over the next 5 years simply becvaus I'm that rugh n epuiment. But I'll always come back to Behringer because their eq's are second to none. love that German engineering!                
I'll repeat what other Behringer users already know. Behringer makes quality "tributes" of well known effects pedals and offers them at reasonable prices. The EQ700 is comparable to equalizers costing several times as much. It makes my amps and guitars sound great, offers infinite tonal ranges, is quiet (no unexpected hiss), and reliable. The case is ABS plastic, but so is your car bumper - the case does not easily crack or chip and will look good long after metal cases have deteriorated. I gig with Behringer pedals with no issues. Get a power adapter (they quickly consume batteries) and you're good to go.                
handles all my standard efx pedals even my volume pedal. The price is right. I had the canvas/material efx pedal bags but they did not protect my pedals. So, the hard shell is the perfect fix. Came with power and connections cables.                
7 band EQ settings really allow u to customize your tone.  9v Battery is nice.                
Pretty good.                
Cheapest EQ pedal there is.                
Doesn't look that amazing, but I still want it.                
Great pedal.  I like the tone it can make when I play slap bass.  I raise the Low's and High's and keep the mid's where they are.  This really lets you hear the plucks and slaps!                
it could just be my recording progam, or maybe my audio interface, but i experienced- not the most, but not the least- a bit of ugly feedback. made my peavey mystic sound like a gibson digital though.                
as of its cost versus how up to par it is with other pedals of the same features, it greatly nerfs them. there's still that slight ugly feedback though.                
simple yet versatile. perfect in a way.                
as opposed to cost, like i said, its one of the best on the market.                
definitely a deal.                
i haven't needed to talk to them. eh.                
it just looks standard, almost protocol.                
i'll be sure to keep it for quite sometime. great on a budget!                
Clean, undistorted sound. Each of the sliders has an easily audible effect, as it should. In comparison on a Daphon EQ pedal I have the sliders have only a small effect and to have an audible effect I have to slide them all the way.                
I like to be able to use an EQ on bass guitar too, where I attenuate 100 Hz and boost 200 Hz and 400 Hz sliders, then attenuate higher sliders. You can't do that with this equalizer. On the other hand I like to attenuate at about 6 kHz and above while not attenuating below about 4 kHz and this EQ allows this.  The materials and parts are poor quality, mine broke in transit to the first gig I took it to, and I did not handle it roughly. 
So, lack of durability was a big problem for me. I opened up the nonfunctioning unit but could not find any loose wires or broken connections, every thing looked right.                
The sliders slide too easily. With minor jostling I end up with tones I did not expect or want. The battery compartment is ridiculously difficult to access. It is hidden in the rocking part of the pedal.                
It broke and I couldn't fix it. It fails the gig test. It's fragile. The too-easily-slid sliders also make it unworthy for gigs.                
If you need an EQ you will not transport, fine. If you will gig with it you need to get something more durable.                
I didn't deal with the company.                
It's so plastic I always thought it was a marvel to work so well. But no, I give it no sex appeal, status, aesthetics, or affection. Now that it broke it's like an ex-wife.                
I bought a Daphon EQ. The price is about the same, it's metal and doesn't feel fragile, and the sliders aren't too slidy, but the sliders have a much much smaller effect.                
I bought two of these, and they both have the same problemsThey cause the high end to get a dissonant ringy wobble, they cut signal quality while on and this causes a major loss in sustain.I bought this knowing the quality on the outside was on extreme budget side. But they are unusable to me, so I will return them and buy something higher quality.                
This is basically a good-sounding unit.  I have my complaints about it, but they are tolerable.  One is that this thing can be very noisey.  ...But it can also be whisper quiet.  I'm not 100% on why, but I moved this pedal from my main board to my auxiliary board, and it has be nearly silent.  Other complaint is that some of the eq positions are not as useable.  The bass switch, for example, seems to cause a lot of noise when boosted.  You have to leave it under midway, or the hiss will floor you.  The boost slider, as well, needs to be within certain parameters to avoid hiss.  Also, you really have to play with this to get it to sound good.  For example, you can't just decide "I want a midrange boost," set the thing to a frown, and expect to get what you want.  I will sound quite bad, you will end up playing with switches randomly to get a good sound.  My midrange boost only sounds good with bass furthest down, a hump in the mid, and a boost to treble.  It works though.  Great midrange boost sound, but you have to fiddle a lot to get there.                
This has all the features I could ask for.                
Because of having to fiddle with setting to get what you want and to eliminate noise, I give this a 7 for ease of use.  You will have to fight this pedal a little bit to get what you want.  It will yield it to you if you are careful and not overly picky.                
Behringer quality, plastic parts, crappy batttery location, rubber that can peel off.  Just not pro stuff, but still very serviceable.                
Behringer value.  That is to say you are always going to get more than your money's worth with this pedal.                
Didn't Use.                
Behringer desireability.  It's utilitarian.  You buy it for how it work and how it sounds.  It does not look cool or impress anyone.                
This is a great unit.  I'd like to give it a 9, but I just struggled too much with noise and controls that are a little obtuse.  This thing does not suck tone though, and it will let you have a very nice eq boost on your board.  I love using it for quite pickups when I change the selector.  I like to use it as a boost for a loud rythm passage.  I like to use it as a mid-range hump boost period.  It's excellent for that.                
The first thing any guitarist should get after their first guitar and first amplifier is their first equalizer pedal (put it right after the guitar in your signal chain).. Even a novice will be able to shape beginner equipment into clear, well-defined, and possibly even legendary sounds with a few minutes of tweaking. You'll end up leaving this pedal on all the time. Even if you think you don't need the tone-shaping abilities, this is probably still the cheapest boost pedal around.Don't let the price fool you, this will do pretty much the exact same job as pedals going for four times as much. Behringer may be affordable, but they're not cheap in my experience.Unlike most pedals, it's important to note that there is no room for batteries - you must have a 9V power source to use this pedal. (Or I'm extremely oblivious, I took this fella's shell apart to see what makes it tick.) I do want to note that my particular pedal has a low-volume hiss, which I've found very noticeable on high gain settings and the high sweep on my wah pedal - although I also have unresolved grounding issues in my apartment that may be exacerbating this. The slider knobs also feel a bit fragile and pop off relatively easily, but you can still move the sliders without them. Not a big deal on either count.Bottom line, get an equalizer pedal - this is the most affordable option by far, and it'll get the job done satisfactorily. In fact, get two or three to throw in your signal chain, especially if you use other effects, it's really nice to be able to shape pre- and post- distortion among other things.                
THIS UNIT IS VERY NOISEY AND VERY CHEAP!!! THE EQ SLIDERS ETC REALLY DO NOT DO MUCH EQUING, IF YOU ARE NEED A EQ PDEAL LIKE THE OLD SAYING GOES YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR THIS THING IS TOTAL JUNK!!! NOISEY JUNK.                
I had to knock this one down.  This is the noisiest hissiest pedal I have ever owned.  I can't believe I am not seeing anyone else have that problem.  I might have bought a lemon.  The eq is fine.  You can make a decent mid scoop on this with a stomp and/or use the db to boost or attenuate your signal.  Great if you are footswitching from a clean to a metal tone.                
This has pretty much everything an eq should.                
Cakewalk.                
This is plastic and rubber, but it is durable plastic and rubber.  It will not break, but isn't quite a metal pedal either.  The switches/sliders are very cheap but are completely manageable.  Overall, this pedal is extremely useable and functional.                
Okay, you cannot buy a cheaper pedal than this.  The fact that everything works like it is supposed to and doesn't break make it an unbeatable value.                
Don't know.                
Not a desireable pedal by any means.  It's purely utilitarian.  If you want it, you want it because it is a serviceable eq and for no other reason.                
I'm am happy with my pedal purchase.  It does everything I expect it to except that it has an unbearable hiss.  I might have gotten a lemon, but instead of buying another eq, I am buying an NR to eliminate hiss.  I would recommend this pedal to anyone who needs an eq but wants to save a dime.  The only reason to climb the price ladder would be for a sturdier metal pedal, switches/sliders that feel smoother and heavier and well built, and less hiss and noise.  I can't guarantee that a Boss eq would solve all that, but if those things are important to you, it might be better to start there.                
The sound is great, I loop it through my amp, gives me the sound I'm looking for.                
Standard features for EQ                
Very easy to use                
Made out of plastic, but it seems sturdy.                 
It was cheap and it works great.                
Asked their tech support a question about power adapter, they got back to me within a day.                
Great EQ and the price is right. N                
This easily compares to the Boss EQ, or other common names in terms of sound. You could a/b them and be hard pressed to find much of a difference besides the obvious visual aspect.                
Despite the plastic casing, I havent had any problems with this unit so far. The plastic casing doesnt sound very promising to say the least, but It would be fairly tough to really destroy it. The bottom is a metal siding with thick rubber to keep it in place, but the rest is a plastic case. It is thick, so unless you drop gear often or put them to the test of the road, it should hold up.                
For this low price, I don't see how it could be a bad deal in any way. Unless you recieved a broken pedal, I wouldnt be complaining, especially with the sound quality of this pedal.                
To sum things up, for the price it is unbeatable. Just as good as a Boss eq, but in a yellow plastic disguise.                
Hi, I received my long awaited back-order yesterday (two F1220D's) with great anticipation. First noticed these speakers are much smaller than expected. (About half the size of a "regular" stage monitor.) Open the box, hooked-em up and played with them for awhile.   They have some great features that I like. (Bi-amp, dual input with separate level controls) They hit "clip" fairly easily but have a pretty decent sound overall, But then I decided to hook up one of my Behringer F-1320's inline next to these. The one F-1320 dwarfed two of these in size and sound. Just drowned them completely out. So if you need BIG sound these F1220D's are probably NOT for you.                 
I bought a few of these for band monitors for our singers.  I especially liked the feedback filter feature due to all the problems we usually have because of it.  In an effort to simplify the process i got these.  They seem to be well made, and as a previous owner of ev powered speakers I can honestly say that the name brand doesn't necessarily mean anything.  Behringer is truly a big bang for the buck and I recommend their speakers to anyone that dj's or does band gigs....and likes their money more than a high price name brand.  Well with about the same results and in most cases BETTER....you cant go wrong.  The only thing that I didn't really care for about these particular speakers is that they don't seem to like bass at all.....so if your looking for solid vocal or keyboard monitor this is for you. As it stands, it suits our needs. You cant use this as a drum monitor in other words.  As a future further improvement it would be eventually nice to see a built in two line mini mixer to adjust instrument sounds on a separate channel as the vocal....this of course is easily fixed by buying one of the little Behringer line mixers for about 20 bucks....so not really an issue.  I will write another review once these have been tested in real time.  We have used these for practices and they perform as expected.                
You'll have a wide range of sound parameters including the Anti-Feed Back option as a stand alone system. You can jump/patch the Monitors together. The power of the F1320D is enough to deafen you.                
Rugged construction. All mixer setting knobs are recessed for protection. Metal front screen in a convex form will protect the 12" speaker from damage. Exterior covering and corner protectors are well made. Anti-Feed Back is effective.                
Plug&Play as normal equipment. They are no disappointments just options.All connectors are top quality.                
 All connectors are good quality except for the AC switch. The AC switch is plastic and is not recessed like the mixer knobs on the front panel. That is the ONLY thing I would recommend improving. Like other reviewers, who commented on the F1320D lacking low end, I agree however this is a floor monitor. Keep that in mind.                
Behringer designers and engineers have produced very high quality products at a reasonable price. I feel I made the right choice, in the price range I needed. I don't have a grand to drop on a sub-woofer for example. I need the sound, not the Name Plate. It was gratifying to discover Behringer and become a very happy customer.                
No comments. Haven't had the need yet. (That's a plus.) This is a professional company. I feel confident that any manufacturer who makes top quality products like this will back them up with service.                 
WOW factor for me is very high.                
You can not find a better value for your money that Behringer products. This monitor is rugged and has all the features you want for a floor monitor. You will be very satisfied you selected a Behringer product, and like me, you'll want to purchase more Behinger products.                
For the price , this Monitor has a lot to offer, Plenty of power, Clean Crisp Highs, Tight punchy lows and smooth warm Mids, The 3 band EQ gives you all of this. Controls are easy to get to. Unless you have a sound person on stage, they can't hear what you need. This really works well as far as volume, clarity and feedback control                
I bought one of these these to try. Wasn't expecting it to be all that great. Used it at our  gig the next weekend and was very impressed. Ordered another one Monday morning.                 
The band had about had its fill of repairing monitor amps that didn't hold up, so I purchased a couple of these Behringer F1320Ds.  The sound is full and amazing!  I already knew that Behringer equipment was better than many thought, but we are really impressed with the sound of these.  Our vocals are tighter now, because we can actually hear ourselves!  We tested them in practice by using them as our PA (instead of using the mains) and they really were impressive.                
I purchased this monitor so that the led singer in our band could hear herself over the loud percussion section. It really did the job for the money. One of my best purchases. I highly recommend it.                
Rugged construction, great sound.  It took a little bit of tweaking to suppress feedback (there's a button for it) while using condenser microphones, but this'll be a great asset going forward.                
Simple, rugged, powerful. Amazing. I use 2 for band monitors. No feedback anymore. Loud! 300 watts x2 is a lot. Great response in each frequency.                
Product is top quality! Service A1 as always. Item arrives well packed and in excellent shape as always! You can't go wrong with this company or their products!                
What a AWSOME machine. Added to my studio rack and it cuts out the low noise in the background. You get a great recording with this machine.                
Iv tried other EQs and this is the best Recording/Mixing /DJ/Live/Studio/Home Or Club.THE FBQ is the Difference Maker along with Separate Bass control for your SUBs and HD ..And the price is Right.                
The unit does what is claims to do... eliminate feedback and allow the audio to be virtually untouched or colored in any way.  I am very pleased with the unit once set up.                 
Why a rating of only 5?  Because the newer unit OS ver 1.1 purchased in May 2009 does not set up per the operating manual (operating manual ver1.0 written in 2005).  I own two of these units, the older unit OS ver1.0 purchased in 2006 sets up as advertised but this unit DOES NOT!  You MUST initially put the unit in PEQ mode (parametric eq) and use the fly set up control wheel and set the mumber of parametric filters to some value (I chose zero) and then you can set the number of single shot filters and the balance of the remaining filters will function automatically.  THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED SOMEWHERE!!!  After you do this initially it does not need to be repeated because the unit recalls all of the previous settings once the unit is powered down and it works GREAT!  
No problems here, the older unit has worked flawlessly for me now for 3 1/2 years.  We play gigs 2-4 per month, we are pleased with how well the unit has performed once in operation.                  
Nobody can tough Behringer for price+performance.                 
I have had one experience with the Behringer company and they were very helpful.  
Zzounds has been wonderful to deal with as I have exchanged products with them and they have been very professional with me.                
Well built and performs as advertised... but Behringer needs a new technical writer on staff                
I have this unit connected to all of our vocal mics routed thru a sub-group and it is noiseless.  Even when running all 20 filters on a channel the overall impact it has on the sound is negligible.                
The FBQ elimination features are nice and easy to manage.  The use of this unit as a parametric EQ is just plain silly, however, due to reasons listed in "ease of use" below.  Learn mode and autolearn mode are horrendously hard on your speakers because they have to really be ringing for the system to tag it as feedback and suppress it.  I had to wear earplugs the first time I let the system learn by itself as it was screaming before suppression kicked in.  The use of the panic button in learn mode does prevent this from  happening.  Recommended procedure for shooting a room is listed below.                
As a feedback eliminator, this unit is easy to use.  The manual is dense, but easy to understand IF you study it for a few days while the product is in the mail.  The manual is rather deceptive in that it makes you think the unit will automatically nuke feedback within 0.2 seconds.  Wrong.  It takes much longer to learn or autolearn feedback frequencies and will blow out your eardrums or your speakers first.  Here's what I have found works best: Setting the system to learn mode and then slowly increasing the gain on the entire system to deliberately induce feedback while pressing the panic button repeatedly.  This helps the system detect feedback more quickly and will save your ears and your speakers.  Once all 20 filters are full, back the gain off and you now have instant headroom.  Now as a parametric EQ, navigation is so clumsy and difficult you'd be better just spending $100 on a 15-band standalone eq.                
The product looks nice.  The brushed aluminum is gorgeous.  I gave it a 9 and not a 10 because the knob on the front isn't perfectly round and feels and looks cheap when it's wobbling around as you turn it.  Other than that, it is well made.                
Feedback suppression for $150........you can't really go wrong here.  Once you've figured the darn thing out it really does it's job well.  I was able to DOUBLE the volume of our practices in a small room with this unit because of the feedback frequencies it was supressing.                
Can't rate this one; haven't needed support.                
It has gain LED's and lots of red lights.....looks cool in the rack.  I've seen sexier feedback eliminators, but for $150, this is as hot as she's gunna get.  ;-)                
This product does what it's supposed to do and does it well, after you've figured out how to use it without blowing your ears or speakers.  As I said before, autodetect functions are quite slow, but using the panic button to help her along greatly reduces the sound level required to trip a filter.                
No noise from the unit, and it does a great job of suppressing feedback.  Too difficult to use as a parametric EQ, don't waste your time.                
Easy to set up for Feedback suppression, and that is what I bought it for.  I have used it for over a year in my band's monitor amp & EQ rack.  We run four separate monitor mixes and I have used it to suppress feedback on two of those channels. Other channels feedback is regulated by a much more expensive Sabine filter and it does the same job at less than 25% the cost!  Way to go Behringer.                 
I have had no problems with the unit.  I did have the cheaper Behringer older unit ad I had "clock hash" noise always at a low level coming through and it was much slower and harder to use.  This unit has worked very well.                 
Great value.                
no experience                
Looks like a piece of rack mount audio gear, nothing special.                
This unit meets my band's needs and I don't plan on replacing it.                
I can't detect any noise from the unit.                
I use this as a parametric equalizer in manual mode.  Even though another review said this didn't make much sense it does to me.  The key is that this will do 1/60th octave filters.  This is amazing and is very usefull for room peaks for low frequency (sub-woofer) improvement.  Room treatments don't work very well at these frequencies and this product is the best solution.                
Setting up the filters manually isn't a big deal once you do it once.  Also, there is software avialable that will do it via MIDI download.                
I wish the side panels extended under the rack mounts wings.  You can't remove the wings or else the sides are open.  Overall, the build looks good.                
Very high value. I haven't found anything else that will do this for this kind of price.                
There documentation is OK but they could explain things a bit better about setting filters.                
The lights look cool until you want them off. :-)  I use this in a home theater setting and cover up the red LEDs because they are too bright.  For a rack look it would be sexy.                
I have not found any other product close to this value.  There are systems that can do filtering like this but at many times the cost.                
Great, fantastic. This Feedback Destroyer Pro actually does eliminate 99.9 % of the feedback. It is built like a super heavy duty quality tank. It works for me. Thanks...........                
I play in a damp club (basement type) and often the sliders and pots build up garbage which makes them noisy and scratchy. This happens on all my equipment. From Rane to Panasonic, all do the same. I expected Behringer to be the worse and to my surprise, my Behringer equipment is not experiencing this problem. Go figure...  Good stuff. As for sound quality, no different than my really expensive stuff.                
Just like any other expensive equipment. Good bang for the buck.                
If you cant use this, you cant use any other equipment of this type.                
Best in "bang for the buck" category.                
Best value.                
Dont need support, just throw it out and buy another at that price.                
bottom line is the equalizer works, its great for ringing out monitors on stage or inside the rehearsal room, BUT, I noticed a slight reduction in overall volume even when the EQ is bypassed, and when engaged it clearly reduces the volume compared to directly from the source, that's why I would only use it for monitors and not for the front of the house, the last thing you want is for the entire mix to drop in volume, with monitors it won't be that big of a deal as you can always increase the volume on the monitors themselves, other than that its a great unit that won't cost you much if you are trying to get the best experience with your rehearsal monitors or stage monitors, cuts the feedback very well and has a feedback detection feature (although I just use my ears)                
I bought this with several different uses, and I have come up with more since getting it. In live sound, I can use it as an EQ for a guitar. Also, I can run the main signals through my regular 31-band EQ, then into this, for two reasons: 1) I don't have the ear to know the feedback frequencies; I can pull down the FBQ800 band that is lit up, then figure out which band on the 31-band to pull down. 2) I use the 31-band for feedback; I can use the FBQ800 to shape the overall sound for the room.  I want to cut the feedback with as little impact on the music as possible. Also, this has allowed me to run in stereo (with a 2nd FBQ800), so I don't necessarily have to cut both sides to solve feedback.
Since I got this, though, I use it on one input of my TV (the main input, or the DVD player), and I can do a much better job with the sound than just the 2-band (bass/treble) TV EQ.  I can definitely notice the difference.  I want to get two more of these just for the TV.                
What is great are the FBQ lights, which show which band is getting feedback, or which band is getting the activity.  The thing is $60, though, so it has none of the frills of a serious EQ. Also, having both 1/4-inch and RCA inputs is a big deal.                
If you know how to use a graphic EQ, it's simple.                
It is made of plastic, and has a cheap feel.  I don't care, as long as I don't step on it.  I don't know what would happen if I dropped it on a hard floor.                
Very definitely worth the price.  I would like to buy 5-6 more.                
I have a number of Behringer products, and I have never had to deal with the company.  Not that I think I won't, some day...                
The Behringer FBQ800 is a really great piece of gear. I use it for small live sound applications with a pair of powered Mackie Thump 12 speakers and a Peavey PV8 mixer. It works exactly as advertised. If there is feedback, the appropriate slider lights up and stays RED and you slowly pull that level down until the feedback stops. It's pretty solid, but it  isn't built like a tank, so it can't be tossed around and abused. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.                
This is the best interface for Windows and Mac users, both USB and Firewire ports are working flawlessly. There are no problems with the drivers and the latency is zero! Great for recording a drum set or a live band. So far so good, gorgeous aluminium casing. 
And for the price it's like having it almost for free!                
So I just purchased one of the FCA1616 as a backup while my primary interface is out for repair, also figured being both USB and firewire would be a nice choice to have. 
I must say the main features for purchasing it are extremely disappointing. 
First being the adat expansion is completely non existent in terms of direct input monitoring. 
Meaning you must always monitor through your choice of DAW in order to hear your additional 8 channels over adat. 
Second being the headphone volume knobs are completely dependent on your main level output. (come on behringer, even the cheapest presonus 2 channel unit has dedicated volume level control on the headphone and the main volume output). The 2nd headphone jack can be switched to monitor your DAW line 3/4 output, which is pretty nice if doing a headphone buss mix, yet is pointless being that direct monitoring only happens over the 1/2 outputs only. 
Third, there's no actual level input meter. The green signal level turns "clip red" way before the DAW input monitoring shows actual clip. 
Fourth, and here's the worst part of all. The firewire option is completely useless. Since this is buss powered over firewire itself it constantly picks up the "digital distortion signal" from the computer's power supply since a power conditioner can not be used on a buss powered unit, power adapter plugged in does not override the buss powered feature. I wish there was an option to have it be dedicated to power only via the power adapter instead of firewire buss like all other 8+ channel firewire interfaces. 
Having to resort to USB2.0 on my primary studio computer is a huge turn off. 
The usb was a nice option for mobile tracking only on a no firewire laptop. 
Another huge disappointment is there is no software mix control, I understand this was built through DAW monitoring, yet why even tease the public with the option at all on the front panel if you're not going to make full potential of it?  
Only features I do like are the individually select-able features for each channel. 
Hi-z select swith, 48v, highpass filter, and pad.  
Once my main unit is back from repair, this is going back to the store, and keeping searching for another back up option. Such a shame since I was hopping it to be at least suitable for mobile tracking.                 
For the price, it's pretty good.  There is a little bit of hiss that I hear.  There are a couple things I would suggest.  I  would like them to have independent headphone, monitor and main output volume controls.  In order to hear the headphones loud enough, you need to turn the main volume up.  If you turn the main volume down, then the headphone volume goes down.  Make it easier to switch from Firewire to USB.  Also, needs to be a better manual. Also, having trouble with the midi.  This is the first Behringer product I've ever had any trouble with, so I might just have a faulty unit.                 
Based on my very first impressions, this is a fantastic unit for the price. I am returning it immediately, however, due to one incredibly short-sighted design flaw: The headphone outputs are wired post-main output knob, so the main output knob needs to be turned up in order for the headphones to get signal. For those of you with small project studios (Behringer's target market), that means you don't have independent control of your monitor speakers and headphones - such as when you want to turn speakers down to record vocals while keeping the headphones up. You can get independent controls by doubling your DAW's output to FCA1616 outputs 3-4 (extra time/hassle/potential latency) or by using an external monitor controller (extra $/gear/wiring). I really thought this unit would be perfect, but it's so slightly yet importantly not.                
Doesn't make any sound...                
I think the features in this unit are pretty nice.  There are 100 presets, and each preset can control multiple MIDI devices.  For example, with the push of one pedal you could send 5 different program change signals to 5 different MIDI instruments, 2 different control signals to two MIDI instruments, and set the two expression pedals to send MIDI control values 0-127 for two different controls on two different MIDI instruments.
Every once in a while I wonder why Behringer didn't give you the ability to send more than 2 controller signals instead of 5 program change signals with each preset - however it's really not limiting me yet.                
IN RESPONSE TO OTHER REVIEWS THAT CLAIM THE EXPRESSION PEDALS DON'T WORK:
Out of the box, my expression pedals didn't seem to work.  I calibrated the unit and they now work fine.  Just do a search on the web for the words "behringer", "footpedal", and "calibrate", or something like that - the calibration directions are all over the web.
Other than that, the quality seems pretty solid.  The expression pedals feel a tiny bit flimsy, but I haven't had any problems with them.                
For all the functionality you get in this product I think it's absolutely a good buy if you have multiple MIDI instruments that you'd like to use it with.  I think it might be a bit overkill if you're only using it with one - however there's nothing else out there that seems better, so it's a good buy for that too.
Understand that you should probably have an intermediate understanding of MIDI to get the most out of this and you'll have to spend a little time learning how to use it.                
Haven't had to use it yet.  All my questions have been answered by searching the web.                
i dunno - it's not particularly ugly, so....                
I'll probably have this for a long, long time.  Having two assignable expression pedals is great.                
Doesn't generate sound. Foot switch controller for Midi devices. In this case, used with a Johnson J-Station                
Features are that it is programmable for just about any MIDI device. Operators manual was pretty much useless. Very Poorly written.                
Seemes relatively strong. Metal case. Foot switches encased in rubber. I have had it over 18 months and use it weekly. I don't move it around too often. No case with it so I had to purchase a Fender Instrument Midi controller case.                
After corresponding with others that have tried other controllers, this one seems to have the consensus as best value for the money. Others may have a built in Tuner function, but this one is less expensive.  Most bang for the Bucks.                
I had to email Behringer's USA office to get the new software chips. Have had no other issues so no further contact with Tech Support.                
Nothing "Magnetically appealing" about it. Just functional.  Nothing to make one LUST after it.                 
Doubt if it will wear out. I doubt if I have the need to upgrade. Yes, it does help me meet my musical needs.
If it were lost or stolen, yes, I would buy it again.
I like it because it works. Once I learned how easy it was to program it, I liked it more. 
Again, the Operators manual, well,  sucked big time.  Completely useless.                
N/A - MIDI                
Lots of features for the money.  Despite the claims of other reviewers, the expression pedals on my unit work fine.  I had to calibrate them the first time I used it and haven't had any problems since.  Anybody whose having trouble with the pedals, read the manual and recalibrate them.
My main complaint is that you can assign 5 program changes, but only 2 sysex sends (CC or Control Change messages) per pedal.  I believe this is because the pedal is mainly designed to be used with guitar and bass amps that use MIDI to control effect settings.  I use it as a MIDI controller for software on my computer and have far more use for CC messages than program change messages (CC messages are what you use for midi control of knobs, sliders and buttons on your music software).  I suppose part of the blame goes to the software I'm using, as it won't allow one CC number to control multiple settings.                
Rugged, heavy.  I spilled beer on it, and it still works fine.                
Lots of features for the money.  I bought B-Stock, so it was even cheaper.                
Haven't needed to contact Behringer yet, which is a big plus.  Their manual, on the other hand, is one of the worst I've seen.  Behringer's Web site isn't great either.                
You get a lot of features for the money, which is why I bought it.  On the other hand, programming it is more complicated than it should be and the documentation is horrible.  A good buy if you're good at figuring things out on your own.                
This is a Midi foot controller so the sound really doesn't apply                
I own 2 of these controllers and use them for both my Fender CyberTwin and Cyber Deluxe.  They're programable if I have other midi type equipment that I want to use them on.                
There's a learning curve on just about everything that's out there today but, I was able to use this right out of the box without having to make any adjustments.  If I did want to access more capabilities I'd just have to program it and I'm there.                
I like this controller over my OEM Fender.  It's half the weight and half the price.                
It's half the price of OEM Fender controllers and they'll do the same job.                
Haven't had to deal with the company on this or any other Behringer equipment I've ever bought.                
It's practical and affordable.  Nothing special about the looks but the colors blend in with about everything else on stage.  Nothing stands out about it but, being it's a floor controller, I wouldn't want anything that really flashy.  It looks and works perfect for its application.                
As a main goal, it's to save money whenever possible.  This piece of equipment does everything I would expect of it and probably more if I needed it to.  No need to look for anything to replace it and it's flexible enough to use on other midi equipment if needed.  I'll have it as long as I have a need for it and at this time I don't see any reason for an upgrade, change, or replacement.                
Lots of pedals and two expression pedlas.  Thats plenty.                
I know first hand that it is a bear to figure out for most uses.  However, if you use it with the Behringer Vampire series of guitar effects and amps or with the Behringer V-Tone amps it is super easy to use.  It gives you so much more versitility with these amps.                
Built like a tank.                
Its inexpensive for what you get.                
Never need them.                
I now need this for use with my Behringer amps.  Without it would be tough.                
It works great and is reliable as can be.  What more do you need?                
would help if I could understand it better!                
Miriad of setup possibilities                
Manual is poor in terms of going through the set ups - not easy for a MIDI newbie                
Rugged and self contained                
The product is awesome. It is difficult to program but worth it. I use it with my V-amp pro works great.                
Easy to use once its programed to do what you want.                 
Very difficult to program. Found a guide for dummies on it and it made it a little easier to program.                
reasonably priced.                 
have not needed to .                
I own it.                
If it wasn't so hard to program I would give it a better score.                
lots of features, I can't imagine anything you could want to do with this thing that it can't *theoretically* be programmed to do                
Decent craftsmanship/solid as per usual with behringer products                
Decent value, again what you would expect from behringer                
not used for my sound just to control my behringer vamp pro                
support is not bad but i am having trouble finding an upgraded eprom chip 4 it                
 I LIKE THE FCB1010 DEFINATE PICE OF MY STAGE ARSONAL                
if i could find the eprom chips for it it could keep me 4 ever                
I bought this controller for my Avid Eleven Rack, and it is a huge disappointment. Instructions were minimal, even the manual that you have to download off the net. I tried contacting Behringer 3 times, and received no response. So back to my pedal board> Now I only use my eleven rack in a studio environment. I will never buy a Behreinger product again                
it doesn't make sound                
Flexible programming and easy to program. Good manual.
BUT
I have owned four over the last 5 years and all of them have had a switch or pedal break. While it looks and feels sturdy it is not. I treat all my instruments/tools with a lot of care and the units broke because they are not well made NOT because of abuse. I've had a Yamaha MFC10 foot controller on the road at the same time and never had any problems.                
Interface is nice. Flexible programming and easy to program. Good manual. Too bad they fall apart :-(                
No. I have owned four FCB1010's over the last 5 years and all of them have had a switch or pedal break. While it looks and feels sturdy it is not. I treat all my instruments/tools with a lot of care and the units broke because they are not well made NOT because of abuse. I've had a Yamaha MFC10 foot controller on the road at the same time and never had any problems.                
I'm MORE then happy to pay two or three times as much for another company's foot controller that is sturdy and reliable.
The FCB1010 may be inexpensive but it sure is unreliable.
You get what you pay for and the FCB1010 is proof.                
Difficult to contact and not at all helpful.                
doesn't matter how sexy it is if it breaks                
I will never buy another FCB1010 again. My living depends on reliable instruments.                
N/A                
Great features - I wish I wish I wish they would work because the only thing like them is an ART and they aren't too good at making things work either                
The expression pedals on three units failed to work. This is not good quality                
I want one so bad but i need them to work and the expression pedals do not                
No answer on e-mail
promised to call back - still waiting                
it has great features. I want it so bad I am about to reengineer it myself to get the expression pedals to work                
I think I have been clear. I won't go into the testing details but suffice it to say: In the programming mode you are supposed to be able to use expression pedal A to set parameter values. It won't even do that. I tried three units right out of the box                
Plenty of configuration available.  Maybe too much.                
Really difficult and time consuming to configure.  With any luck though, you'll only need to configure it once.                
The main pedals are sturdy, rugged and quick to respond.  The expression pedals are not so hot though.  They have a really small response range.  I'm tempted to replace the potentiometers and see if that'll give a more expressive transition from loud to soft.                
Great bang for your buck as pedals go.  Really low price but still gets the job done of most pedal boards.                
Meh... looks okay.  Nothing spectacular.                
this product sucks. it does not do half of what it promises. The pedals are absolutely worthless and when i called for support all i got was being put on hold!                
This product is a MIDI foot switch that controls other musical devices such as keyboards, sound modules, etc.  Therefore, it produces no sound.                
This product has no accessories.  All you need is a MIDI cable to connect this product to any other device that you would like to control.  And with a deep programming capabilities of this product, you would be able to produce a diverse range of features.                 
There is certainly a learning curve.  If you have some basic MIDI knowledge and you are willing to read the manual, you will have a very very very powerful MIDI footswitch.                
zZounds did a good job by having double boxed this product prior to shipping.  This double boxing method has kept the factory box look brand-new & pristine.  The product is very solid and well-built.  No loose parts & no blemishes.  The product looks elegant & expensive.  It also looks strong & sturdy for use "on the road".                
Given the diverse range of functions that this product is capable of, this product is much cheaper than other MIDI footswitches made by other companies.                
Because I have no issue with the product, I have no need to contact the company that made this product.                
As stated earlier, this product looks very elegant & expensive                
If this product were lost or stolen, I definitely would replace it.                  
a bit hard to program but i feed it into software so it's not a problem. it's got all the pedals i need!                
never had any trouble with it and i've used it for 3 years. I loan it out periodically to other musicians and i never worry it will be damaged. I'm only giving it an 8 because a good drop, or spilling liquid on it, would probably do it in.                
I'm giving it a 6 because I wish it was around $100. However I haven't seen any other pedals with a continuous-controller pedal built in and that's what I really want.                
idk. never had any trouble so i've never needed to call support!                
People ask me what it is all the time. Gigs, carrying it around, they see it and they want it.                
I don't know anything that compares to this feature set but I feel it could be better (i.e. I'm not giving it a 10). I own it and like (might buy another to keep in my home studio).                
The product does work as a keyboard volume pedal, however there is definitely a hum associated with it.  While playing it is not noticable, but is when no one is playing.                
There are very few features.  It has a knob that lets you set the max volume and you can control the volume for 2 instruments or left and right simulatanously.  It runs on 9V battery or 12V AC adapter - here is where the problem lays.  I can't find a 12V AC adapter that works.  Radio Shack no longer carries a multi-tap adapter.  You have to buy the adapter that fits it and they tried them all and said none of their's works.  Which is amazing considering that they have almost 50 different sizes at least.                
It is easy to use except when you have to change the 9V battery.  If you don't unplug the pedal after each use, your battery will be dead.  I wish Behringer sold a 12V AC adapter, but they only make a 9V one.                
Would pay more if it included the 12V AC Adapter.                
Haven't had to use yet.                
It's a volume pedal.                
I use this Unit in between my Mixer and ART PRO VLA II  and its a Great Unit for the Price. Most of my equipment must do double duty  right now at home in the Studio as well as out on the road in live venues. While I havn't  had  the chance to use this at a live venue as of yet I really can't wait to try it out the diffrence it made in my recordings was astounding.                
as with  most Behringer products it has almost too many features. I have  not had a chance to use every single one but each effect I have used is editable and saveable                 
I found it extremely easy to use. Read the quick Start Guide hooked it up  and that was that. I guess it might be intimidateing to some one less educated or experienced but that wasn't the case for me.                
I rate it an 8 on quality because of the cheap plastic knobs and the midi/mix knob gets really stiff about half way around (They may have designed it that way on purpose and if thats the case I wish they hadn't I would of preffered a smooth linear action)it free's back up right past the 1/2 way mark.                
I bought the blowout model at 1/2  price and I have to say this unit would of been worth the full price and then some  its worked perfectly far exeeding my expectations                
I can't Say havn't needed them as of yet.                
I don't really know how to answer this one so I rated it 6. While not just drop dead gorgeous it definatly added to the overall appeal of my Rack.                
I will keep this untill it dies for sure and even replace it. That being said I will be adding other equipment for stand alone features
 I love that it did what it said it would do and then some. I don't like the cheap plastic knobs and the midi/mix knobs sticky action                
Very easy to use. The sound quality is much better than many of the vst-plugins I've used, and build quality is really good. Only complaints I have, is that the main jogwheel is a bit too sensitive to my taste and it feels like it might brake down after some years of use, and that it could have more of different delay types.                
The sound is excellent and very customizable. I was very surprised as this unit is so cheap.                 
The Jogwheel makes it really quick and easy to skip through pre sets and effects and the midi knob makes it really quick to wet'n or dry up the effects mix and bypass the effects when needed,                 
Once you have read the manual and get use to the lay out it is really easy to use and edit. The knobs and jog wheel are very quick and responsive and make changing your settings very quick.                 
The unit is built very well. People keep complaining about the Plastic knobs and jog wheel but I like them. They have a rubber coating on them so its easy to grip and they are very responsive. It's made to be in a rack unit so as long as you have it in a decent raod case there should be nothing to worry about. The Frame is metal and display screen is a nice size.                 
In short IMO you get way more than what you pay for. A great unit for the studio or gigging.                 
Have not had to use yet.                 
Wow is all I can say.... 129.99 was not expecting this. More effects than I will ever need for my bass and can also use with my home studio. It looks very nice in your rack as well! If it was stolen or damaged I would for sure get another!                
Way more than what I expected. I bought this for my Bass rack and wasn't sure I would be able to use much of the effects for my bass but I was way wrong. All the presests are so customizable that you can make almost all of the presets sound good on any instrument. I use this on my bass rig and when at home I plop my rack down on the table and use it in my home studio on guitar, bass and vocals.                 
Love this behringer fx 2000 , people talk bad about Behringer but they make good products at a reasonable price. I never had any of my equipment to fail. This machine makes your music or live gig sound great. Thanks behringer.                
thought maybe the product would be less than expected for the price but OOOOPS,,this processor owns hands down.More than enough features to get any small or large job done..am not going to list the other items in my case just yet but i will say this FX 2000 is a great buy and addition to anyones case..thx                
The best cool effects, sounds good.                
unit works well .You want some thing special this is the one                
its a really good product just really wished could of bought on here                
This was the worst investment I've ever made.  The thing worked just one time - in practice session.  When we got to the gig, it had lost the settings, and just flat stopped having any effect at all.  It has never worked since; we pulled it out of the rack and don't even try any more.  It has soured me completely on Behringer.  Forget the sweet price, and spend a little more to get something that actually works.  These cheap pieces of garbage cost much more in the long run.                
Nothing about this piece of junk is worth mentioning...though we were able to use the power cord that came with it for other equipment that actually works.                
Programming it was a pain in the rear too.  Not user friendly or intuitive at all.                
Junk...undependable.  Cheap knobs too -- they break off very easily.                
I wouldn't pay a dime for this.                
Support? Didn't get a single call back from their automated help line.                
z - e - r - o                
Like nothing, hate everything about it including the company that pawned it off on me.                
I've read so many reviews from pedal snobs dissing Behringer, but don't go by the internet's negativity. It does what it's supposed to for 1/3 or the price. This is made of plastic, but it's sturdy solid plastic. Mine had no defects and all the functions work just fine, with no dirty noises. Effects are great sounding, with somewhat limited tweaking options.
I bought this to learn guitar effect usage at the same time as my regular guitar study, and it does make things much more alive. If new to these effects, best start with your single note exercises, for example: "Scarborough Fair" with a low repetition delay, "Jamaica Farewell" with moderate tremolo, or "Yellow Rose of Texas" with a fast chorus effect, using the neck pickup with tone dial turned down. This pedal will help you explore the endless tone combinations on your electric guitar. Combine with some backing tracks and you'll be surprised by what you hear. 
The pedal comes with very simple instructions, so just take it out of the box, add to your rig and start moving dials. I have this in the effects loop of a Fender FM212R, but you can also place it after your distortion or overdrive stomp box.
Get this, search for what popular songs use the effects provided with this pedal, and experiment.                
This pedal is decent. For the money you get some really good effects. the only downside is the pedal is made of plastic. I suggest you buy the power supply to supply it. the design of the battery placement is not that great.                
The sound is really the only reason i still use this product.                
It has alot of features but none that you cant get for a few bucks extra from Digitech.                 
The first time i get this pedal it was dead, so i sent back and got a new one that kind of worked. i had to play with the knobs to get it to work and some times it would cut out for no reason, also the first 3 knobs do not do what they describe.(ex. the Level knob does not control the output level as described in the instructions.)                
I have this pedal on my board as a "back up" type pedal, i only use it for some effects on some songs. i have to play with it before a show to make sore its working and i fear it will break or cut my guitar out at any second. this was not built at all well, though the visual appearance is not to bad the electrical quality was a waist.                
The value was all most worth it but not fully worth what i payed.                 
I have not dealt with Behringer before but most of my products from them are defective so i stopped getting Behringer products. Every time i need to return an item zzounds helps and they are amazing with help.                 
The "sex appeal" is maby a 4.                 
I would turn this product in for anything else without a second thought.                 
This thing actually sounds pretty good for what it is.  The delay, chorus, and phaser are primarily what I used it for.  They were all a bit limited, but adequate sounding for a super-cheap multi.  You'll find that if you are serious about getting a good chorus, for example, you will have to buy a dedicated chorus.  Probably not a Behringer one.  Still, the chorus that comes with this multi really does have some good settings, as do the other effects.                
This thing really does do it all for under $40.  The number of effects you get is staggering.  And the ability to adjust them is pretty good.  If you really just want to experiment with adding different effects to your sound, the features of this are great.                
The knob to select the type of effect you are using is analog, which makes it a bit of a pain to line up your effect.  The two tweaking knobs aren't always clear what they do.  Still, it is basically easy to use.  Select the effect and play with the two knobs until it sounds the way you want it.                
Quality is where the pedal truly falters.  This is the first Behringer pedal I've had really crap out on me.  Let me tell you, when it craps out, it is truly spectacular.  Even the on/off doesn't work properly.  The off position always produces a screwed up phaser sound.  The on position sometimes still works.  But lets face it, if you can't turn it off, it is worse than useless.  I would HATE to have something like this happen on stage.  Because of this, I am working on replacing all my Behringer pedals with EHX, in case I go on the road, and I need reliability.                
The value of this thing would be staggering if not for the fact that it broke.  I have had it for maybe a year, and it went kaput.  It is a great 'slot filler' for your pedal board.  If you have some extra space, and you don't know what you want to put there, this is something to buy.  It lets you experiment with chorus, flanger, phaser, delay, etc.  The key word being 'experiment.'  Once you find out what you really use a lot and want to add to your sound (in my case chorus and delay), chuck this thing and buy a really good dedicated effect.  I'm an EHX fan, but there is plenty out there better than this.                
Did not use.  I fully expected to have issues with a Behringer pedal at some point.  This thing is a throw away for me.  If it breaks (and it has), I plan on replacing it with an EHX pedal.                
Nobody things Behringer is sexy.  I was trying out for a cover band, and I think I was automatically one down to whoever else tried out just for having so much Behringer EQ.  It is highly frowned upon, and you will not be viewed as a serious player while playing this EQ.                
There is, however, and upside to this pedal.  It does work great out of the box, and if you are careful with it, it can be a good experimental slot filler on your board.  Don't let it come to any hard crashes.  Don't accidentally feed back the input into the output.  Be careful when using stereo patch cables.  Don't cross up A and B.  I'm not sure which of these things ended up breaking mine.  I have a feeling it was when I created a feedback loop in my pedal chain.  All the rest of my stuff survived it with no problem, but that was right around the time I really started having trouble with this Behringer Multi.                
the effects are crap compared to BOSS or any other high name brand                
a ton of features you have 6 different effects and adjustment knobs                
hard to get a decent sound                
poorly made!                
stopped working The FIRST time i replaced batt's                
it appealed to me because i had experience with other behringer products  and they were amazing... plus it was cheap with a lot of effects.                
considering that it broke so fast i'll give it a 4 but if it would have worked longer i would have given it a 6ish.                
Has good sound, when it makes any. I don't remember many details because it worked so briefly but I was excited initially to hear it.                
The effects themselves are nicely grouped together in one package                
Easy to use, comfortably controlled                
Broke twice from simple operation, no stomping, transporting, or abuse involved. Main concern                
Maybe if you baby it and use the stereo function it would be worth something.                
I don't know, never called Behringer directly for support but there was no repairing the item and no factory issued warranty which isn't disappointing exactly for the money. I still support Behringer                
Looks good in pics, but up close you see that it's plastic which is a turnoff if you're looking for a professional appearance.                
Have your thirty dollars ready? Now take your money, roll it up, and burn it. Congratulations, you just accomplished the equivalent of purchasing a Behringer multi-effects pedal. This item quit after the first time I used it once, I had it replaced on warranty through the seller and after three uses, the second pedal was in the same condition. The red light comes on and no sound comes out. Save yourself the money, a lot of headache, and possible gig embarrassment by NOT buying this.                
I am used to playing through a class A tube amp, but needed something for church to use my custom pedal board. I was pleasantly surprised with the sound I got from this box. Convincing tube amp sound through the PA. As a DI box, this is the best electric sound I've had playing through a PA system. Great clean sound was very easy to find.                
Not a lot of features, which is nice. Simple to get a good clean sound. I have boutique overdrive effects so I was looking for something clean. Simple tone controls. You can also get a nice overdriven sound with this but I preferred my pedals for that.                 
Very easy to use. Plug it in, dial in your sound, and go. Doesn't get much easier than that.                
This pedal is well made, but it is plastic. I knew that. Sound wise it compares to other similar pedals, but this is a third of the price. You get what you pay for. I leave this on the platform at church and it never moves. I don't think it would hold up to use on the road, but it's good for what I need it for and for what I paid for it. Seems like it will be reliable as long as it is taken care of.                
For the price this can't be beat. You could spend a lot more on similar items that might be built better, but you'll pay for it.                 
I have never dealt with the company. From what I've heard I don't know that I will ever have to.                
This is just a practical addition to my set up. Patty Griffin and Emmylou Harris provide sex appeal for me, not equipment.                
Good piece of equipment, depending on how long it lasts will determine my overall satisfaction with this pedal. If it were lost or stolen I would have to get another one just for the sheer value and effectiveness of it for the price.                
It's not bad at all. Tweed clean with the drive all the way down is the only setting that will actually do a truly clean setting. But it's a decent tweed sounding clean. Distortion sounds are useable and better then I expected.                 
I love the XLR output and the quarter inch (non speaker simulated) output. Very cool. I wish other sans amp units would take note of this.                 
Pretty straight forward and self explanatory. If you can use an amp you can use this.                 
Haven't had it long, but it's a bit more robust build quality then I would have expected, for the money. And for the money, if I get a year out of it, I'll be happy.                 
For the money this thing is great. It does make a bit of noise, but nothing unacceptable for a live situation. Great for a small budget studio. Or an apartment studio with no ability to use an amp. I use it for late night practice and recording without waking the whole neighborhood.                  
Never used it.                 
Overall I'm very pleased with this unit. Especially considering the price I paid for it. Had I paid more I might not have been so happy with it though.                 
The different sounds are fairly authentic. I use it primarily for recording. It hums a little more than I'd like it to...but what pedal doesn't?                
Very easy to use. Just plug in and fiddle around!                
Seems very solid. I've only used it in the studio but, I would gig with it and be confident it would meet my needs.                
Big bang for the bucks.                
It's not sexy....it just does the job well.                
Short of going out and buying three full sized amps, I couldn't ask for more from this pedal. I still have and use some 30+ year old pedals...I hope this one lasts as long. If it did break or wear out I would probably replace it.                
The unit models 3 different amps and also allows straight pass-thru. The output levels are wildly different, the tweed level is very low, the straight-thru is a little louder, and the 2 others are crazily louder, making it very tricky to switch between them. Also, even with the drive set to the lowest setting, the 2 non-tweed settings distort (my mixer wasn't indicating overload, so the distortion was coming from the Behringer).
I actually thought the unit was defective following an exchange with tech support, and ordered a different one from a different source, and it was exactly the same. The tweed setting did sound a little bluesy, but muffled (I play blues). For the record, I was playing through a Mackie FX-12 mixer and Mackie SRM 450v2 speaker; the mixer has a DI box option built into one channel, and the guitar (1980 Gibson 335s with Dirty Fingers pick-ups) sounded better through that channel and integrated DI than through the Behringer into a normal channel.                
I purchased my Ultra-G direct box out of intrigue, and I'm glad I did. I am an experienced player, performing at some of the top night clubs in Columbus, OH with built in sound and experienced sound engineers. Every one of them has complimented the sound of the Ultra-G box, and at least two of them have decided to buy some of them based on hearing how good mine sounds. It's better than a mic in a live setting when used through a conventional line out, hands down. If you think otherwise, you must be using it incorrectly.                 
For what I needed it works great. Very quiet (with explanation!!!!)
QUIET EXPLANATION:  On my unit if I tried to engage the 4x12 speaker simulation, thats when I got a low hiss, and it stayed low, would not go up in volume when I raised the volume on the guitar but did when dialed in from the amp. So it was coming from the unit but since I do not use that function, no issue for me.  Otherwise the unit does not generate any noise what so ever when used just as a DI.  
It works great and is very rugged.  No issues.  Some complain about the batter access, I again found that it seemed pretty easy to change so no issue and I have also used it phantom powered.                 
Very easy to operate, love the pad switches, very useful when going into a mixer. Love the direct line out for monitor situations.                
Well made and Rugged. Set it and forget it.                
Compared to others this pedal gives you a tremendous bang for the buck. Buy it, if you don't like it, return it or just give it to a friend.                 
No experience with support, I own a few behringer devices and pedals and all work well.  Have not had to deal with Behringer support.                
Looks Good.                
Only con to this box is the noise from engaging the speaker simulation.  Since I don't use that function.  Does not matter.                
Very clear sound.  Put my guitar "up-front."  Watch out for your levels.  I was surprised at how much this little thing puts out!                
The cab simulation is very nice.  I suppose it could be better, but not for this price!!                
Good quality.  Built very well.  And, personally, I like the way it looks.                
This gets a definite 10!  Great product, at a great price!                
Haven't had any problems, but Behringer has never given me any problems with support before.                
Very useful, a must have for the down-to-earth musician.                
Like I said, great product.                
Ive compared this to alot of others and the sound is astounding! Creates a really big sound without the hassle of micing! use a mic and this box and your every nuance will be heard live!                
I wasn't sure if I wanted to get this, but at the price and the return policy, I didn't have anything to lose. Well after the reviews, which were on point, it's gonna serve me alright. I'm using it with my Fender Rhodes 73. Didn't like it for the guitar rig because of the hiss from the cabinet simulator, and I also ran into a RED BOX Classic. If I didn't have the Classic, I would be using it, except for the cab sim. Nice for the money.                
These DI's are quite nice, only seeming to have one sonic weakness, and that is the cabinet simulation causing a fair amount of hiss.  The cabinet simulation won't satisfy everyone, but as a live sound engineer, I like its overall tone more than simply having an amp (usually with the high frequencies at painful levels) blasting away in the room.                
This DI does everything a DI should do, and slightly more.  I just wish that the cabinet simulation didn't introduce any noise into the signal.                
I had one of these suffer a death where the input jacks seemed to somehow develop a short.  I opened the DI to see if there was anything I could do, but the jacks are sealed (and soldered to a PCB.)  What opening the box revealed, though, was that you would probably have to subject the box to a rather nasty impact to actually damage the electronics.                
Behringer has a reputation for lots of features for a low price, and this DI is a perfect example of that.                
I've only spoken to Behringer once, and they seemed quite helpful.                
This is a great addition to a live sound engineer's arsenal, although it doesn't inspire the same "it's nuke-proof" response as more heavily built DI boxes might.                
I am buying at least one more of these to make up for the one that had a problem.  The 4X12 simulation puts these DI's at the head of the pack for me.                
It sounds ok, I usually use the cab sim, its a little noisy but for my application this is a non-issue.  So I take the second speaker out of my twin reverb and go to the pa board as well as my recording setup (through an xlr splitter).  I like that there's no bleed from other instruments as opposed to using a mic.  On the recordings if I add some muktiband compression and reverb it comes out sounding pretty realistic.
On the other hand, I'm not satisfied yet (who is?), so I'm still trying other boxes.                
The cab sim sounds pretty nice and with the twin reverb blasting I use both 20db pads to get it down to a reasonable level for the pa.  It seems really rugged too which is nice.                
I would like to see a couple different speaker sims ala the palmer passive DI to shape your sound a few different ways.                
Very good, I didn't expect it to be this rugged.  Although, I wish it were passive, I hate using phantom power (and no way will I trust a battery at a live show).                
Never dealt w/them                
Well its a DI, certainly not a sexy piece of gear.                
Aleays searching for something better, haven't found anything yet.  I prefer this guy to micing the amp though.                
The sound is great. No buzz, No hum and the cab simulator is fantastic! Most DI boxes I've tried on guitar heads have a High-Freq. artifact to the output, not this one. I'm not sure why others complain about noise with the cab simulator because I have not experienced this. Very quiet and no High-Freq artifact!                
Very basic design and easy to use. The battery compartment is way to small though.. better to use this via phantom power.                
Built like a tank and I've road tested mine now for over a year.. I've just ordered my second one!                
Behringer has always been priced right!                
Never had to contact support.                
I really don't want to go back to micing up my cab live anymore. This box solved allot of live sound problems and I've got the rest of my boys using one as well. On my last CD I even recorded all of my solo's using just the Ultra-G (my head - Ultra G - ProTools) and it worked great (box handles 500W!!).. I can't live without it now!                
Overall this product is killer.. I'm still curious as to why others complain about noise with this but so far live and in the studio I have not seen this problem (I always run balanced lines so maybe they're converting over to unbalanced or something??) Anyway, I'm very impressed with the Ultra-G and for it's price you can't beat it! - MX  www.phist-productions.com                
Very realistic emulation of a mic-ed cabinet. A world of difference between simply running a DI and running the emulator. I very much prefer the sound of using the Behringer after my preamp over simply using a Tech21 Sansamp.                
Active single channel DI with "4x12" cabinet emulator. If only it came in dual channel version, for running stereo, and more options on the speaker emulation.                
Decent build quality. But as I noticed with some Behringer products, the battery compartment is a no brainer. It is way too small, making it difficult to insert and remove the battery. And they should have a more accessible cover as well. A screw over a metal plate isn't exactly the best idea.                
Excellant for the money!                
Never dealt with em, but their website is pretty informative.                
I went from DI to DI lookin for the right sound, this nails it right on. I want the freedom to use my own preamp & efx processors and have a DI box that has a speaker emulator. Sansamps sound terrible for that, only decent running standalone.                
Great product, will definately buy another in a heartbeat if this one gets lost.                
Cabinet emulation, which is why I bought this though I have Ultra DI100 from Behringer (which by the way works great!) makes a lot of noise. Cabinet feature is USELESS.
DI is great just as its cousin DI100. 
But forget the cabinet emulation.                
This baby cranks!!! Wanted to feed my headphones from my mixer rather than my 200 watt amp in my rack, but the output was took low for my "too long" in biz ears"....the little Behringer amp did the trick for 20 bucks! Fairly clean, and loud.                
4 separate amps with individual controls.                
Very simple to use                
Nice metal box...the knobs feel solid.                
no experience                
not sexy just works                
Clean, punchy and clear-no noise that I can hear. Drives even difficult headphones well.                
Comes with it's own wall wart- nice. Does what it should.                
4 individual volume knobs...how much easier can it get?                
Rating of 9, not 10 'cause there's gotta be a catch somewhere. Solid aluminum case. Don't step on it and it'll last for a long time.                
Direct dealer exchange for faulty product, responsive email support.                
I got one and gave it to my church. Now I want one for ME!                
This is being used in an unusual way- coming off of the matrix output of a Mackie Onyx large format mixer to distribute a non house mix to video and audio recording. The live mix is too heavy on vocals and keyboard, since everyone else uses their amps onstage. The matrix submix lets us compensate for that, and the HA400 lets me distribute that mix cleanly to different recorders at different levels. Perfect to feed a collection of pro- and consumer-grade units the church uses!                
Don't care what people say about Behringer, they make great, affordable products. Won't say much about this one except read the other reviews cause they're spot on! For the low price, thus headphone amp rocks! I will warn however that if you purchase it with the 4 Samson headphones (which I actually recommend doing) don't expect them to sound good. In fact, they're pretty crappy lol. That being said, you aren't going to be using them for sound quality. They're just for letting musicians play at the same time to get through the recording process. Again, the headphones are crap but for the extra $25 they'll serve their purpose and are worth the extra few bucks. Just make sure whoever is wearing them knows that you know they suck but they get the job done.                 
The sound is "LOUDER". it takes ANY one of my state of the art headphones and increases the volume much more than before. The sound is going to still vary depending on your headphones.
I own: regular ipod earbuds, cheap no brand head phones, Sennheiser 280HD, Logitech NCH, Bose Over ear, and Ultrasone HFI700.
ipod earbuds: with the amp, the sound was just louder, bleh. just pretend turning up the volume on the earphones until they blow. a bit distorted after turning them to high.
cheap headphones: theres no brand. they sound like crap. with the amp they sounded much better. but to me the sound was still pretty bad. 
Sennheiser 280HD: These are awesome cans to begin with and without the amp these are my favorite headphones because its high in quality and its cheap! They produce amazing highs and mids but lack a punchy bass. with the amp, they made these headphones with a much punchier bass but the highs sometimes were to high. nothing is distorted but just SUPER LOUD!!! which is a good thing because all you have to do is make sure your source volume is somewhat lower and bring the amp power higher. overall it made an improvement with my headphones but when it comes down to it. I can live without the amp with these headphones since these are almost perfect for what they are.  
Logitech NCH: These logitech head phones have decent amount of bass. the highs and mids are average but with the amp it was almost a world of a difference. i tried listening to music with these but the bass was just too much after awhile but then i put on a movie and it was almost insane! i think these would be the perfect movie headphone when paired with this amp because it makes the highs and mids better and the bass much more explosive. so when you're watching a scene where theres a huge explosion you can hear the sharpness and the earthshaking bass. ok maybe earthshaking is wAAAAAy exaggerated but thats okay because its still quite noticeable. overall, the amp is a must with these headphones.
Bose Over ear: I know a lot of audiophiles wouldnt say a lot about bose because there are much better stuff out there like Grado, AKG, Sennheiser, etc. but i really like these headphone because its probably the most well balanced headphones I've ever listen too. Its has good highs and mids while having a very VERY thumping bass. perfect for any music genre. these headphones become very powerful when connected to this amp. since these headphones are so well balanced everything becomes enhanced in every way. Again, the amp is a must accessory with my bose headphone.
Ultrasone HFI700: This headphone is my pride and joy. No one touches these or puts them on but me. music just sounds different with these headphones. when i say different, i mean it in the best way as possible. The sound can not be explained. it just cant. no matter what i say, no matter what i type, no matter how hard i try nothing will be able to describe how good these cans are. Now as i paired it with the amplifier the headphone became a live. 
no feature. it does one thing. adds more power to the headphones to give louder/ sound. but ask yourself, is louder better? HELL YEAH IT IS!                
its so easy even you can do it. = )                
alloy casing. average weight for its size. if i dropped it i wouldn't be concerned because its built VERY sturdy.                 
c'mon dude 20 bucks for a mini amp that can make your ears bleed?! FTW!                
the best support is no support. if i didnt have to pick up the phone to call then everything is alllllllllll good.                
i wanted to see how much better it could improve some of my head phones.                  
I'm completely satisfied with this product. Just understand that this amp will improve the sound by making your content LOUDER. since i own only 1 earbud i really can't be much help to other owners who perfer earbuds. in my own test, i found that the ipod earbuds is not needed. adjusting the volume knob on the amp to high will cause the earphones to get distorted very easily. As for headphones, it is a must. whether you like listening to rock, death metal, country, classical, blues, hiphop or watch dvds it will make your experience much more enjoyable. 
I'm going to find away to  hook this up to XBOX 360 and play gears of war on my headphones i bet it would be amazing as well.                 
Does what it was made for amplifying the signal very nice and clean (using a nice pair of headphones of course). y use it as extra monitor output with clarett 8pre                
I bought 2 of these to replace homemade ones without volume controls in my studio.  The price was great and they were shipped quickly.  I tested all of the outputs and everything works great on them.  I was surprised at how small they are and was expecting them to be a little bigger but the size doesn't bother me.  They don't seem to add any noise to the signal path and they look good.                
better than I hoped for ,I bought the pack with the 4 nady phones was worried about the bad rap the phone have but so far they have held up fine .The amp is plug and play simple and noise free . For the price it was worth a shot .only problem I have is the line in and headphone outs are on the same side of the unit                 
I bought the Behringer Headphone Amp with the Nady Headphone Package (with four sets of headphones). Obviously, in a bundle like this, I didn't expect the headphones to be great, but they're adequate. The in-line, volume adjustment is a plus, but the stereo mini to stereo 1/4" adapters are sub-par. 2 out of 4 are useless.                 
Very pleased with the service and quality. Arrived in record time. Thank You so much.                
Hum and noise are non-existant.  I use the amp at low volume levels for late night TV viewing.  The bass is tight and the highs are smooth.  I am very happy with my purchase.                
Simple and easy to use.  Most all of my connections are 3.5mm, so had to find adaptors, but would rather have 1/4 phone as they seem to hold up longer.  Have had problems in other equipment with 3.5mm jacks breaking.                
Plug it in and go.  Didn't need a manual.                
I would have paid the price for a single channel amp.  This has 4.                
Did not have to contact company.                
This product is not sexy.  It is a practical design that gets the job done.                
This will last me a very long time.  I might consider buying a second one for the car so the kids can watch a dvd when we travel.                
My home studio set up is on a tight budget, and I just needed several singers to monitor tracks while laying down vocals.  There seems to be plenty of power (volume) in the headphones with no discernable distortion even at high volumes.                
This cost $19.99 - so don't expect any features besides individual volume controls.  It is perfect for what it is.                
Plug it in and go!                
Very simple metal box, single LED, 4 knobs.  All seems pretty solid.  I've had no trouble at all using it so far.  I was skeptical what I would get for so low a price, but I feel like this is a value!                
Seems like a great value for the price!                
N/A                
This is not a sexy item.  This is a "gets the job done, and done well on the cheap" type of item.                
This will do for me until the time comes when I am sure I want to invest more money into a more professional home studio.  When I do, Behringer will be my first choice.                
I ride a motorcycle and have three input devices.  Radar detector (mono), XM radio (stereo needs amplified), could have GPS mono voice.  The mixer/amp worked great on the motorcycle and the individual volume levels for each input was usful on set up.  During driving, the individual devices (except XM) could be adjusted.  If radar went off in city, its volume could be turned down.                
Could you build one that has 1/8th inch input/output.  Again, I see a great motorcycle potential as is and even better with modifications.  The modifications should not cost $55.00 but you could ask that much more for an "improved" product.                
I give sound a ten because i cant find anything wrong with it. seems clear and loud. no complaints.                
I give features 7 beacuse although it is incredibly ease to maintain and operate, it does not have the simplest or most functional feature, the ON/Off switch. You basically have to keep it plugged in and theres a glowing green light that gets kind of annoying if its on all the time. so leave it plugged in, or bend over to plug it in every time.                 
Could not be easier to use. plug and go! no instructions needed!!                
very light, almost too light. but straight, and to the point. i had to put four little rubber feet on the bottom so it didnt scratch my other gear and so i didnt have to hold it with both hands to plug something in/out.                
cannot be beat for the price! Period! I would have paid AT LEAST twice what it costs if i were to guess.                
havent needed any...                
Sex appeal?? hardly. its a rigid little metal box with pointy corners and knobs sticking out...but if your into that sort of thing, thats a whole other story...                
Overall had to give 9. it functions well and cannot be beat for the price. but could not give a 10 for lack of the ON/OFF switch. other than that. its excellent.                
I shopped several brands and models of headphone amps for GizmoProductions.net, and wanted something portable to move to where the artists were recording, so that THEY could have control of their volume, similar to an Aviom. It works great for 2-4 vocalists or a vocalist/guitarist duo, or any other configuration. Great price, great simplicity, sturdy construction, and a great deal with the optional headphones!                
Don't waste your money.  I understand that it only costs $20 and you can't expect it to knock your socks off but I thought I'd be able to get a reasonable volume level out of it! BAH!!!  I can't get it turned up even a quarter of the way it's all noise, noise and noise. It's junk.  RUN AWAY NOW!!!                
not too shabby! (for behringer...)                
well, it does what it's supposed to. I dont think this product exactly
has any "features!"
Dear Behringer:
In the next model, please put the headphone jacks on the front and the
input/power on the back! (duh!!) And make it rackable with a bunch next to it. And give it some pretty lights. And make the space where it says "level 1, level 2" a whiteboard-like material that you can use wipable markers on. Or better yet, make it a big LED screen programmable by USB, so I can put the name of each person's mix on it. Oh and I guess while you're at it, please add Auxiliary inputs and blend pots. And make the power supply internal. Or battery powered. Or both. Am I asking too much?                
It's metal - nice one boys!                
OK I gotta admit it's dirt-friggin-cheap and does exactly what they advertise. I don't feel ripped off having bought this; I knew exactly
what I was getting into.                
N/A/ Who the heck needs tech support for a headphone amp like this? I can't believe I'm writing this review....                
Just saw it, bought it, whatever.                
I wasn't exactly searching the world over for something like this. I do get a lot of comments about it though. 6/10.                
the 60hz hum is ridiculus. cant believe nobody has noticed this, a waste of good money                
This product sounds fine if you're simply hooking headphones directly into the unit.  In fact, it sounds quite good.  However, it DOES NOT WORK over long distances (25' - 50') of low gauge wire, such as a snake.  I believe this is due to impedance issues.                
This has the basic features you need to split and individually amp a signal 4 times.  It lacks 1/8" in/out, but that's solved using an adapter.                
Doesn't get any easier than this.                
This unit looks and works fine.  The knobs feel a little chintzy, but not too bad.  However, I have other Behringer equipment that feels a lot sturdier than this, so this is certainly not their shining product.                
Impedance issues aside, this is a very good deal.                
It's functional, but not sexy.                
The unit sounds good, but only if you're jacking a pair of headphones directly into it.  It doesn't work over long runs of low gauge wire (such as a snake), making it unsuitable for many professional/semi-pro studios.  I returned the unit and bought an ART HeadAmp4 - WELL WORTH THE EXTRA $20.  The ART is much better built, the knobs feel nicer, it's stackable, and it has 1/8" and 1/4" jacks.  If you have a pro studio, go with the ART.  If you've got a small home studio and don't intend to expand, the Behringer will probably work well for you.                
I got this thing as we(the band) needed it because during recording our drummer had a hard time hearing the guitar/bass tracks(we're using an fostex x-16) and therefore had a hard time keeping tempo, He was never really of by much, but as a musician I am sure you know already it doesn't take much to ruin a good tune by being just a hair off tempo.                
Simple device                
Just plug in your headphones and crank the volume up, Doesn't get much easier than that.                
Have had no problems so far, It's built pretty tough although it just rests on a desktop for recording so I haven't really tested it in rougher conditions than the home studio. I am also really gentle on all my gear so I don't foresee any major problems with this box.                
We bought this amplifier mainly because of the drummer he can now actually hear everything the guitars are doing and hits the timing dead on like he should so that makes it worth quite a bit to us. The other neat feature is we can hook up multiple headphones now also, so while I am mixing tracks the rest of my bandmates can grab a pair a headphones and listen to the mixdown as well.                 
Haven't needed any support.                
It's perfect for what we needed for. If you happen to record your rough drafts & demos on old school equipment like us this will help you out for sure. Heck, even if you use more modern equipment it doesn't hurt to have a volume boost for your headphones. It also seems to bring out some good definition in the sound as well. Overall I'd say buy one even if you think you may not need it. It's defiently a useful tool to have hanging around just in case.                
The channels that worked were clean, but the first one I received had a dead left channel on the #1 output. I returned it and they sent me another which had dead left channel on #2 out put. Exchanged it for an ART unit which seems to be working very well.                
The two units I have had both had bad out puts.                
I use this to amplify my claretts 8pre outputs via TS cable direct into the HA8000 inputs, being able to make separate monitor mixes via DAW. The signal amplification is just perfect and enought to track or as daily use. Love it                
Bought this headphone amp back in March of this year.  While it worked, it  did what it was supposed to do.  However, it just quit on me two days ago.  So, all told it lasted me exactly 6 months.  That's what I get for trying to buy on the cheap.  Do yourself a favour and steer clear of this Behringer product.                
I absolutely love the sound of this pedal.  I (like most of us) am very meticulous with my sound and this Hellbabe pedal really hit the mark.  I'm able to use it quite comforably with Damageplan, BLS and Metallica-style covers.  I also use the Ibanez Weeping Demon - a good pedal, but the Ibanez sucks a little tone (still good for less 'heavy' uses), whereas I don't have that same issue with the Hellbabe.                
Real simple to use with the optical on-off.  I haven't experienced the 'noise' issue others have in the ratings, but I did experience the pedal not switching off automatically when I removed my foot.  I opened the case (from the bottom) like I had to do with my old Morley and pushed the optical 'eye' down just slightly and BAM, problem fixed.  So...I don't know how long it'll hold up with gigging (I've found myself being a little more tender with it now when moving it around), but there are very few moving parts so it'll be an easy adjustment if something goes outta whack.  The plastic casing is fine.                
I've had Crybaby's/Morley/and Ibanez and they've all had 'issues' of some sort, so the fact I had to minimally adjust the optical eye is not an issue to me.  It's been fine ever since and sounds awesome.                
Absolutely fantastic.  It IS, for all intents-and-purposes, the Dimebag Wah (for $150) but for $29 (minus the metal dime-o-flage casing).                  
I haven't needed it...that's the best kind of support.                
Well...I chose a nine because it looks like every other standard wah...nothing more special (or less).                
If I totally break (or lose) this thing, I'll definitely replace it with another Behringer Hellbabe....definately.                
Adjustable tones                
Good quality                
It does what it's supposed to at a fraction of the cost.  I dare you to find another Wah pedal for less than this one.                
It's a perfectly good pedal.                
I don't see any need to buy a more expensive pedal.  What can other wah pedals do that this one can't?  If you want a good pedal for a great price, this is it.                
The overall sound of this unit is every bit as good as Dunlop Wah
its designed to emulate, I tried this thing side by side with a Dimebag Crybaby before i bought it and the difference in sound was
very minute. Comparibly an excellent effect at a fraction of the
cost of its rival.                
This product features a few very usefull controls that you don't
find on every wah, Q-control, adjustable frequency range, I.E.-
highs and Lows, toe down range control, and a boost level adjustment,
not to mention the fact that its activated by optical control instead of a push button toe switch.You do however have to play around with the boost and time adjustment for the on/off switch to avoid excessive noise during paused playing parts.                
The guts of this effect seem to perform very well, however the 
body is only high impact plastic , but it seems quite solid.
The one thing they could do to improve this unit is to put
the guts in a metal case.                
Very good value for the price.                
No service needed so far.                
Well its not really an attractive effect, but it does its job and
sounds good in the process. It was a practical addition to my
set up,i bought 2 of these to use in my pedal boards for my Pantera tribute band.                
I'm very content with these units, if they broke I'd probably
replace the unit with the same. I like the fact that this unit sounds
every bit as good as the other $200 wahs that i already own, at a third of the cost.                
I dont know how I lived without it,even playin with myself its better than sex.                
Worst feature unfortunately is its low power comsumption,when plugged into a normal power supply,around 800ma,it clips badly losing much of
its dynamic sound range(which really is quite good).I'd like to see it with own power supply built in,right now,(I use wall warts).Dont think it actually needed all that gain,but its handy,I guess.                
Just plug it in and get your ROCKS OFF!                
Seems solidly built,but I'm not that abusive with musical instraments,after thirty some years playing with minimal monies coming in a person learns to take care of things.                
Kiler diller!                
Not yet.                
Well designed,well built,very responsive too my desires.Sh goes well with other mind candy,very compatible type,a nice personality that goes well its other traits.                
A while.It stands on its own merits.Wanted similar for quite some time but purchased things for other instraments,flute,and am now plenty glad that I found this one and think I would seek out another identical to it.                
Got a Mprley Pro2, and this bad Pedal puts it to shame.If you master the adjustments, it kicks.Made solid,ease of use. Also have after that a Ultra Wah, what a combo.It will take a beating, supply is only $10,(do a little shopping).I like it better that Dunlop, Morley, and price is Great.                
Makes a little click that's annoying when the wah is activated.                
Not Bad                
READ THE DIRECTIONS!!                
Plastic seems to stand up OK.  I own one and my son also owns one and both have had the hinge pin slip out the right side requiring that after some use you have to push it back in.  Otherwise yo may be surprised with a loose pedal                
Compared to the price of others, this is a great value...                
Haven't had to contact them for support.                
Looks fine...Hey it's a pedal.                
I would rather have a Crybaby, but for the price and my budget at the time, this was fine.                
It sounds the same or better than all the other pedals i've tried. It has a knob that lets you change the ammount of wah which is useful.                
It has a boost feature and you can change the ammount of wah you want. I find the springback feature on this pedal easier to use than the Crybaby style one, but thats just a matter of personal taste.                 
Its a wah peadal. Not exactly complicated.                
It seems fairly rugged, however i would not be confident to stand on it. I think it'll last a few years but deffinately not for ever. But then it only cost 30 pounds.                
Great value for 30 pounds. It will probably last a while and does the job just as well as a more expensive model would.                
I dont know.                
I'd rather have a crybaby but this is a great pedal for intermediate use.                
Works very well for what it is, great value for money. It does everything I'd expect it to and when it breaks i'l buy another one.                
You definitely get a wah sound with this pedal, and the controls do offer tweakability.But the biggest thing that I have against this pedal is the limited range of the wah.HEY BERINGER...MORE RANGE, PLEASE.I consider this an excellent value at 30 bucks.I have used it alone, and in combination with the digital effects on my Beringer GMX212 amp, which is a very cool combination.I also put this behind a Big Muff Pi in the effects chain with good results (be patient and experiment).If I lost it, I'd get another one.Well made and durable.Buy it and you will find a use for it...I did!!!!                
More controls than a plain jane pedal.                
Tweak controls take a little getting used to; more subtle than most pedals.                
Well made, holds up to my big heavy feet.                
It's worth the price I paid for it, and then some.                
I have several Beringer products and so far have never needed support.                
Attractive and sturdy design.                
Even though I will be getting more wah pedals in the future, this one will be used often, and usually in conjunction with other stomp boxes.                
Does not suck tone. Very impressive wah sound with other features that make this pedal worth every penny. The boost is activated with the pedal slightly pressed forward, the wah is activated by pushing the pedal more forward. The range is very limited, but this can be overcome by modifying (voiding warranty) the board attached to the foot pedal inside the unit. This gives it a fuller useful range. The mod makes it a 10.                 
The boost and Q range for tonal quality is a plus for this pedal.                
Same as any other wah pedal - press pedal and it is activated.                
Hard plastic that is sturdy. I have dropped several pedal by Behringer and haven't had any crack or stop working, so I imagine this will apply to this pedal as well. I don't have any backup pedals as these Behringer's seem tank worthy. Remember the old Fisher-Price toys that are made of plastic that your kids couldn't destroy. Well, these can be compared to those toys.                
Best value for any wah pedal! With the boost and Q-settings make this even a better value than any wah pedal.                
I had two of these pedals come in not working properly. Behringer and ZZounds are quick to answer and resolve the problem. I give both a ten(10), very rare these days.                
Excellent addition to my gear. Not sexy, but is a technical marvel. Haven't seen anything else out there like it.                
If stolen I would replace it, I notice that the price is going up.                
pretty good with an ibanez tone blaster                
could have had more, but what was there was good                
i had it running and annihilating in about 5 minutes after i bought the 9-volt battery                
for that cheap it's pretty awesome.                
totally worth the money. if you've got more $$, go with the dunlop crybaby, but if your budget is low, go for it.                
oh yeah. it's awsesome. it looks cool with my black guitar and black amp.                
for beginners, this is a pretty good, non-pricey pedal. reccommended!                
It's great. Some reviews indicate that the pedal is rather subtle, but I find that with a little tweaking it sounds just right.                
It would be nice if it had an integrated PSU/came with a wallwart, but other than that I really don't have any complaints. It's got a Q control to vary the shape of the wah from a more "round" to a "sharp" sound, and a "fine tune" control which apparently adjusts the high end. I'd rather have a pedal that had a click switch to turn on and off; the automatic off feature of this is a bit annoying if it's turned down too short.                
It might take a little bit of tweaking to get the right sound. Once it's set up, though, there's not much to it-put your foot on it and go.                
The plastic construction seemed a little dodgy when I was looking at it, but I don't think it's an issue-there's a thick metal plate on the bottom which should lend support, and the entire pedal feels solid.                
This seems to be the cheapest wah available, but it definitely doesn't sound/feel cheap.                
I haven't had a need to contact the company.                
If price was no issue, I don't know if I'd choose this pedal over any other.                
If it was stolen, I'd buy another.                 
When I first plugged the hb in i was a little dissapointed. But, after just turning a few of the REALLY useful knobs, (Q, range, fine tuning, boost) I got the sound i was really looking for. I have a Jackson dxmg with passive emgs, and a Crate GTD65. I play Metallica!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Guns N Roses, Iron Maiden and this thing works well for solos. For $30, you can't beat it.                
I love the Q control the fine tuning(pretty much presence),  and range. More features than any  other wah i know. You can really fine tune your sound. There is also a boost, it does exactly that, boosts your sound. However, it is NOT an overdrive. It just boosts your sound a little bit like turning  the master volume a quarter inch. can get muddy if all the way up.                 
Pretty easy to use nice knobs for everything. wish the button for the boost was not on the side so you could actually use it live. I love the spring. I also love that you just have to put your foot on it.                
I just got the wah today. There where no loose parts. I was really surprised at the weight and sturdiness of it. It is metal.                
Way cheaper than CryBaby or Vox. Also has great q control that i love. It is not a Crybaby or vox it is unique. And 30 bucks.                
Have never dealt with Behringer. ZZOUNDS IS AMAZING!!! They had it at my door in two days! i ordered ground shipping! Also great order tracking and support.                
Sexy black and steel. Q control. i like it.                
I've been playing for 10 months more than half an hour 7 days a week. I love the price because i'm 13 and can't afford 100 for a wah. I love that i can play the Enter Sandman solo and have it sound good! If it was stolen I'd find the guy and beat him with the wah. if it were stolen i'd buy it again or wait and get the Pod xt live or vox tonelab because i've been wanting to get one of those                
Sound is where the pedal really lacks. First, it adds noise when in the up position (straight guitar). Next, even with straight guitar it changes the tone of the sound, adds a little too much treble. I've tried many settings and configurations and I just can't get it to leave my tone alone. The actual wah effect sounds good.                
Has a ton of options. Not sure they all work exactly as they are supposed to, but it has more options than many pedals on the market. I really like the default to straight guitar feature.                
It's a wah pedal. Pretty easy to use.                
Built well. Has some plastic that may not hold up well if gigging regularly, but due to the tone change I wouldn't even consider this as part of my stage rig.                
$29.99, it's a great value. Perfect pedal for practice.                
I've never had to use Behringer support, but they do offer quite a bit online. Most of their products perform exactly as one would expect for the price being paid.                
Nothing spectacular about it.                
I'll always use this pedal in my practice room at home. I won't ever put it on a stage. Seems to built well enough that I won't ever have to worry about it breaking. I've got other Behringer stuff and it holds up well.                
 This is the same sound you get out of any other wah pedal. It sounds great for rock music, jazz music, country music, or whatever else you may play. The settings can be slightly adjusted to change the boost of sound when using wah or the amount of wah. It sounds great on guitar, and you can play it on bass, but I would recommend a wah pedal made specificully for bass.                
 This product has a couple of features that let you adjust the amount of wah or the sound boost, and also some other stuff. You will really like the spring-back feature and the grip.                
 There is a learnig curve in using this product, but there is going to be a learning curve using all wah pedals. Once you get used to it it will be easy to use, with great playability. If you are playing an uncommon style of music it may be hard to get your specific sound you desire and you will have to rely on your amp.                
 It comes with a nice spring-back feature and sound boost controls. It also comes with other features that can control other aspects like the amount of wah in use. I am confident in it's durability in fact I would be fine with people jumping on it. It is built very well.                
 With the low price and great sound this is a must buy. Do not go and buy a wah pedal for over $100. I wouldn't even buy one over $50 because this sounds exactly the same.                
I have never dealt with this company.                
 This is a just a simple wah pedal. There is nothing really special about it other than it's great price and sound.                
 I am confident that this will be the only wah pedal I will ever buy, until I break this one. Has great features and sound. If this pedal ever breaks, or something, I will get the exact same one due to the great price and sound. It gives me the exact sound I want.                
the sound is perfect.the only thing is the click sound it makes wen u it powers on an off.it sounds awesome on amps 20 watts or higher.it can be used for bass but it doesnt sound that good                
it has a boost button w/ sum volume tone knob like things.it has a range knob which it plays with the tone.                
it can be a pain to use.u cant bring it all the way up cuz itll shut off.it works well with delay and revrb really well(boss pedals the work best).                
evn tho its plastic its vry durable.i would rely on it wit my life it is so good..it would be perfect for any gig                
best wah for the price.it is just like dunlops dimebag crybaby.for evry1 with a small budget an want a wah get this1                
it is perfect for classic rock,metal,u name it.its perfect                
i will use this forever.or until they make another1                
This has a great sound. I use it for a bunch of the solos i do. Sounds a lot like metallica.                 
Everything you need, althogh i dont understand why you need 2 outut switches.                
You just push it down.                 
It broke within a month. Whenever i push it down, it makes a very loud spealing noise, and when its on clean, the sound gets taken way from my guitar even when its not pushed down. Its cheap.                 
Its a good value for as long as it still works.                 
Impossible to find any ansers on the behringher site.                
When i saw it i wanted it but now i wish i had saved up for the crybaby.                 
I need another wah-wah. Its definetely a good thing to have, but there is no way im getting it from behringher.                 
This is a very nice sounding wah pedal. I would even say it is as good as the crybaby sometimes. I played some old 60s Clapton style stuff with it and it sounded spot on!                
It has a fully customizable range and boost features to get the tone your looking for                
I had to monkey with this pedal beacuse it was shipped broken to me, In an idle position, I would not get my regular guitar sound. If you are logical and intuitive, you could fix it. (I did my wedging a piece of wood into the pedal to make it always on XD)                
It broke before it got here... it is a cheap plastic piece of junk. I have never really gone "on the road" at all, so I would not know... The optical eyes was a mistake on Behringer's part.                 
If you want to take the time to mod it to your likeing then it is worth it.                
I didn't have to talk to them at all                
This was my first pedal so I wanted it bad.                
I like this pedal a lot. It's range feature gives you about any tone you want. I know many people think this pedal is junk, but if you want good tone for a cheap price GO FOR IT!!!                
i am almost a professional guitarist and this thing plays better than most wah pedals on the market. it is now my main wah pedal.                
all of the controlls work great and if you happen to break the product its just like $30 so its not too much of a los if you break it.                
the spring is perfect with just enough resistance                
mostly plastic but for the price who can argue?                
its not that good looking but i dont care sound is all i care about                
The Hellbabe is very attractive with its multitude of features at a very competitive price. I liked the switchless operation (but disliked the deactivation timer) and the boost function a lot. I found the sound to be "ok". Not as nice as a Crybaby or a Morley, but it did the job. However, in my experience the sound gets worse with time. After about two months of use, it started to make "popping" sounds when the effect was active, and the wah effect itself was getting less and less pronounced. This is not due to a bad battery; I use a DC adapter with it. I would guess that a capactor has gone bad. This thing is now useless to me. The Hellbabe is also a less than ideal platform for modding, since the electronics are all surface mounted. You would be better off with a low end offering from Dunlop or Morley; at least that would be something that you could mod to be useful.                
This is a pretty awesome sounding pedal - Beats my old Boss V-Wah which was about 4 times as expensive and about 4 times as noisy in use/                
Excellent - tweakable q control, fine tuning and a preset boost with side-switch operation - like the top end Dunlop wahs.                
So easy - any stting sounds good. And it even sounds good with my Jazz Bass, since I can tweak the sound to suit the instrument.                
Here's where it falls down. The casing is solid, the electronics haven't broken, but what has happened is that the pin holding the treadle to the bass falls out when the pedal is used vigorously. And the wah doesn't operate until halfway through it's upward travel. Sort the quality out, Behringer. May have to modify it to suit...                
Come on, you find an optical wah with boost and fine tuning and Q control for this money...                 
Hmmm...                
It's a black wah pedal - not exactly unusual, huh?                
If I can successfully iron out the faults, then I'll be thoroughly impresses. If not, well, I only wasted                 
The sound is good for bass players as you can adjust the frequency affected. The fine tune knob helps dial in the right frequency for your instrument and the Q know adjusts the peak (high peak or more mellow peak)                
There is a boost function in case you need a little more gain, but i don't need that as a bass player. It doesn't use pots, so as it gets old, you won't have a lot of static when you move the pedal.                 
Pretty straight forward, although it takes a little time to find the right sound. the pedal activates once you push it down. One downside to this pedal is that it will deactivate if you leave it up too long, but you can adjust that.                
Metal base and solid plastic body. It feels very reliable and it would be fine for regular use. I don't recommend throwing it down a flight of stairs to test it, but it looks and feels like it could take some abuse.                
This product is definitely a great buy. At $40-50, this product performs very well.                
I haven't dealt with Behringer yet, as the product is working just fine. Zzounds, however, is amazing. I found this product advertized on amazon.com for a cheaper price, and Zzounds were happy to beat it. I got it for $39.54 with free shipping!                
I like how well it worked with my setup (Fender Jazz Bass, Markbass Mini CMD 121p). I have it going through my effects loop and it sounds great! I did laugh, though, when I got home and saw the box it came in. It came in a box that was 2'x1.1' 1"x9". Clearly a giant box for this item, but it was protected well and gave me a good laugh!                
Great Pedal for one who does not wish to pay $80+ for a decent wah!                 
it's quiet normal, but sometimes it starts to crack or something like that                
Many options, but not very usefull                
Quiet easy                
Not very happy, because it's made of plastic and top part of pedal is shaking and I'm afraid it will broke :|                
Product worth its price ! I'm happy about ths pice, because I wanted to try out the Wahs and it had the best price of them all                 
it's normal                
It's not the best wah and it is not very resistance, but if you don't have much money and want to try out the wahs, then it's the best deal !                
I just got this pedal, plugged it in. The sweep is horrible! It also makes a weird popping when you let off the pedal. its not like a normal wah you cant leave it in different positions. It has a spring that disengages the pedal when you lift your foot. I tried adjusting the different controls to get some kind of usable tone but then after playing for like twenty minutes it just stopped working all together. I love Behringer pedals. I know they are cheaply constructed, but this pedal is a joke!                 
Behringer's Hellbabe wah pedal is well-built, sounds gutsy and provides great value. The guitarist in my band uses this as his single pedal wah of choice, especially for its nice price. (he useshis multiple effects Boss ME-50 for his main wah sound, with its excellent and spacey modulation capabilities.) The Hellbabe is similar-sounding to a dunlop wah with a little less grit to its sound. It's not like a Morley wah at all, which I'd like to own for keyboards. I'm purchasing the Hellbabe (and a Behringer reverb machine vintage reverb pedal) with my next $100. If you need a broad or special, sweepable "Q" , then this is't the pedal for you- many of this sort of wah are available- but if you want and need a good, overall wah at a sweet price, then get to know this Babe!

the sound wasn't to bad, it didn't offer enough "tweakability" for me. it made very mild sounds compared to what i wanted it to do. i played with all the knobs i could find and it didn't give me the sound i was really wanting, but at 30 bux it wasn't horrible.                 
features kinda suck, there are alot in terms of what u can look at, but im a man of specific taste when it comes to sound and the features didn't matter because they didn't do enough for me at all. also, i'd like to be able to click the pedal on and off instead of having it be optical. that part kinda sucked cuz of the lag time.                
its pretty simple, there were a few knobs on the side that i thought did very little for the quality of the wah, but it is very straightforward.                
its a 30 dollar berhinger, and u get exactly that. i decided to make a pedal board today and had to take the rubber feet off the bottom of the pedal, the screws holding the feet in were crap. after i finally got the feet off and somehow managed to get the screws back in i saw an adjustment for the bypass delay time or something like that on the back, i decided to give that a shot and see what happened. the damn thing broke off inside the pedal, so i had to unscrew the pedal (the screws now have NO head on them and are completely useless, and the piece to adjust the bypass delay time is done for. i tried fixing it but couldn't get it to work, so now my pedal is stuck with like 3ish seconds of bypass delay time and not even worth the trip to throw it out. i've had other berhinger products and they are very cheap, but they are also very poorly made and almost always of low quality, this pedal was no exception.                 
i owned the pedal for about a year and a half till it did went tits up on me. so if ur on a tight budget and just want a very basic wah pedal this one is a good bet, just don't expect it to hold up forever. but if u aren't worrying about money go with like a morley or the good 'ol crybaby                
haven't had to deal with them directly. i looked around on their website and the way they word their warranty it looks like they don't wanna give up any more services than they absolutely have to.                
its a wah pedal, not to much flair going on. just basic, but it gets the job done                
i think im gunna save up and buy a decent wah, or possibly like the EHX  HOG  that thing is awesome, and incorporated wah, with many other things it can do.                
This pedal has tried to give the user a variety of wah sounds but really fails to give anything that is close to any of the common wah's that we are used to.                 
Plenty of adjustments but they don't really do a whole lot or really help to improve or change the overall sound. Would be better to have less or no features and at least produce ONE good wah effect.                
Read the manual, it's not a supercomputer.                 
The case is sturdy enough for general use. The pin that hold the pedal to the base works loose all the time. The tiny piece of card that moves inside the unit that activates the optical sensor is junk. It has to be cut manually by the user to get the wah to really work properly...that means opening up the unit and using a calculated guess to get it right.                 
I think I paid 29 bucks for mine, now they are 40!! guess if you are really poor you could buy it as a foot exerciser.                 
Never dealt with Behringer.                
It takes up space in my closet, it's a good door stop...too big for a paper weight.                 
Forget it, come on now guys, just pay the extra $30 and at least get a Dunlop Original, it'll give you a real 'wah' and last for donkeys.                  
The boost of this pedal is very nice, could not get the blasted thing to work properly on wah setting, take off your foot, and the effect defaults to regular guitar sound......not good.                
I found the fact that if you take off your foot, it basically defaults to straight guitar was not a good thing. In fact, I tried to adjust that factor outta the mix and just plain gave up on it. Sold it for less than I paid to get something else.                
Maybe it was just me, but I wish I had just paid the extra money and bought a good old Cry baby, now there is a pedal that you can take your foot off, and lo and behold it will play for decades like mine, 30 yrs and still works like a champ, duct tape and all.                
built like a brick outhouse, but if you cannot count on it to work if your foot is off from it, why even worry if it was made outta paper mache?                
My opinion of the pedal is this....buy something else..CRYBABY whatever.                
Here I gotta say that Behringer did do right by me when my GMX212 went belly up. Called em up, and they gave me a shipping number for ups and even shipped me a brand new one the next day. There I would say they went the extra mile. Maybe my pedal was defective. I guess I should have tried...I did not.....not their fault.                
Like kissing your sister.....butt ugly sister at that. EWWWWWWWW! no wait, I like that!not really just fooling.                
I fiddled with it for over a yr and finally gave up.....I am not some brainiac, but I think the instructions are a might hard to cypher.....                
Really great sounding wah!!  Very responsive and dynamic.  It gives you exactly what you want from a wah pedal and much, much more.  The tone is incredible, and almost infinitely tweakable.  You can dial in super clean shimmering high end sweeps, or throaty, vocal classic wah sounds ... the range control allows this to be used with a bass guitar on the lowest setting, which also lends a really off the beaten path "I'm using a bass wha" with my guitar 'whallop' effect.  It's a really fun pedal, because it is  absolutely loaded with features!  The features and dials are pretty straight forward. Spend an hour with this wah and you'll realize you have several different types of classic wah's in one incredibly inexpensive pedal!!  The best part is that it is noiseless - it uses an optical sensor instead of a potentometer -- so good riddance to scratchy, hiss laden garbage in the signal.  The old Crybaby pedal I was using actually picked up am radio broadcast!  I bought this wah in a pinch, because my crybaby pedal is overdue for a pot change-out, and I needed a replacement yesterday, but I couldn't get it to the tech in time -- so I bought this Behringer as a stand in.  I'll still fix the crybaby, but I'm thinking I'll lean on this Behringer wah for a bit yet.  The one major thing that takes some getting used to is the on/bypass feature -- there is no 'toe-forward switch on/bypass'  -- as soon as you touch the pedal, it is on and functioning, which is nice, because you don't have to 'toe-forward' to switch it on or bypass!!  I like that personally and I think it's a great improvement.  BUT ... If you are used to aggressively rocking your wah all the way back -on the default setting, you will notice that the 'heel down' position instantly goes into bypass, and YOU WILL hear a pop!!  There is a delay adjustment that is not obvious but is clearly marked and accessible from the bottom of the pedal ... you can adjust that delay up to two seconds, which allows the pedal to be at full 'heel down' position while playing, and then as soon as you leave it there, it will switch off. I personally like the 'instant on' functionality of this pedal, but it takes learning a little finesse, which is how a wah should actually be used...                
This pedal is loaded with features that pedals costing 8 times as much don't even have!                
I'm giving it an eight, because it takes a slight, very slight learning curve to get used to the way this pedal turns on and off --- we're all so used to 'toe-down' to switch on and off.  If you use the default settings, you simply cannot rock it all the way back without hearing it go in and out of bypass mode . if you use just a little care and finesse, the instant on/off feature will make you wonder why vox and crybaby pedals never evolved ...                 
I really should give an eight, but folks that know behringer pedals know that they use industrial grade plastic instead of metal.  As far as effects pedals made these days go, time will tell... my 'vintage' crybaby wah is mostly pot metal, I could crack it with a ball ping hammer -- the same blow might shatter or bounce off the housing of this Behringer pedal--I don't know haven't tried either .. they hold up just as good as all the other pedals with normal use.                
The absolute bang for the buck!!  It doesn't get much better.  If you don't mind being a pioneer, ignoring all the clap-trap about what vintage pedal this or that guitar god recorded with; back in the day, that was all there was, there wasn't an option -- Behringer just threw it out there, rockstar style!!  Finally, a reliable wah, that you don't have to wince every time you go to step on it wondering what kind of sound you're going to get.                
Haven't had to call them, ever.  And I have mixers, amps, microphones and now effects pedals that haven't given me the slightest problem -- so not having to have contacted customer support ever deserves a 9!                
It's sexy, because it works with no frills and it doesn't come with all the quirks and noise, and constant replacing of pots that the vox and crybaby pedals have.  This is gonna be my wah for a good while yet!!!                  
When the pedal is fully pressed down it gives more of a "rock" sound, sometimes i just play music with the pedal pushed down because the sound quality is better.                
there are different settings, dials, and overdrive                
very easy to use. no trouble setting up or using                
very well made. heavy construction and strong material.                
low price great quality                
Shipping was extremely fast. i was fully satisfied with delivery.                
The pedal itself is a beginner, "must have" sort of thing. Great for beginers                
I belive this product will last years, and keep me rockin on and on                
yeah sounds gud cause i can use it on bass playing and many types of music... i can adjust also the delay of the wah.... i can make fading on the time when i turn on/off the wah....
i can make a very high pitched sound in a slow attacking mode eventhough i dont use s.attack                
there are 3 diff. features in this wah that u can't find with others...
1. boost... u can set the main volume from the wah when ur using it
2. time delay... u can set time or i mean delays on turning it on/off in slower manner or in fastest way
3. range....  u can use it on BASS.... and u can make a very very hi pitch so that u can make ur guitar to cry easily
4. mechanism the spring....it has a spring mechanism which u can also adjust its tension...                
its very handy unlike other wah because it has 9v battery compartment and u can either use the adaptor if u want                
gud quality very eunique style                
very affordable unlike demon wah, morley and cry baby pedal                
yeah they are very friendly and honest especially the behringer people                
i like all of its features                
just buy it and im sure u will not reget                
i would most probly gig with it ................but would not use it for recording ........best thing about this pedal is that u can change the sound/tone .......from muddy to clean babe kills it. another thing if u use a dis pedal its sound differers if u use it before oe after the pedal a lot .................so it depends ............sounds best with out any other pedal.just the babe and the amp .............                 
best thing is the spring back................variation of sound..
and its really friking cheap                
if u have a brin u would know how 2 use it ..........dont worry                 
ahh its preety good.............but if u compare it to a crybaby you would just feel bad ......                
price is the best ever                
never used it ............                
black is black u know but its like plastic with rubber all over it...........so that aint cool .............. looks great .....                
i like it                 
This wah pedal is okay for 30 bucks. Its hard to get a decent wah sound out of it becaue when you step on the pedal it increased the volume so much. If you use reverb with it it sounds okay.                
its a wah pedal                
Easy to use, difficult to get a good sound                
it hasnt broken yet                
dunno                
The sound is Ok. Better after adjusting the settings to my liking. It tone sucks a bit, even when bypassed unless you use high grade cables. Also, be sure not cross audio cables over power cables.                
The boost feature is awesome, just not before the pre-amp input. Put the wah in the FX loop after your gain stages and it will be awesome.                
Instant off rocks and has already changed the way I play certain songs (all for the better). I can slam a unison "wah" note outta nowhere and continue as if nothing strange has happened. The band loves the new places I can input surprises.                
Plastic shell, although it's very heavy. You need to place this pedal just right of your pedal board to make use of the side boost switch. Perhaps the boost switch should have a 1/4" input so you can use an independent switch to activate it.                
Best wah for under $100. Rocktron Black Cat may be better but I haven't tried it yet.                
I own many Behringer units and have asked them for way too much info on every unti and they always deliver. I ask for schematics and mmc commands for each unit and they deliver every time but.....I've never had a device fail so I don't know about support for failures.                
Saving money allows me to buy flowers for "HER" and I feel sexier. But, my wah whines better, sounds better and never accuses me of cheating on her!!                
Best bang for buck!!!!                
The sound was spectacular even before i found my 'signature' tone.
it very sounds classic rock with the gain low. With it higher it sounds modern hard rock. I pair this with a overdrive and get an amazing paul gilbert tone.                 
The gain boost really pulls the distortion together to give it a crunchier tone. The bottom boost also helps add more punch to it.                
Very easy to use. I set up my tone in less than an hour.                
Even though its made of plastic, it is very sturdy and won't give in even under gig situations.                
The best value for a shredders or classic rockers tone.                
I have not had to use them.                
its actually a different color than you would think. I don't want to spoil it. :)                
I expect to use this until it breaks from heavy gigs. then i will buy another one.                
OK, so it's housed in plastic. But unless you're going to drop it from a bridge onto concrete, it'll do the job and stay intact under nomal use, incluidng gigging. For the price, you can buy two and keep one as a spare in your kit. Soundwise, it's amazing and the sustain is unbelievable...without harsh compression involved. This is supposedly a copy of a Boss pedal. The pots on this thing have a nice feel to them, some resistence in turning that makes them feel durable. Altogether, a nice pedal that delivers what it promises: heavy distortion and a lot of control over the tone and color of the sound. The only drawback is getting the top of the pedal off to replace a battery. But if you're going to daisychain it into your board, this is not an issue.                
When comparing  the HD400 to the Ebtech Hum eliminators, this one is the clear winner. The Ebtech cuts the audio signal volume and takes out the highs so badly that I would rather deal with the hum! This unit does a VERY good job at trying to ensure the the audio signal coming in is the same quality and tone as the processed audio signal going out.                
There really aren't any extra features. I wish they had an 8-way rack mountable model.                
No settings required. Just plug it in and you're ready to go.                
Excellent quality.                 
These seem to be cheaper than the competitor.                 
Have not needed to called support. I guess that is a good thing.                
It looks nice. However, when you have 4 or more of these units wired up next to each other, they don't really stack well. Outer surface is slick.                
This unit does the best job at eliminating hum without harming the quality of the signal. Wish they had a rack mountable unit like the ebtech 8 channel.                
Was successful in doing what it is supposed to do.                
Funny. Last year I paid $19.95 for the product. This year it is $29.95. I guess they figured it is worth more since it really works.                
Totally eliminated the hum...and my application is sort of non-standard.  I haven't a CRT monitor and I do a lot of recording.  Well these put out a very large EM field and will caused your pick-ups to pick up a lot of hum...this thing did the trick.                
One feature...it gets rid of the hum, what else do you want?                
Just plug it in and it works.                
It a little tin box....I wouldn't go dropping it on the floor, but I'd say it would survive.                
Half the cost of the others, and it delivers.                
Not on this product, but Behringer make good cheap products.  I own their DUALFEX Pro & PowerPlay Pro.                
It's a box...how sexy can it be?                
Perfect for the application, made good on its promises and solved the hum.                
This little bastard actually works. My sound had a decent amount of AC Hum and this got rid of it ALL. I forget when my damn amp is on now because its so quiet.                
Its 2 channel, 20 bucks, what more do you want?                
Plug in and go.                
Rugged. This is definitely road worthy.                
$20 for no noise...you NEED this.                
I couldn't record without it anymore.                
I am very satisfied with this, I won't be looking for anything else. It kills the noise and doesn't touch my sound.                
This is an affordable isolation unit that will often (but not always) reduce hum.                 
Basic unit, but nice that it has 2 channels.                
plug in cables and go... how easy is that?                
Metal body but lightly built. I would not want to leave this on stage where it might get stepped on.                 
Good value for the price. Does the same job as other units 2x as expensive.                
Overall, this is good value and everyone should probably have one handy. But, it will not solve all hum problems! Really tough cases will require  something like a EHX Humdebugger --but those are more expensive and do affect your sound quality.                
initially it worked fine, it got rid of the static coming from all my ac adapter(don't own a daisy chain). it didn't seem to kill the tone and left things sounding different, but in a good way.                
kills noise, the end.                
plug in, plug out, no power supply needed, completely passive, couldn't ask for more.                
worked fine, but after LITERALLY 3 days it's beginning to make a lot of unwanted buzz.                 
20 bucks, worth it, maybe you'll have better luck thaan me.                
haven't bothered.                
works nice, good price, people should at least try it.                
i wished it didn't crap out on me so quickly, i was getting excited.                
WOW. I have several pairs of low-end professional headphones, and none of them come close to this. As professional as anyone needs. Unless you work in a studio or have money to blow, the sound from these is more than perfect.                
I wish they weren't so loose, and the slider locked in place better. They just don't feel like they are going to stay on my head (but they do).
Best feature on these is the 3.5 adapter it comes with. The larger plug just unscrews, revealing the 3.5 plug, so there is no 3-inch long bulky adapter to deal with when you need to plug it into an amp or computer.                
Fit could be better, but for the price, these are heaven-sent on every other level. Obviously Behringer's low-end, but still higher than most.                
I am just starting a home studio, and if you are doing the same, DO NOT buy anything more expensive than these. They will do everything you need.                
Light-weight plastic construction, unobtrusive adjusting mechanism.                
I was pretty impressed with the sound, very true to the music.  It didn't blow me away, but why spend more if you aren't picky?                
I wish it was 1/8" adaptable to 1/4". It's only 1/4".                
Very impressive construction! Looks are really nice, materials very sturdy.                
GREAT VALUE! These are like, 40$ headphones by my reckoning.                
Looks are very intimidating ;).                
Great product, although the fit on my head was a little wierd, theres a gap between the ear pads and my under-ear.                
Nice flat; not overbassed sound                
Extra pair of slipers would make it 10!                
Pluig it in!!                
Right for price                
Only if I did not ship UPS... different story...                
N/A                
got 4 pairs...                
$$ + quality + sound = 10                
It all depends on what you are listening to and how the sound is mixed. You might add a headphone amp. They sound great!                
It has a 1/4 inch jack and a regular 3.5 jack so yeah...there ya go.                
Just unscrew the 1/4 inch jack to get to the regular one. This is pretty much the only thing you have to figure out about these.                
Very nice!                
You won't find a better set for 16 bucks.                
I saw these on here and was like,"what,16 bucks?" As professional as 16 dollars can buy!                
Overall great for listening but if you are a drummer buy some of those  extreme isolation headphones.                
very good sound, especially for the price
not the greatest, but definitely better than 16$ worth of sound                 
the cable is a decent length, it is probably around 6ft, havent measured
the plug is thick, which is good
it comes with a screw-on 1/4th inch adapter.  the ups about this is that it feels more like there is no adapter when it is screwed on 
the down of this is, it cant be used on other 1/8th inch cables without them having screws on it
its a trs cable if anyone was wondering, not a ts                
very easy to use, except for maybe unscrewing the adapter                
this is probably the only thing im disappointed with
it has cheap plasitc connecting the top to the ear cup, probably going to break easily, and is not very sturdy so be careful
one of the ear cups is slightly slanted on mine                
worth it!!! IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY, a really good way to get those studio headphones when you are just starting out and dont want to dish out too much cash                
N/A                
not exactly the sexiest product but the feel of the cushion ontop is decent                
it was definitely worth the money, a very good value
its a good starter headphone and you should work your way up to more sturdy headphones for those long mixing sessions
it is worth the money, actually more in my opinion                
They sound pretty good to me.  Easily the best sounding $10 headphones anywhere.                 
Pros - 1/8" plug and 1/4" adapter, decent length on the chord
Cons - The cans don't pivot and it is a bit snug on my melon.                  
Plug it in and put it on.  It doesn't get much easier.                  
Quality is good for headphones, phenomenal for ten bucks.                  
Ten clams!  Kick a$$ product for the moolah.                
Haven't needed it.  For ten bucks, I'll buy another pair rather than go through warranty processes.                
Of course, I'd prefer a top-shelf set of phones, but again . . . ten bucks!!!!                
I'll probably buy a couple spares because the value is great.                
excellent sound and durability....if your a dj then you probably go thru headphones like records...but not with these.                
has what every phones have                
if you cant figure these out you shouldnt be holding them                
very durable inside and out                
the best for the money even for $50                
havent dealt with them                
proffessional looking                
its a great product for behringer                
Sound quality isn't good, but I was just looking for something cheap that I can throw on so I won't totally disturb my family.                
It's Behringer....Like  I said, I just needed something CHEAP!!!!!  They don't really fit very snug, but then again...only $10...what do you expect?                 
I think they're worth $10....I don't mix with them, but I wouldn't mix with headphones anyway.                
They look alright I guess                
Sound is not great...but I use them to CHECK my mixes (lowest common denominator).  They don't fit good either...SO WHAT!!!!  They're 10 Bucks!!!!                
I was skeptic at first.. you get what you pay for right?   I bought a couple for throw away studio headphones.. but they work actually pretty good.  A lil on the low end but for $10 you really cant get any better, that I'v found yet!  They can take a high output and high end doesn't crack. Great for when you need multi headphones really fast.
They offer resonably good sound quality, although I don't find the bass to be so clear, and highs don't have a big presence.                
The headphones came with a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter for hooking the cans up to both a mixing board and consumer electronics.
My head is somewhat long (or tall), so the adjustable headband does really help that much, as I keep it fully extended.                
Easy enough to put on and slip off.
Eye glass wearers should not that the pads compress the temples of the frames, which quickly gets uncomfortable.
In general, the top and bottom of the ear pads will kind of stick in to the wearer's head, which also becomes uncomfortable rapidly.                
95% of the set is plastic, although it doesn't feel cheap asto fall apart. Just don't toss them in a bag with other heavy items, and they'll probably last a while.                
Might as well spend a bit more cash and get something more comfortable.                
Never needed it.                
These headphones are resonably uncomfortable, but are good enough for simple use.                
These headphones are great for a tight budget but you get what you pay. the quality is muffled but you get used to it. I would suggest something a little better even if your on a tight budget. They kind of hurt my head too. nice long cable though. Good value but not good headphones                
long cable                
These phones sounds really "dead" compared to my HPS3000's or my AKG K240's or even my Panasonic RP-HT21's (not at all the same kind of headphone, I know). They may claim to have a very flat frequency response, but I don't believe it - the highs and lows are both dead-sounding and I get all mid. Everything sounds muddy in these headphones, even when it sounds crisp on my studio monitors or in my K240's.                
I like the gold-plated dual-purpose plug. Very nice. They are decently comfortable, but not as comfortable as my HPS3000's. They isolate sound decently, but they don't sit flat against my head, which would make them be more isolative.                
I have to play with the EQ to make these listenable.                
For the price, they have the quality I would expect, except for the gold plated dual purpose plug, which I would not expect at this prince point.                
One cannot complain about a pair of $14 headphones when they will serve their intended purpose just fine, which is for studio monitors to wear while recording tracks. I don't need stellar sound quality for that.                
I have no idea. I'd rather buy another pair than deal with any sort of support for this price. They're basically free.                
They're headphones. They work. They don't sound that good. Whatever.                
I will use these until I blow them, which might be forever. I will definitely not mix with them, however.                
The sound of this product is not stellar or is it run of the mill. The description of multipurpose is modest, in that the sound is almost tinny, But i guess for the price they are adequate. But i also own Philips HS500 Behind the Head Sport Lightweight Headphone and they put out a much better quality sound and they were only ten dollars too. So don't buy these headphones for the sound.                
The actual construction of the headphones was superb for the price and the closed ear were excellent.                
Durability and look are high, but the sound leave something to be desired. There are wierd rubber pads just beetween the R and L on each side.                
About the only closed ear headphone for $10.                
Don't know hope i dont have too.                
Kind of funky looking ear cover but overall a sleek looking product for the price.                
I was kind of disatisfied by this product because of the sound but if you want a closed ear headphone for cheap get these.                
Much better than my $100 Sony headphones! These things are a steal. Don't let the low cost fool you.                 
they are very comfortable!!                
Awesome!                
Unreal!                
I own a Behringer mixer and love it. When I read about these headphones I had to have a pair. Just because I knew that they would sound great and I was not disappointed!                 
I'll be satisfied with these headphones for years and plan on buying the dj set.                 
Seems just a tad bit lacking in the bass department.  But they sound better then many of the headphones I've bought at Wal-Mart etc.                
As mentioned, they don't really swivel around any.  While that probably means they are more durable then swivels. (Most of the swivels I've had have broken in the swivel part.)  They can be a bit uncomfortable.  But they fit right over the entire ear which is nice.  
Has the cord connected only on the left side of the headphones.  That's something I always liked in headphones.  They are usually easier to work with that way.                
Seem to be well made.  Mostly made of plastic it seems but definitely not as cheaply made as some headphones I've seen.                
They are worth what you pay for them..  I wouldn't buy them if they where much more expensive though.                
I've never had to deal with the company,                
They look quite nice.  They are silver and black.  But I buy headphones for how they sound and feel not so much how they look.  (I can't see them if they are on my head anyways.)                
Compared to a pair I tried on in a store once these are horribly uncomfortable.  But they are more comfortable then most I've tried.  I would probably buy Sony headphones if I could find them to replace these.                
For a new DJ or someone who doesn't mind a 1/4 jack for there all day use, its a steal and I would recommend all products from them great set.                
no accersories but to be expected by headphones                
Sound was terrible.  Period.                
The earpieces have no swivel to them, in any dimension or direction, so if your ears happen to be in the right place when you spread these junkers open, great, but if not, you're out of luck.                
OK quality, but a terrible product!                
Poor value.  $10 down the drain.                
Not sexy.  Not cool.  Embarrassingly bad product.  Don't be seen with it.                
Sound is kool if you are not trying to mix with them. not as accurate. kinda of bassy. play a song you like through monitors and then listen with these...watch how many instruments and highs disappear.                
1/4 plug is kool.                
plastic. had to give this a 3. THese things worked fine for like a year until I went downstairs while listening to my MP3 player with them and the cord got a little cought on the door knob on the way to the basement. One little snugg of the cord cause the left side to go completely out. I could not believe it. So I could just image if I had a traffic heavy studio with crazy artist using my headphones. They definately would not have lasted. Mine only lasted a year because I only used them every blue moon to track dubbs on some vox.                
good price. I paid 9.99 for mine.                
no need                
dont want it any more. would not by another pair because that small pull caused them not to work anymore.                 
Have to give it a 5 overall. if they worked, i'd give them a 6 sonically.                
Sound good and feel good. You need a head phone amp, low tones will blow these cheap cans out in no time.                
No . Shoud offer a low price amp.Behringer is not a top line product.
It is not if it will break, it is when it will break.                
Simple pluge them in and stick them on your head, any tard can do it.                
Today things are thrown together and thrown out.                
Not bad for the money. My friend is on his second set in 15 weeks.                
They can't help for $ 16.00. No one cares.                
Sex appeal to head phones? A sick thing to ask.                
Satisfied till they start to buzz.                
THE SOUND IS JUST PERFECT  ,, not too bassy / or too brite to fatige your ears after a few hours of playing music ,if you want it loudder or more bassy and briter just crank your mixer to your ears needs and you tell me how your ears will feel after a few hours in the studio                 
the sound is flat and natural and  when i needed to change frequencies on my mixes ,Not a Problem                 
the extendable ear cups are great including the thick soft ear padding you don't need swivel cups, and helps to reduce outside noise , the 1/4" plug is better than the removable tip some headphones have except the screw on type models, we use them almost every day and pull and trip on the wire an drop on floor but guest what ,, still working just like my more expensive headphones                
for this price 3 month ago I ordered 2 just to compare , we try them and later ordered 6 more,today I'm ordering 4 more, go for it                
dont need it                
The silver and black body outstand compared to my all black headphones
the pull in out ear cups , the soft ear cushions , the 1/4" plug is a good design                 
I have many other headphones some are very loud/or too bassy / or too bright ,,,but do you own a pair of professional studio monitors do you know their sound is natural- not like your home sound speaker- can you hear the difference- well dont expect this headphones to sound too brite or too bassy, they sound flat natural for semi professional musical needs, dont compare this with walkman headphones                 
Mushy bass, serious lack of mid and highs. Way too much bass pressure causesall the mids and highs to be lost. I would not recommend these, unless you cannot afford anything else.                
It makes sound, but it is so untrue to life it is sad.  The bass is loud and middy, the highs sound like a poorly boosted EQ, harsh and crisp.  They do not aid in accurate reference at all.                
Includes a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter.  No carrying bag, nothing.                
Plug em in, put them on.                
Light and cheap, feel fake... feel like they could break just sitting on your head.  One small drop could probably be the end of these.  
They do not adjust to your head very well so there is often a gap some place when wearing them unless your head if their perfect shape.
Save the planet and save your money.  Do not support any company that sells such a poor product at any price.  Do not be fooled by some reviews here claiming these are decent studio/music headphones.  They are not even close.  You can get into that range for about $60-70, but even then your still not in the pro series.                
Never used it                
I regret wasting money on them.                
I cannot imagine how they could have touted/advertised these headphone worse.  They are really bad.  Please heed the warnings.                
These get a 10 out 10 in the bang for the BUCK!  Once again Behringer does it again.  You can't match their quality at the price they charge.
You will not find a better pair of headphones under $50.  We'll maybe
a few but you'll be spent just looking for em.                  
The plastic shell is cool and should hold up with normal use and a lil care.                   
Sound seems fine for djing and listening.                
Best feature is that they haven't broken yet.  They are sturdy and both earphones have worked for over a year.                
Definitely nothing to write home about, but it's better than expected for the price.                
Right side went out after a day and the left shortly after. Very disappointing.                
They sound like $18 dollar headphones so dont expect much                
The only cool feature about these headphoens is the cushion on top of your head                
After a week of use, one earphone gave up on me, it just stopped putting out sound, and the other earphone the bass is all distorted now. I wouldnt recommend these headphones for Dj's its cheap and cheap looking, and cheap sound.                 
These headphones sounds pretty good, the bass hits right on , plenty of treble and mids.                
No swivel on the phones, and they dont extend that much.                
I paid 17.88 for mine so i expected nothing fancy                
For 17.88 these headphones sounds great, i would compare them to $50-80 headphones                 
Overall if your a Dj these headphones dont have many features, like adjusting them to your desire. The cups arent that puffy and spongy, and the top head support is a little stiff. For 17.88 these are great headphones, Will upgrade later when I make a little more money                
It's a full sound. Some say too bassy, some say not enough, sounds fine to me but my ears are reference recording ears. It's better than many I've tried for much higher price, although the definition isn't comparable to a Sony MDR $200 pair. For the price they're great.                
They work, that's good enough for me. And the price makes it excellent. No real features, but I don't need anything special for monitoring while I'm singing.                
Put 'em on use 'em. 'Nuff said.                
Still got them after 1 year, so no problem. I use while dubbing vocals and my clients like them too.                
For $10.....say no more. For $17 (latest price) still worth it.                
No experience.                
Sex appeal?.......Do you also vote for the candidate with the brightest teeth? Sorry, a dumb question for a Capricorn, or anyone else actually. It's practical and works well for my applications.                
I would buy another 1 or 2 and probably will.                
Pretty comparable to other pairs around $30 and under. If you need a cheap reference pair, these are nice and cheap.                
Only comes with a 1/4 inch plug. Kind of a pain you'll have to buy a 1/4 to .35mm converter to use with the most common .35mm plug.                
Headphones, how hard can they be?                
For $10 they are actually pretty well built.                
Great pair for the money.                
Have not had to deal with them.                
Some people say they look like a toy, I think the sliver looks sharp.                
Great pair of headphones if your looking in the $40 or under range. Doesn't compare to my $100 Sony MVR set, but these are a steal for $10.                
I use these so that the people I'm recording can hear themselves, so sound quality did not matter too much to me. Which is ok, because these are not amazing sound quality. They're better than any 10 dollar headphones I've heard.                
Absolutely THE WORST adjusting to my head. They are very uncomfortable and there is nothing to do about the discomfort. People have written that you need an average size head and they are wrong, you need a head shaped like a square for these things to fit right.  ALSO the set didnt come with a 1/4 inch adapter! Annoying!                
plug in                
The adjusting pieces DO NOT WORK on ANY of the 4 sets I ordered.                
when i ordered them i thought it was amaizng that a headset like this was for sale for 10 dollars, but then after getting them i understood why they were so cheap. Still good for the price tho, not great.                
Duno                
They look amateur.                
I'm just starting up a small studio to record a couple local bands for cheap so it was nice to get headphones for so cheap so i could spend more money on mics. I bought these knowing that they didnt matter too much so it was nice. DO NOT buy them for casual listening because they are not comfortable enough. I'm wearing them right now and my head kinda hurts.                
I read all the reviews here, and was expecting to be surprised by the value of these headphones.  They're supposed to sound as good as $50 headphones and by some reviews even as good as the $200.  THEY SOUND LIKE $10 HEADPHONES.                
Very limited adjustment.  Make sure your head is AVERAGE sized.                
Cheap plastic.                
$10 is what you get, that's fair.                
They look pretty nice from a distance.                
Don't get these as studio monitor headphones, they'll disappoint you.  And if you're looking for iPod phones, go for something with better BASS.                
the sound i get out of these is equal to/ better then the sound i get out of my behringer monitors, sounds clear enough, not to trebly or bassy.                
these are are alot bigger in person,they fit comfortably but there kinda cheap,goofy,amateurish looking                
perfecto                
the price is rite for light jamming and recording when my folks dont want to hear                 
!!!!                
dunno                
bang for your buck, wooptydoo!                
Low quality headphones. Not suitable for recording or mixing.                
No accessories. Average sized cable.                
Not very adjustable. Don't fit too well.                
Decent Support.                
Good looking phones.                
These headphones sound colored to me. Something about the midrange doesn't sound natural. I gave them some time to break in, but they didn't improve. I'm not impressed. I'm comparing it to headphones by sennheiser, audio technica, and bose, all of which are much more expensive.                
Of course the $10 price doesn't allow them to include much. It does have a padded headband and single side cord, but that's about the end of the features. Notably, the ear cups do not swivel at all and did not fit my head very well.                
For the price, they seem fairly well made. But then if they don't sound good, who cares?                
They're cheap, but they're uncomfortable and don't sound very good. That's not a good value at any price.                
I don't want them. Does anybody want to buy mine?                
I don't recommend them. They are uncomfortable because the ear cups don't swivel, and the something seems off about the midrange.                
As a flat reference for recording, these totally do the job.  I'm amazed with how good a $10 pair of headphones Behringer made.  For $10 studio headphones and home recording purposes, you can't beat this.  For recording purposes, they actually sound better than some of my other $50 - $200 AKG and Sony headphones.                
The headphone adjustment/fit could be better.  It's kinda like your head fits in them or it doesn't.                
Feel adequate for $10.  Maybe a little too much plastic and not enough strength, but the parts used seem to be of decent quality.                
For $10 studio headphones and home recording purposes, you can't beat this.  For recording purposes, they actually sound better than some of my other $50 - $200 AKG and Sony headphones.                
Never dealt with 'em.                
Could swivel and fit better, but, again, for $10, they're great.                
Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
Yes, and infact Ilove it's interior.                 
The headphones give u a feel of warmth and they let you hear your sound if your doing what u think your doing.                
I think the price is perfect.It's the best price on headphones I'v seen online.                
I like the fact that they look brand new. The fact that there big is a good useful accessorie.                
I needed a good quality pair of studio headphones for home studio recording that wouldn't break the bank. These fit the bill! Are there better out there? Yes. And those cost more. I use those other brands in the actual recording studios. These are good enough for home recording demos. I like the sound quality and they fit snug on my head.                
The sound isn't too bad for the cost of this product. There's a deep bass & the highs are there, the midrange sounds a little buried. I bought 2 pairs of these for my home studio. I also purchased a set of Shure 440 studio headphones at the same time. I was able to A/B them & compare their sound listening to a music cd in-store. OK, the Shure set is superior,brighter & flatter sounding & less bassy, ..but the 440's are also much more expensive. For the money the 3000's will do the job. Buying multiple sets of headphones can get pretty expensive...& what if they break?                   
This product comes with a gold plated 1/4 Jack which screws onto the mini.                
I haven't used it for recording yet - but I think these could be good for drummers, bass players (it has much deeper bass than the Shure) & for background vocalists applications.                
The build quality on these seems pretty good, Behringer has a knack for offering a lot at a decent price.                
This was the least expensive set of "Studio" headphones I've ever seen, at the price, it's hard to go wrong, especially if you need a few sets of headphones -- & if they break, well no big deal! They sound better than some other headphones in the price range.                
I've never had to contact Behringer for a replacement product, so I don't know how they are to deal with.                
If you're just starting out & can't afford multiple sets of $100, $200, $300 + headphones, consider these as being decent extras you can pull out  - If you only buy one set of headphones, I'd personally opt for something a little higher in quality...but if all you can afford is $25, these will get you started & I think you'll be pleased, they are also pretty good for listening to music on a home stereo.                
A decent headset for the price point. If you're trying to mix a full production... etc.... dont buy these.                 
These are muddy and muffled, not crisp at all. spend your money on a used pair of AKG's, you'll thank me later!                
high quality? please they are ok atfirst but i have'nt even had them for a month and the right side has went out all i can say about these head phones are you get what you pay for!!!!!!!                
I have those for a lil over 7 months n I only used them twice... Mannnn they sound awful.. My iPod headphones sound 10 times better than those.. They just big for nothing..                
I like the sound for mixingThe cord could be longer & the earphones a bit larger                
These headphones sound great, but they cannot stand to be played loud for any period of time. The right ear is already shorting out, and I've had this pair of headphone for about 1 month.                
Behringer is well-known for bad quality. But usually I don't much trust to the popular belief. Especially because things tend to change over time. However, as it turned out, not in their case.
So, we have a black plastic box with some inputs and outputs, quite bulky, but the iPad in it perfectly charging (wow!) and has protection against accidental disconnection as could happen with the camera connection kit. Synchronization via midi is stable and it supports SysEx - should pay tribute, the device has no worthy competitors at the moment.
But all those shiny benefits defaced by one, not noticeable at first glance detail - unhealthy digital crackling in specific apps.
Behringer iStudio iS202 produces obscene crackling from all of its outputs in most applications where external input is used. Quite shamelessly exudes sonic artifacts in Audiobus, JamUp Pro, Amplitube, Sugar Bytes Turnado, Live Fx, Yellofier, Samplr ... and I'm sure the list of applications is not limited. And this is not just a clipping problem - this crackling audible at the most quiet signal, as well as its complete absence in the input. I was going to use the iPad mainly as an fx-processor, but in this case this is impossible. That noise is also well noticeable in Animoog when notes fade.
I don't know what it is - poorly designed construction, cheap low-quality components, the problem of firmware or all in one. But nothing like this has happened with the iPad itself, nor with other interfaces connected via camera connection kit.
Support tried to assure me that this problem is not common to all devices, and recommended to make the replacement. It's hard to believe after I swapped 3(!) units and each of them had the same problem.
As a result - the time spent on correspondence with tech support, trips to the store for replacement, wasted money and absolute frustration.
For myself I've decided not to deal with Behringer anymore, but I still recommend iStudio iS202 if you have nowhere to put $150 or suddenly need to buy an artsy charger for iPad.                 
It has crackling background noise problem in many apps  - Jamup Pro, Fender amplitube, LiveFx, Turnado,  Samplr, Tape, Audiobus. Bought this to use as a realtime  effects processor, but with such a situation it is not possible                
I snagged one of these in the first round.  I have a lot of things going on right now but my first impression on first tinkering was that I might return it.  HOWEVER... I got a chance to tinker again the other night and I'm happy to say that I am very satisfied with the iStudio now.  I have been mostly using it with Multitrack DAW and there was a bit of a learning curve.  It works well.  You can plug a large diaphragm condenser mic into input one (and power it) a guitar into input two and record or play along with tracks simultaneously.  I'm diggin it.  I would love to try it with Auria but I haven't purchased that app yet.                
What a AWSOME portable daw docking station. It's what you need for on the fly recording. Works great for all you needs. Has lots of option.                
I purchased this because despite some 70/30 reviews on Behringer, I purchased a 24!track mixer a year ago and have been pretty satisfied with it. After approx two weeks, the contact between the iPad and iStudio became unreliable....and a week later, quit working all together. Tried two other people's iPads, and they didn't work either. Going to replace it with the Focusrite                
These go great with the behringer k8...these helped my mixs big time! If u got the k8s or k6. Get this now...and with the 4 easy payments its simple                
sounds big for a small amp. as long as you do't get to loud.                
What other features would you need? The amp has them all.  At this price to have a 5 band EQ and a digital FX is awesome.                
What do you need to figure out? It's a strait forward amp.                
It gets an 7 here, not because of the case, which is beefy, but the knobs.  The knobs have long plastic shafts and are asking to be broken. They should have made them shorter.                  
For the price it can't be beat.                
Dont know.                
I own it.                
I bought this amp to do small gigs, rehursals, jams, etc.  The key word is small.  It is small and light with a big sound.  The volume wont blow you over (45 watts) but that is not what this amp is about.
The FX are a bonus that I would never expect at this price. Remember when a FX processor like this was $400?                
Clear and uncolored running an iPod an a bass through it.  Plenty of volume available.                
Three channels (0ne XLR capable) plus a "CD" input, a sub-woofer output as well as a line out, EQ with feedback detection and so much more for $140.  This thing is loaded for the money and seems to do everything well.                
Excellent for so much stuff being stuffed in one small box.                
It looks good and is nicely finished.  I haven't had it long enough to rate durability, but other Behringer amps I've seen were plenty tough.                
It is $100 less than units from other manufacturers that do less and sound no better.                
No experience with problmes, but the info avialable on their website is pretty good.                
It's an amp in basic black, but the feature set for the price is outstanding.  Flexibility of what you can plug into it is a plus as well.                
Good, flexible, transportable sound at a good price.  Another vendor would have to add features and drop prices to get me to consider them.                
THE SOUND OF THIS AMPLIFIER IS AWESOME, IT HAS A GOOD SOUND QUALITY ESPECIALLY IF YOU CONNECT IT TO A PREMIUM ORGAN OR KEYBOARD, IT HAS DEFINITELY HELPED ME TO FIND THE SOUND THAT IM LOOKING FOR, IM USING IT TO CONNECT TO HAMMOND XK3C AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A LESLIE SPEAKER!!! I LIKE THE EQUALIZER EFFECTS AS YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THE SOUND OUTPUT THAT YOU THINK ITS BEST. FOR THE LOW PRICE, THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME.                
IT INCLUDES POWER AC CORD, THE MOST USEFUL FEATURES ARE THE EQUALIZER SETTINGS AND THE REVERB. ITS VERY USEFUL IF YOU HAVE A KEYBOARD THAT DOESNT HAVE EFFECTS.                
THIS PRODUCT IS SO EASY TO USE, THE HOOK UP IS SO EASY TO SET UP. AND YOU CAN MODIFY YOUR SOUND JUST BY ADJUSTING THE SLIDER FOR EQUALIZER AND REVERB.                
THE PRODUCT HAS A VERY GOOD DESIGN AND BODY, IT HAS COVERED WITH CARPET STYLE MATERIAL AND THE HANDLE IS SO DURABLE, YOU CAN EASILY PUT IT IN YOUR CAR FOR SPECIAL OCCASSIONS OR TO PERFORM IN VARIOUS PLACES.                
THE PRICE IS SO LOW COMPARE TO OTHER KEYBOARD AMPLIFIER, BUT THE FEATURE IS SO GREAT YOU WOULNT BELIEVE YOU CAN GET IT IN A LOWER PRICE.                
I HAVENT TRIED CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPPORT SO FAR                
ITS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST MUSIC PRODUCT, MUSICIANS WILL LOVE IT, THE LOOK IS SO PROFESSIONAL, ITS A NICE ADDITION TO YOUR MUSIC INVENTORY.                 
I'LL KEEP IT AND USE IT TILL ITS WORKING PROPERLY, I'LL DEFINITELY BUY THE SAME PRODUCT JUST INCASE I NEED TO BUY ONE, THE PRICE AND FEATURE WILL DEFINITELY MOTIVATE YOU TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT, ITS DEFINITELY WILL HELPED YOU TO MEET YOUR MUSIC NEEDS.                
I pluged my guitar into this amp just for kicks and was surprised seeing i bought it for my drum kit it sounded better than my line 6 guitar amp it has that beutiful tube sound its fun just playing it straight even without effects but of coarse the effects are great too amazing for what i paid                
very easy lots of features                
easy to use                
built like a tank                
for the money its a steal                
havent used them                
this has great sound it hits the highs and lows vary well. its just at high vol. the lows are a little distorted                
it came with a power cord... that is about it. it has 100 diffrent FXs, a nice eq                
the controls are easy. altho u can't use the FXs on the rca input                
vary durable. when i am puting my equipment in my car i am more woried that my amp will dent my car than my amp breaking                
this is the loudest amp for the price                
this is my first amp... for anything i did get a reanable 2 year warrenty for $20                
its big it has a black carpet out side layer... and its awesome to stand on                
this is a great keyboard amp                
I own this amp!used it all the time,I run itin stereo with another amp.I really love this amp,will purchase another one soon ,real quality, looks and sounds great!no issues at all with thisproduct. behringer got a bad rep earlier,but they got it right! buy this you wont be sorry,IF YOU GET FROM ZZOUNDS.THEY ALSO GET IT RIGHT1

very easy                
looks good,solid amp lacks loud sound quality                
Only delt with music shop where i purchased it they were a bit slow to respond now out of waranty. They told me to try and blow it up so Beringer would replace it, could not blow it up.                 
looks good, average on sound clarity when loud                
great for a practice amp and a quiet jam at home but lacks the clarity for a loud jam,drums etc.                
 i am pleasently surprised at the features as well as the different sounds this unit produces with an acoustic gibson guitar with a dearmond pickup.   amazing                
I play the guitar and use the Roland GR-55 Guitar Synth.  I got this "PA Amp" because a guitar amp could not handle the wide frequency of highs and lows that come from the GR-55 (which has many keyboard sounds, deep basses and screaming high instruments)  I have played live with this unit without the amp being mic(ed) or a line out being used and it performed wonderful.  I bought a pole stand to put it on and that helps the sound get right at hear level (built in whole for pole like PA speakers).  I talk to Roland Keyboard amp owners and the word is that their tweeters break easily and most have switch to the Behringer now.  They have had theirs for some time and have had no problem with it (unlike the more expensive Rolands)  I LOVE THIS THING!
I use this as a mini PA for solo gigs as well as a keyboard amp, acoustic guitar amp and the occasional bass amp (at moderate volumes). It does a fine job with all these applications. When set on the ground I usually have to roll off some low end and all your instruments have to use their own EQ's and pre-amps because this is (other than the low-imp mic input) a line level only device with only a 5-band graphic EQ to shape the overall tone. If you can live with that compromise this makes a fine little swiss-army knife of an amplifier.                
Sounds good, the digital EFX are nothing special but they are quite useable. The reverbs add a lot to the overall sound when used as a mini PA. The speakers seem matched well to the amplifier, all in all a nice package especially for the money.                
Very EZ to use.                
This seems more solid and reliable than some older Behringer equipment I have used. It's not top-line but it doesn't cost like top-line either. All in all a good value.                
Good "bang-for-the-buck" and very versatile.                
Haven't dealt with the company so it's hard to say.                
It's well designed, compact and fairly lightweight. sounds good too.                
Again, good "bang-for-the-buck" and very versatile. I am a little wary about the reputation that Behringer has gotten for much of their stuff but it seems a good value even after 10 months.                
It seems like the best choice for the needs we had in mind. Just a trio playing in small venues for jazz style ambiance music. Has the volume we need for different size crowds. Still working on using the eq but all I can say now is that I'm very content and the only item that I wish it came with is a cover. Have not had to contact the manufacturer.                
I've only used this unit twice, one at practice and one at show. It fulfilled all I needed to get my sound out for my Yamaha 235 keyboard and Fender Stratacaster alongside my bandmates. So far, just what I was looking for.                
I have the k900fx for five years. Works very well. I use it on pole stand with a Behringer 1202fx beside me providing control and effects, Combo works beautifully. Equalizer on amp works well and 1202fx fine tunes everything. Used to amplify my accordion with dynamic mics during solo gigs. Excellent value and when used for my purposes, compares very favorably with other much more expensive amps. Cabinet is very solid. Controls don't seem to be overly rugged but I have not had any problems at all. Never needed manufacturer support which you require!                
Clean, smooth.                
XLR input is nice. Effects are fun, but probably won't be used that much. Haven't had much use for the feedback eliminator yet.                
Plug it in. Turn it up.                
Solid as a rock so far.                
Absolutely.                
Have had no issues yet. Always had good luck / value w/ Bheringer stuff.                
The EQ knobs have little red LED's. That looks pretty cool.                
It's solid. It's clean. So far has plenty of power, but have not taken it onstage.                
I've always considered Behringer the bottom of the food chain, but WOW, wasI surprised by this amp! I bought it for price point but I'm thrilled with the quality. It sounds AWESOME, I love the 3 channels, I can plug in my guitar and vocal and it's as clear as a bell but it also handles my synth, including low notes without distortion                
Not great, peaked at very low volume levels. It does not work for full-band gigs or anything. DONT BUY FOR BAND PRACTICE. Had no other problems besides volume. Figures that the amp that weighs around 50lbs but has nothing worth while inside.                
Sturdy construction Easy to use*make sure you get a speakon cable or 2I outputting into a Marshall cabAnd have had product for A little over a month now And love it. Very clean soundVERY CLEANNo hissing and thats what I wanted\m/And sidenote i have contacted customer support because I noobed on the speakon cables and they guided me through and got me going no problem!                
ok, so I've seen all the mixed reviews with behringer products but I have had nothing but positive results with them. I purchased this from zZounds about a month ago, needed to power a couple of newly acquired speakers and it works perfect. The unit is solid, quite as far as I am concerned and does what its suppose to. I am sure it will provide me with years of service as it should.                 
I bought this to power a 4x12 cab in my home studio. I'm very happy with it and it does what I need it to do. My only nit is that the fan is a bit louder than what I expected. Not a huge issue for me, but may be for others. I just wouldn't place any sensitive mics near it. As far as Behringer customer support, I wouldn't know...never had to contact them on any of my Behringer products, but can't submit review without a rating.                
I recently purchased this amp, from ZZOUNDS.com, and I am totally satisfied.  First off, let me preface my review by admitting that I am NOT a musician.  I know nothing of the intricacies of perfecting music played through amps, mixers, etc...  However, six months ago I purchased a Yamaha DTXplorer electronic drum kit, also from ZZOUNDS, and I have been trying to teach myself how to play(which has been a lifelong dream).  As a 54 year old wannabe-drummer, I finally spent some cash for an amp, the KT-108.  To be succinct, it sounds fabulous!!!  I had tried to play my set through my Pioneer stereo but to be honest, the speakers couldn't handle the low level bass sounds of the drum kit without becoming very distorted.  With the KT-108, voila!  Problem solved!!!  This amp is great for practicing and has been such a blessing for me to be able to get an idea of how I really sound when I am playing.  The CD/mp3 player input is great.  It's nice to be able to play along to songs(or in my case, TRY to play along).  It's also nice to plug in my headphones to the amp, instead of the outlet on my drum module which will help prolong the life of the module.  My kit is very travel-friendly, so I recently took it to the family reunion, on Father's Day.  Both of my brothers play guitar, the older of the two also plays piano, keyboard, bass and a few more instruments; and my brother-in-law is a legitimate, used-to-be-a-musician drummer, so we kinda had a family boogiefest.  I had not purchased my amp yet, so I used my brother's Peavey 50 watt keyboard amp to play the drums.  They sounded good BUT I think that the drums sound much better when played through the KT-108.  Again, that's one man's opinion but it's mine and I am sticking to it.  Keep in mind, I am not going for volume, I just want quality.  I primarily listen to jazz and smooth jazz music, so I don't the need Led Zeppelin window-shattering volume and power.  Having said that, let me again reiterate that this is a high-quality, outstanding amp.  Many thanks to Behringer for a great product and to ZZOUNDS.com for making it available to folks like me!                  
It has 2 instrument inputs, a CD/mp3 player input, adjustable equalizer and a headphone jack.  What else can you ask for?                
Open the box, read the instructions(not really necessary), plug it in and presto! it's music.                
As I stated before, high quality, no reason to believe that this amp won't last longer than me!  Hey, I am 54, so there you go.                  
Again, I have a severely limited experiential level to draw from but for my money this was a great deal.                
The only support that I have used was totally related to registering my product and that was flawless.                
It's a keyboard amp, so how "sexy" can it be?  It is nice looking, well-designed and very utilitarian.  They also sent me an extra "Behringer" sticker, so I made out like a bandit!                
This amp should last me a lifetime, literally.  I have been very diligent in practicing my drums and maybe at some point in the future if I decided to upgrade to a larger kit, I might consider a bigger amp, but I doubt it.  It's just a great amp for what I need, plain and simply put.                
I ordered this as an amp for my Alesis drums. I am very happy with it. I didn't want to spend the amount they wanted for the Alesis amps, so I ordered this. I sounds great and is plenty loud for me to practice my drums at. Zzound was super fast with my order. This was at my house in 4 days after I ordered. Fantastic.                
I have owened several amplifiers from cheap to quite expensive, and what I wanted was a good amp for practice here at home and for when I play for smaller groups.  Before, I had to take two small amplifiers so I could use an instrument, and a mic.  Now with the unbeliveable low priced KT108, I have good sound on the keyboard, even one of the guitars and a microphone.
Zzounds had by far the best price I had seen on this amplifier, I even saw it listed for more than double the price and I would also have to have paid for shipping as well.                
I was super happy to find this amp had a connection for an instrument and the microphone.                
If you can turn a knob, then you can get good sounds from this amplifier.                
I was impressed by the quality of this amp.  It is actually boxed better than my other more expensive amplifiers.  I don't worry about damage to this cabinet, and I'm sure it will be around longer than I will be.                
Yes                
N/A                
I do not rate things for "sex appeal" and lets face it, an amp is an amp                
Until one of us quits playing.  I have no intention to grow in this field, I'm 66 yrs old, my voice is changing, and playing guitar is becoming more painful for me.                
Good amp that faithfully reproduces the sounds of my accordion even though it`s slightly underpowered. To do it over again I`d go for the next size up but the fact is the KT 108 does what it was intended to do. That is , it`s simply a practice amp and for small areas only.                
None but the supplied hard wired cord is just too short.You will need a good extension cord.                
I`ll be looking for a larger amp soon.                
Over all this amp is very good.My problem is within my choice. I'm a new bass guitar player and have found out that I should have order amp with min 40 watts instead of 15 watts. The 15 watts is ok for home and garage playing. But, overall this amp is good.                
Like many E-drummers I found the selection of dedicated drum amps and monitors to be lacking or underpowered...at least how it relates to my particular setup. Originally I bought a Roland CM-220 amp to pair with my drums but was I always either limited by it's underpowered performance or it's lack of additional inputs for my other kit pieces. Doing a little research I knew this time around I either wanted a keyboard amp or a dedicated PA system, both of which seemed to solve the same problems others were having like mine. I almost purchased a Roland KC-880 but really wanted the stereo signal a little wider than being based in one cabinet. I decided on two of these KXD12's based on gobs of reviews and they did not disappoint. They give me just enough control to shape my sound at all power levels and most importantly I have plenty of inputs for my Octapad, SPD-SX and even my sons can jack in to play along with me on guitars and keyboard. Nothing seems to bother these amps. The build quality is outstanding and the sound is amazing!                
I received my keyboard amp 3 days ago, thanks to zZounds "1 day shipping" deal. I've been running my keyboards through Fender amps, which worked O.K. I unpacked the amp, went over the manual (included), and plugged in my 3 keyboards and WOW !!!! The sound is incredible and the equalizer let me customize the highs and lows. ABSOLUTELY ZERO FEEDBACK OR DISTORTION at low or high volume. With 600 watts of power this amp will be able to hold it's own in concert with any Marshall stack! Great deal on 12 pay as available from the crew at zZounds, as usual.                
Clear and powerful, great for any musical style. Works well in any setting from small venues to outdoor festival stages.                
Every feature on this amp is useful and well thought out.                
It's pretty much a no-brainer to use. Just plug and play. The effects are a simple scroll away.                
It's very sturdy, but lighter than a lot of amps this size. It still has some heft and weight to it so don't expect it to be feather weight.                
This amp is well worth the price. Feature for feature and the sound quality make this one you should put at the top of your list.                
I have not had to contact customer support yet.                
It's an all-in-one package that performs the way you would expect any high end product to preform. The sound is extraordinary.                
I've had this amp for a couple of weeks and in that time have used it for rehearsals,live gigs in clubs and two outdoor festivals. It's an amazing amp with plenty of power, extremely easy to use and has a clean, clear tone that everyone notices. For playing jazz, this amp has all the volume you would ever need on it's own. If you are in a rock band or other fully amplified band it has enough punch for most clubs without having to run it through the PA and for those situations where you do need to run it through a sound system it has a direct out and enough power to be heard as your own monitor over the top of any stage monitor mix. It also has amazing projection that shoots your sound out like a shot gun.The effects are terrific and there are plenty of them to choose from if you want to color your sound, but the bread and butter reverbs that you will probably use most are great and easy to dial in for the room. The graphic EQ helps a lot, particularly if you use any outboard pedals that can drain some of your highs or lows.The low price was an added bonus as this amp pretty much blows away anything else on the market unless you want to go with a 1000 watt PA system set-up. I use three keyboards in my set-up and having four channels available was just what I needed. The ability to add a sub cabinet will be a bonus if you play a lot of low rumbling bass sounds in your show, but this amp on it's own is going to fit most people's needs. I would highly recommend this amp.                
Bought this for my kemper amp and electric acoustic guitars, Very loud and clean sounding, great value for you money. You wont be disappointed.                 
Got tired of lugging around 2 powered speakers on gigs so i decided to buy the kxd15. One of the smartest decisions i made!!!!                
I have two of these controllers. Both have the same date code. One is a fixed installation in our venue, the other in one of those 'gig-rig' cases for small shows.  The fixed installation works flawlessly - after replaceing the pc-style coin cell battery.  The one used for mobile setups isn't holding up quite as well.  I'd buy this again for another fixed install, but I'll find something else for my mobile rig.                
Features are OK.  You'll need a 5-pin to 3-pn XLR converter to use it in the states.  It is rack mountable, and the ears come off and it's still a finished look. We had our repair tech swap the 5-pin XLR out of the fixed unit, using a standard 3-pin mic type XLR for ease of wiring.                
It's very Behringer.  The quality isn't bad, it's just not very 'roadworthy'.                
It's a good product for a fixed install, for the buck it's got ease of programming and Behringer reliability.                
I called the Behringer support number and had the answer I needed in less than 8 minutes.  They seemed to know the OEM battery is weak. ;) They also advised terminating long runs with a resistor.  Yes, it's in the manual, but they wanted to be sure I knew about that.  Nice folks.                
I'll use the ones I already have.                
I think I'll go back to the US dj folks for a more roadworthy piece, but I'll keep the mobile unit to add to the house install.                 
it doesn't produce sound, so... the light control ability is good. many options squezed into a medium/small package.                
like i say, loaded with features. may be to many for typical theater use. but i found the pumping lights to bass/mid/treble and chase sync to tempo/beat to be much fun and not too hard to suss out. two 8-12 light channel scenes can be manually dialed in and crossfaded pretty easily.                 
hard to say, yet - we've used it only 4-5 months. it's held up alright. needed a new battery after 3 months. first fader is loose/cuts in-out (time for contact cleaner). the unit does do what it's supposed to. allot of features we've yet to need, but glad to have - espicially for the price.                
this is behringers secret it seems - made in china, designed in germany (?). it's the way of the future. so as china's manufacturing quality improves - the reliability should as well (and eventually the cost).                 
emailed support and within 3-5 days got a very helpful response. they even shipped me a free eprom firmware/op-system upgrade at no cost. this is a good sign that i can rely on a knowledgable support team even if the unit isn't built like a tank (we don't have a department-of-defense budget).                
it's still "new" - but we're using 3-5 behringer units (DIs, feedback killer, multi-gate) and have been happy so far. if you can spend some time to get to know it's features/interface, you'll like what you can do (i do). i'd still reccomend a more traditional unit for theater if cost isn't an issue. but it's a great little do-all. we were using an american dj dmx controller and it wasn't automatic/easy-to-use and died completly after 2 months (it was also a used purchase) - so this unit has restored some of my faith in dmx.                
It is a light controller, but it uses the audio line out from the mixer to sync the lights to the music.   Im am not quite 100 % happy about how it follows the beat.   Sometimes I have to manually jump through the steps of a chase.   It does not put any noise in the sound system.                
For about $ 200 it has lots of features.   No other company ofers so many channels and programs in a small box and so affordable.                
Now that I play with it a lot it is very easy, but in the beginning I had a hard time learning, because the book is very bad.   I gave up trying to use the book and discovered how to program it on my own.
They really need to rewrite the manual.   I would have loved to see a video on how to program and use it, but Behringer does not offer one.                
No problems at all.   It is built well, and looks very nice.
People complain about the battery, but more than two years have past and the battery is still good.  I had to replace the 5 pin DMX connector with one that has 3 pins, and now I connect it to the dimmer packs with microphone cable.                
Yes, I think it does all I want it to do and has features that others did not offer for same price.                
I sent a few emails asking for more info on how to program the chases but they never answered back.
The book is bad, needs to be rewriten by an English or American born person.  Behringer could make a video demostrating how to program the chases and how to use the conroller.                  
People that came and looked at it were impressed.   It looks great.
Most of them think it costs a lot more than what I paid.                
I have no plans to replace it, but if it is stolen I will buy another one just like this one.                
Behringer has did it again. What and AWSOME machine.                
Umm, it doesnt produce a sound you know.... it does have sound to light features which look interesting, but the chase fader and now the main faders have packed in after only a short use so I can't try anything grrr....                
Lovely looking piece of kit for the money, more features than you'd ever need for one gig, plenty of headroom to experiment with it's features which could cover from Disco sound to light to 24 channel theatre lighting and more.... but three important faders have packed in on mine grrr after only a few hours use                
It can do lots of things, so there's lots to read up on from it's manual. I reckon I could write the manual with better context and grammar. I tried to read it in english while trying to think  like a german engineer! it's got lots of nice little features, that you might not use frequently so forget easily, then you're back in the manual, reading English, thinking in German ^_^                
Looks fab straight out of the box, love it's looks. The case is pretty but lightly built, which is ok if you cherish your stuff and look after it like I try to. It can be cased easily enough to protect it's light build - just dont throw it around un-boxed! I am really cheesed off at the failure of main faders though, the unit is unuseable after only a few hours grrrrrrrrr!!!                
If it worked sweetly I would be over the moon with joy at the price. I love it's looks, I am fascinated by the features it packs, It's well capable of what I need and more, very compact, did I say it looks good? - it does. but..... it's let me down horribly by being faulty after such short use.                
Dunno, not tried them yet cause I am so annoyed and fear I'm going to be "fobbed off" with "you probably didnt do this..." which is my usual experience of customer service departments, but I will have to get in touch I guess or bin the unit.                
I still want it, that's why I considered it carefully before I bought it - but...... (read the rest of this review)                
I have another Behringer product - a Virtualizer, nice kit, again more features than you'd ever need in a practical situation. Again, it's manual is set out really badly and not very friendly. That machine works fine - except when used with computer generated audio, where it suffers terribly from digital noise intereference.                
Yeah loads of features for the money if you can find them.                
Manual is a nghtmare. You get into the bit they're teaching you then  it goes off on a complete tangent without completing the tuition in that area.
I thought it was just me but the manual really is so fragmented.
As has been said it  needs rewriting and a video would be gratefully received. 
Steve                 
I purchased this unit here at Zzounds. I am a single vocalist/guitarist and sometimes play with one or two others. My normal venue is a coffee shop. 
This unit provides two independent channels (which can be linked for stereo) so I can put voice on one channel and guitar on the other; this helps performance immensely, because the compression characteristics of voice and instrument are very different. 
The unit has useful (defeatable) automatic functions for attack and release, along with auto knee settings. The peak limiter also has an auto program limiter function. I picked mine up at 3:30 in the afternoon and had it up and running at a job by 5:30. It wasn't yet running optimally, but it was working, making things better. By the next day I had it tweaked to produce maximum benefit.
This unit does two things for me: 1) it makes my amplification system more effective, because the compressed signal comes through with more power at any given amp setting. 2) it allows my music to "sit" above the ambient conversation level of the coffeehouse. Everyone can hear my music, even the softer parts, but the volume is not too high for customers to talk comfortably. Without compression I had to choose between being annoyingly loud or annoyingly inaudible (the quieter parts of the music could not be easily heard by customers.)
The physical build is very high quality, the display is very nice, and the controls are exacting. The de-esser works well, as do the tube simulation and dynamic enhancer. 
The only shortcoming of this unit is the usual Behringer problem: an infuriatingly dense manual that is occasionally incorrect and is always hard to understand. But the unit itself is worth twice the price, and the results exceed expectations. If you are into recording or coffee shops, get this unit!                
I use this tool in my Fred Flintstone studio. I broadcast a music show on SW radio. I needed an up-to-date version for my 1995 "Composer". I couldn't believe the ZZSound price. The audio is alive and clean and much, much louder than the older Composer.                 
I love the limiter action and the DE-esser. There are high frequency restrictions for short wave broadcast and the DE-esser attenuates without being too noticeable, the offending frequencies.                
The 'Composer" is very user friendly, but I felt that the manual's suggestions for settings got me in the ballpark and I proceeded from there.                
It's built like a rock. It should survive in an actual broadcast transmitter enironment very well. Solid metal construction.                
My first Composer was $199.00                
I'll keep this box for quite a while.                
This is a great 2 channel compressor. Buy four, you have 8 for regular size drum kits. It also has a tube button (witch seems to add some 15k highs to brighten your mics a little (especially cheaper ones. Works great.) And also has an enhancer button, witch seems to add a tad of tone (not much really.) Other than that, this compressor is very responsive with little coloration, has a great gate on each channel, along with a rms limiter. I would recommend this to people who need to record drums cheaply, but still need good levels/tone while tracking. You can rely on this for years probably.                
The "adapative" mode makes setting up the system very effective.                
None supplied.  Designed to work into a system.                
I've purchased and used several with my sound system installations. Never a failure.                
Very good value.  Oh, there's better but at considerably more cost.                
Never needed.  Information supplied is very complete                
Good looking compact unit.                
I'll keep using them.                
Of all the things I have done and installed into my system this one piece of hardware has made the most resounding difference. The effects in the Korg 32XD DAW are good, even superlative. However, the compressed signal processing from the Michrophone has annealled the pro sound. It was the one thing needed.                  
This compresser has so many controls it is a little daunting at first, but do what the manual says and some great stuff can happen. I found it relatively easy to use. It looks good. It doesn't heat things up to much and you just half to pay attention to the tweaks that have to be done to get the right nuances.                
The unit is generally a signal processer that once in the line you can forget about it. That is exactly what you need. This gets a great sound. You set it and it does it's job. The price was so good it seems like a good idea to have more than one. Once having used something like this you realize your not gonna get the same control and great sound without it.                 
This unit is made supprizingly well considering it is all steel. This item you can tell is pumped out quick but it does not seem to make a difference. It does what you want it to do. The looks are appropriate. You could give me 1930s English electronics and I would not care. The appearance is just fine.                
DANGTOOTIN GREAT DEAL!!!!! There is no substitute for a good piece of equipment that does what you want it to.                 
Haven't used it. Based on price I don't expect much. Buy another one!!                
It was this component that solidified a real signal processing chain between the recorder and mic. You can't have a weak link in chain.                
This product will be replaced by a new MDX 2600 and maybe a couple more. I want the best too but that is later.                
Still getting familiar with it, but so far we love it.  As good or better than many at twice the price.  De-essing is impressive.                
Actually very easy to use, I am just a slow learner when it comes to new components.                
Again, hard to beat for the money, but also impressive on the features and quality.                
De-essing is surprisingly good.                
I have played with some of the best known compressors in the business... some more expensive than a monthly car payment and I would have to say: Bang for the buck the this comrpessor wins hands donw .. I have the AutoComp 1600 on loan and was impressed on how it handled hard to mix live situations... I plan to get another two channels worth of this particular compressor for my Live/Bass/Studio rig GREAT JOB                
couldnt ask for a prettier set of lights that you could see from across the room to let you know its doing its job .. the brushed steel look with balck face and trim makes it look class act.                
never had to call support... the product is just that good ...                 
'nuf said..                
I iwll be back to get more stuff from that company ...                 
Using the Interactive Knee feature, this thing is invisible!                
It has an AUTO function for the attack and release functions that works very well and eliminates unnecessary knob twisting.                
For the money, this is a good value.  I like how the power supply is built in which means no wall-wart PSU.  The dancing LEDs are beautiful when in use.  The lights are not just for show either.  There are lights that show when the expander/gate, compression interactive knee, de-esser, and peak limiter are active.  The more the lights dance, the better you have it dialed in. The LEDs in the switches are bright, maybe too bright, because some light leaks into the switches that are off and not supposed to be lit.                
I paid just over a hundo (US) including shipping.  I think this unit is an EXCEPTIONAL value.                
So many languages!  If this is your first experience with a dynamics processer, you may be a bit overwhelmed at first.  The manual is bare minimum.                
I bought this unit for recording/broadcasting so I could use my Alesis Nanocompressor elsewhere.  It has met my expectations 110%.  If I could change one thing, I would have phono-plugs for the input/output instead of the 1/4" jacks.  Maybe thats an engineering decision Behringer made because there is another market out there that would be upset without them.                
The sound is very good. No pumping and breathing, no special effects. Does a good job of invisible compression, noise floor elimination and limiting. I noticed no difference with the tube emulator. Stereo couple causes a slight unequal pan out so I dont use that. It is not too hard to tweak each channel to the same settings since the knobs are rotary encoders. Bought this for my analog synthesizer and it does the job quite nicely.                 
the best feature for me is the interactive knee. The unit is easy to use and sounds good. I noticed no difference with the tube emulator. Stereo couple causes a slight unequal pan out so I dont use that. It is not too hard to tweak each channel to the same settings since the knobs are rotary encoders. I very much applaud the lighting. It not only looks cool but it really helps tell you how well you have all the knobs dialed in and they reflects changes in the compression. you can see and hear what you are doing.                 
It is easy to get good compression with this without unwanted effects. The interface is layed out well and it's easy to use. The issue is the manual, which is written poorly. I had to learn compression from various internet articles and then apply them to this compressor and spent a saturday afternoon on it, without too much difficulty.                 
Quite reliable and has a nice brushed steel and black appearance.I use it in a studio only, so no comment on roadworthiness.                  
It is a good, invisible compressor / expander / limiter with interactive knee / invisible compression and lots of dancing lights to help you tweak the knobs at a value price, reliable and does the job. Reccommended.                
never had to contact Behringer. I read behringer products gets mixed reviews but after reading reviews on this product, I ordered it from zzounds and it has not dissapointed. I use it on a regular basis.                
product appeal: price and the knobs and LEDs. I was advised to buy into plug-in VST compressors but I wanted the real thing I could touch, tweak the kobs, see the lights as a new song plays. The black and silver look good.                 
It helped my music by compressing my analog synth nicely and improving the overall level and sound of it. I would replace it.                 
The sound of this thing is real nice. I've only tested it out, I jsut got it so I havent done alot of recording yet. So far, I can see where this piece of equipment can be very useful.                
the features all sounnd really nice. the compressor is good, the limiter is fine, and I'm really enjoying the enhancer feature that brings the brightness of the signal back after compression.                
the manual doesnt give you the best details in the set up as far as giving examples, but I didnt have much of a problem figuring it out. I'm not by far the best with learning new equipment on my own, but if I can do it, any one with any common knowledge can.                
I cant find a flaw. I mean, its not built like a tank, but I dont need a tank in my studio.                 
for the price, you can't beat the quality of this thing. You get more for less.                
I've had a few Behringer products and I've never had the pleasure of dealing with the customer service reps.                
Its way better than not having one. It really dosnt matter what kind of compressor or how much you pay, this kind of electronics is sorta solid and more exspencive stuff dosnt help, its all the same!!                
Really good stuff..took me a few days to get everything down but in the end it all was amazing!                
it was so light when i first picked it up. It was really easy to slap it to a rack mount. I just baught it but if u treat your stuff right it should last no matter what knind u get!
the sound was amazing. Just great                
Look.....u cant get anything cheaper for this stuff. if your paying any more than 190$ for this you can get it cheaper!!                
I actully have called behringer befor and they were quite good. Iv called a few places but nothing as good as BEHRINGER!!                
man....if this was a woman i would have annaliated it!!!                
i dont care what anyone says this product kicks all friggin ass alright. I love it. I baught 3 of them!!!!                
It has no sound which is what it is designed for.                
Nice gate feature in addition to normal compressor features                
Easy to use if you're use to setting up compressors                
I've used Behringer compressors for years without any problems.  Some have written reviews complaining of their failure, but I've never had a problem with one.  In this day and time of cheap production even the "name brands" can have issues.                
For the features in this unit, plus getting four (4) individual compressor channels in 1 unit it is hard to beat for the price.  Several years ago there was an article in a well known music magazine with a major music producer who admitted to using Behringer compressors in his own studio. So...                
Never needed it yet.                
Functional, no sex appeal                
Again, I've used Behringer compressors for years both in live and studio situations without any problems.  Some have knocked them, but it may have been because they really didn't know how to properly set up a compressor.  I would buy one and use the savings to buy better quality microphones which is where the "how good is your sound" starts whether you're live or studio.                
I have been an audio/recording/pro-sound engineer for 30 years. I recently purchased this unit for use in a concert simply to control all the inputs to the board (hint - best live sound compresses/limits EVERY channel). The Multicom has very nice features for the price range. It's not going to compare to a Focusrite or Avalon but you're not paying thousands of dollars either.  If you're a gigging band with your own sound, or have a local rig for your instrument where you submix a feed to the main board, this unit will definitely do the job. May or may not use it in a studio but the features work competently and when we used it in a large stage setting, the people giving us a standing ovation and yelling for more didn't notice the price or brand name of our compressor. Best value for working musicians/bands.                
When it works, it sounds as good as any other compressor or gate I've used                
Great combindation of features for the price                
Bought two units. One had it's CH#3 gate begin sticking a month into use. The second unit developed a problem 2 months later; audio barely audible and distorted. Never had a problem with other Behringer products...very happy with their line. But this model has only been out for a year, I suspect design or mfg quality problems                
This model only....otherwise Behringer products have been a very good value for me                
Forget it.....big company selling products dirt cheap, you'll spend more time and money trying to get it serviced than it's worth. Don't respond to emails...you're pretty much on your own.                
Need to find a replacement now                
items work good when it works. I purchased 2 of these units and both are giving me problems, one has a very bad distortion in all channels and thee other keeps shorting out in channel 2 and 3 giving a extrembly bad distortion sound then chops up the sound. veery disappointed. I quess it true you get what you pay for....                
okay when it works                
easy to use.....                
poorly made product.....                
good price but product is terrible.                
the worse warranty support in the industry. Do not return emails or phone calls. It took severial phone calls and emails in order to get a warranty claim #.                
bad product not happy                 
As a follow up on the warrantee of the MDX4600.  I purchased a competitors compressor to get back in operation quickly.  It took over two months and many phone calls and emails but I DID receive an new as a warrantee exchange.  If a failure occurrs you must be patient.  Buy two of them and keep one as a spare!                
Amazing little instrument. I bought this because I needed a quick way to connect my shock mounted voice mic to a sound card that didn't provide the 48V phantom power needed to run the mic. What I got was incredibly enhanced sound that really extended the feature set of my mic system. 
The warm tones and clean sound alone, make this a great piece of equipment for the money.                
I really like the features of this little device. I can use it with or without the 48V phantom power for my mic, simply by pressing the button. It has a button for 20db boost, and I really like the mechanical (analog) control it gives me outside of my computer sound setup. No mouse needed to set the gain or output.                 
Outstanding quality, build, fit, and finish.                
I would say it's well worth the money. I actually paid list because I needed it, and it's well worth the money.                
Haven't needed the support yet.                
It's not something you might think you want until you have it. It's not a sexy product by looks or specs, but by sound, you can't beat it!                
Don't see trading it, but I might buy more of them.                
Excellent sound quality - using to power a condenser mike and connect to a ham radio.                
It does get quite warm to the touch - I'm going to add a small fan on the outside to aid in venting.                
Well built and small enough to fit in my crowded shelf.                
Does the job as advertised. It provides more than enough gain for any circumstance.                
Nothing spectacular - it just works!                
Overall, very pleased.                
Clear sounding, No real coloring to the sound which is what its suposed to do.
I own a Tube MP(ART). This sounds the exact same.                
More features than my Tube MP. I assume that Behringer Copied the design very closely.
As with most low priced gear its componats could use some upgrading(better tube, ect ect). but these can be done by local shops.                
Good Build, Behringer makes a good product that keeps working and is tough as nails.                
Very Very good value, I plan to get another.                
Five here since I have never in my 5 years of using behringer products had to contact them for support.                
I like the case and the vibe of it. The Chicken head knobs give it a retro vibe.                
I cant realy say how long I would stay satifyed with anything as I like to use multiple brands of simular things as they all sound diferent. So I will say its a good piece that will stay in my collection.
As we can see some people dont know how to use something as simple as a Mic pre.
DOnt listen to their ignorant ramblings. This realy is a great product for a dirt cheap price.                
Swap the tube, it makes a huge difference.  I put in a electro-harmonix 12AX7EH, really improved the sound and reduced hum quite a bit.  Going back to the stock tube would reduce my rating from an 9 to a 7.  I'm going to scrap the stock opamps and go with something a bit more cleaner.  If that works like it did on my 3630 compressor, I would have to change my sound rating to an 11.
The limiter really ruins the sound and keeps me from even thinking of anything higher than an 9.  In fact I'd be really ticked if I couldn't turn it off.  Avoid any setting with the limiter engaged.  It just brings in the mud, wipes out any clarity at all levels. (You should know that this is just about par for any kind of limiter, IMHO, just not normally this bad at really low levels.)                
Its a simple 1 channel preamp, how many features does it need?  What you do get is important though.                
Once again, single channel, gain and level knobs, easy...  Just watch out, you're not using the tube on any modeling setting that doesn't have the "warmth band" beside it.                
Been my first stage preamp, directly after my bass and before my Tech21 SansAmp, for over two years now.  It goes with me on the road, I just toss it in back of the rack with the cables.  Works every time I pull it out.
Great for being able to adjust the level of different basses, even switching to an upright, so I can use one rack with all the rest of my gear without having to change a hundred knobs to get the right sound.  As long as the meter on this is peaking at 0, I know my effects will sound like I want them.
Don't listen to the retard who says the tube isn't hooked up.  It is, just only operational on the models with the "warmth band" next to it.  On neutral its just a transparent buffer/level converter.  Don't believe me?  Take it apart and pull the tube, set the model on "valve".  Any idiot holding the manual could tell you this :)                
Cheap and it works!                
The best support is the kind you never had to use!                
Great size, just wish it had a power switch and mute switch.  Neither of which is a deal breaker and if I needed that bad enough there is enough room to install one myself.  Quick side note: I currently use the "20dB pad" button as some kind of mute when I switch instruments, this works well enough that I have not added a pure mute switch.                
Nice tube tone. Running this for electric guitar. Between external preamp & the guitar amp. Gives the solid state preamp/amp a nice warm tube tone. However, this is not a overdrive box, gives a nice crunch when cranked, but not wat would expect from a tube amp. Set clean, it nicely warms up the input signal into a nice thick glassy tube amp tone.                
Gain, Output, Phase Reverse, etc... Limiter has no controls, only on & off. Not very useful, as it sounds unnatural.                
Well built and sturdy. Not really road worthy, but not designed for that. I was skeptical bout how "good" the stock preamp tube was. It's probably some OEM 12AX7A, labelled Behringer. So I replaced it with a Sovtek 12AX7LPS. Turns out the stock tube sounds much warmer & smoother.                
At that price...                
Never needed to. Haven't own this long enough to warrant it as well. I wasn't happy with one of their products I bought in the past, and the dealers allow for exchange to other products, no questions asked.                
Already own it. Several similar problems on the market, by Art & dbx. Behringer is known to be rip offs, but this time, did Art rip off dbx or vice versa?                
Well worth the money just for guitar alone. Several other good reviews on it running as a mic preamp.                
As a mic pramp it's a bit noisy but actually really sounds good for the price. Remember, it costs less than a hundred bucks! A good pre will set you back a couple of grand!                
It seems to have and do everything that the ART Tube MP Studio V3 has but for less money. I don't own the ART unit but I would assume that their quality would be about the same. I wish it had a power switch though.                
absolutely simple to use. The knobs have a good feel and a cool classic look. Watch your output level, it gets noisy real fast.                
I think you get what you pay for. However I have several other Behringer products that I have been using for over six years without any problems whatsoever. 'Most' of their gear works well. I don't anticipate any difference with this tube pre. I had the luxury of trying a $2000.00 UA 610 pre at the same time and I can tell you that it's worth every penny and more. I plan on getting one. However this little puppy also makes a great stage DI for my acoustic guitar so when I can afford a "real" Mic Pre in my studio this unit will still be paying for itself on stage.                  
It's a  smokin' deal for the price and as long as it holds up' I'll probably buy more as DI units for stage                
I've never had to call for any support for any reason before. So I can't answer. Everything they make, usually come with a fairly comprehensive manual, printed in about 20 languages!                
The knobs sold me in five seconds. The sound actually surprised me instantly and it actaully looks quite nice. I practically bought it before I tried it.                
If it lasts for even a year as a DI box then I will never use a passive DI box again. My studio doubles as a 'mobile unit' and I don't know how I feel about dragging my studio rack around with a mic pre that costs more than my DAW itself. this unit is small, portable, sounds pretty decent and is 'disposable'. Any studio could use a unit like this at some point. The best hundred bucks I spent in a long time!                
Sounds Great! Have used it in multiple locations running into several different systems, always has a consistent sound and makes Vocals sound much, much warmer - it also improves the awful sounding SM58's and other dynamic mic's i have used with it considerably. Used with a low noise condenser like the NT-1A it is phenomenal. It Warms up everything you patch through it. Noiseless - which is a major feature.                
Once again - noiseless - strong construction - especially for the price. If i had to fault it - it would be the limiter, but everything else no problems. The knobs at first feel kind of weak - but after a couple of months that still work perfectly.                 
Seems well made - after 2 months of constant use it is not looking like falling apart or anything like that - still looks brand new and acts like it is the first time out of the box. It does get a little hot once you leave it on for a few hours, but you would expect that considering the tube in the middle of it all. It has taken a few hard knocks and a couple of falls - and has travelled with me a lot, overall very sturdy and still in perfect shape.                
For what it does - i would easily pay triple, and previously did. I have a few other Behringer products i have purchased after this one, and so far the value of all is outstanding.                
Never needed it - doesn't look like i am ever going to.                
The looks are not going to set the world on fire - but the sound sure makes up for it - so that's why i am rating this one 7 - aesthetically it is bland, who knows though - slap some glossy paint on it and it may just get sexy - i doubt it though.                 
At this point if i lost this baby i would definitely replace it. It will most likely always have a place in my setup - for its sheer simplicity alone. I will be supplementing my setup with a multiple input pre-amp in the not too distant future - but i can't see going a day recording without getting some sort of benefit from having this one along. Before i bought this i tried out a couple of other pre-amps - one being the Prosonus TubePre - which 3 times the price - and it went straight back to the store because it was awful sounding and noisy - this little puppy in comparison is a dream come true - noiseless and more sturdy construction.                 
This is the first pre-amp I have owned, and I can say for $30... I am very pleased. Has a nice sound when combined with my condensor.                
Just your basic plug it in and go features. Not many options.                
This is my first ever mic pre so I'm going to give this machine a good grade. It made a difference on the overall warmer presence of the tone. I'd have to say I like it. Bear in mind, I was looking at the price because I've never used one before, too. So, in all I'd say it was worth the effort, the price for the sound improved.                
The Behringher c2 microphone is a sturdy piece of equipment that collects sound well. The Behringher tube ultragain MIC100 was very easy to set up and connect. to my computer. I did wind up purchasing a new usb external sound card because The proprietary one in my pc was insufficient. Both great products and a great price.                
It does add some warmth to the tone. Although I noticed that you will inevitably have some low background hiss. I spent some time adjusting the gain until it wasn't too bad. It does reproduce the sound quite clear however                
Nothing fancy. standard preamp features. gain, phantom power, limiter. pretty basic                
2 knobs and a few buttons. you should be able to figure it out in a few minutes                
I would have given this more than a 6 if it hadn't crapped out on me after just over a year of having it. I thought the tube may have burnt out so I replaced it to no avail. I guess you get what you pay for. Don't expect this product to last forever......you're probably lucky if you get a few years out of it                
I guess the value isn't that bad considering how cheap it is. The sound quality is not that bad either considering it is such an inexpensive unit. So while it was working I was pleased, but don't expect it to last for you cause it's not durable at all                
I wrote some emails and got nothing back                
It's a good paper weight on my desk I guess
also a drink coaster
multiple functions...                
Overall, if you're a solo musician just lookin to throw together a few recordings to see what you sound like, it will do the job. Just remember you're getting what you pay for                
This thing sounds like a toy. Thin, dull, and cheap. I would much prefer an art tube MP or anything for that matter.                
It makes a good drink coaster.                
I suppose it is self explanatory.                
Cheap Chinese junk. I opened it up, and the tube does not even run through the circuitry.                 
For 30 bucks I could build a cheaper one.                
Behringer in general is crappy.                
Heck no! Its an ugly white box and not even rack mountable.                
This thing is a toy. Do not waste your money. It is actually annoying to my ears. Most of the people who have left decent comments  have probably never used anything else.                
First off this is an excellent product and I'm 100% satisfied with it's performance.  I would like to say that changing the tube is a small challenge, but you will more than likely do that if you are into ultra low microphonics and want to go with a lower gain, say a 5751 tube.   I went with the 5751 and although it was a task to change, it was well worth the effort.  I mean, at $99, just the electronics are worth it, nomatter what tube, just that our crew is going for the sweetest sound possible and this unit delivers.                
I was in need of a preamp and I've had experience with Behringer products in the past....did some research and came across this preamp..many folks talk smack about Behringer but I had a combo amp from Behringer and it survived a flood....thus preamp rocks...the three band EQ and built in sonic maximizer are incredible...for the price you can't go wrong...the tube give an extra boom and warmth to my bass....I luv it!!!!                
The sound is quiet enough noise wise, and the gain given is smooth but not ultra punchy.  I used it for vocals mainly and lately on stereo mixdowns, which I'm not totally convinced on the later. On the subject of the tube - it really is only on the post gain that the tube is employed and the yellow light thing that fades in is just a LED. I've never really heard the tube in that regard.                
Using the EQ is do-able but not surgical or invisible.  The variable req low cut is great. A chain I use alot is; channel 1 for gain and pre compressor eq - into a compressor for de-essing and compression - back into channel 2 for re-gaining and EQ to maximize level for soundcard AD. So even if you want you can get a lot of use out of the two parametric EQs for even one vocal mic.                
It takes all sorts of beatings, shipped it overseas and around the place, there was one bit of plastic rattling around in there for a while but I opened it and shook it out.                
I bought it a while ago and now it's cheaper to buy new!                
Sort of over it now but it was the only pre I used for a while, I'm looking for the next step up. I'd still use it on other gear to get more control on synths and the like.                
I've used a few different low priced mic preamps and this one sounds the best by far!  Vocals sound very crisp.  However, when I used unbalanced cables to output to my computer I could hear a very distinct hum that brought the noise floor way up.  Balanced cables never gave me that problem, though.                
The lo cut feature was very useful.                
Amazing!  Really livened up the signal of my lead vocals.                
As far as I can tell this thing is amazing.                
Good stuff.  I've used it for about 9 months now on different gigs and hasn't let me down yet!                
What can I say?                
Haven't needed support.                
This is one fine piece of equipment.  It has really brought out everything that I could hope for in our vocals.  That's all we've used it for so I can't speak for the DI function of using with a line in function.  I would recommend it to anyone that asked.                
Has a nice sound.. makes vocals sound Fuller, and when mixed down, blends in nice with the beat. i have not used it for anything other than a mic preamp.. but once set right makes good sounding, crisp vocals.                
Have not really messed with this yet.. just using it as a mic preamp for now.                
Havent really gone outside of RODE, OR MACKIE.. but i figured ill give this a try because of the price.. for the price.. DEFF! got the best sound. VERY GOOD QUALITY.                
u cant get a nicer mic preamp for this price! great quality for the price.. hit me up if you need a sample of the vocals i get from it.                
havent tryed this yet.                
good additon to the rack.. nice basic. hi-tech look.. good quality, nice style.                
mos deff got the best out of my $$ got it for $120 with shipping, easy setup, great sound. hoping this will be a good additon to studio.                
I own two of these. New, they were very clean, crisp and transparent. Lots of available gain. Solid state with mild tube edge. New, they were great.
On one, with age, a phntom power button fell apart, and the use of the eqs introduces intrusive amounts of noise. 
On the other, all kinds of noise has popped up. Lots of hiss, some hum. If the input gain is minimzed, so is the noise. The output gain is clean. I use these to enhance the limited sound of the wireless instrument capsule mic in my rig. A good pre has proven worthwhile, but the noise level from this one makes it unusable unless a gate is in the loop. I went back to my older one which has only been used for home recording and it has the same amount of noise - and I don't recall it having been that way before.  So...new, 10, but aged, 6, which in a pre, makes it junk.                
It'd be nice if they all worked. Nice metering, phantom power, internal PS, balanced I/O, phase reverse and flexible EQ. EQ in one unit is a no-go. Other unit is clean and works fine. Output stage is good, but input stages are pretty rough.                 
I'd say 10, except that NOW it's a pain to use because I have to play games with gain to minimize noise. I've got something else on order.                
Two units, both mediocre after just over 1 yr of use, and I'm kind to my gear. I like Behringer products, but based on this experience I will not buy another pre from them, including the well-reviewed VX2496. 
Horrid power-off crackle. Also horrid pop with the eq in/out button. You CAN'T switch it live... it's that bad. With gains high, the pots make signal noise.                
Limited vaklue at best. Both units are still clean as line-in DIs. Sound is still good with hotter inputs, like handheld mics. Fine with a gate. I still find the sound very good as long as minimal gain is needed.                
No experience                
Who puts a fakey backlit tube in a plastic window?                
I will not buy another pre from Behringer.                
If you don't need alot of gain, and you don't use the eq, this unit is clean, clean, clean. very breathy, crystal sound, but not harsh...just accurate. Moderate to heavy gain introduces hiss and humm to an unacceptable, i.e., can't use it, level.                
Great features, until they quit. EQ in one is extremely noisey. My other one overheated outdoors and just quits once its warmed up.                 
easy enuf to use, until they develop problems.                
I really reaaly like behringer products. This, however, does not get my vote. Signal POPs loud with eq in/out buttons, 48V buttons, line/mic buttons. One button stopped latching, hardly ever used. Unit is not vented, and self-overheated.                
As a DI its probably great. Inability to hold up is poor.                
replaced with presonus tubepre.                
Sounds OK when not clipping but this unit has insufficient headroom for live performance. Change singers after it is trimmed and you may not like the outcome if the next guy is a little louder. +10dBu is not enough input range. Noise floor is acceptable when used individually but when used in groups the power supply noise is additive being in phase. This can be dealt with by throwing the odd unit out of phase but that is not always practical.                
I originally bought for the DI/splitter function and as front end for Alesis HD24XR. Lots of I/O connections.                
Build quality is actually pretty good but it's apparent the bean counters didn't let Behringer's engineers do what they wanted to do with this unit.                
For rookie sound engineers this will be one of those pieces they are happy with until they get something better and realize the problems they had were not due to them. It's, at best, Ok for home recording but unusable for live unless you know your signal source very, very well.                
Haven't need to deal with this yet. Web site is good.                
Yeah it looks nice. Dig the lit buttons.                
Not quite what I was hoping for. I will dissect one and see if it can be made better but my guess is that will take major surgery. I'm looking forward to buying a trio of octal preamps or design my own to replace these but now I have a better idea what I need. I'm over the "tube" mystique. I need a preamp with at least 16dBu of input capability.                
I bought this so I could record while travelling because bringing my full size interface isn't sensible and this will fit in my guitar case. I will say I'm quite impressed the sound quality and the options. My expectations weren't extremely high, but it actually comes very close to the quality I get out of my much more expensive full size interface.The preamp options are also excellent, the Valve setting really warms up the sound of direct guitar and I think I will be able to get better than demo quality recordings with it. I haven't put it through it's paces on vocals yet but I think it will replace my other interface for guitar tracking. For $60 it really is a good buy and zZounds was super fast with the shipping                
This Mix 800 is great. Sounds better than my Voco Pro 890 karaoke machine. The Mix 800 has both reverb and echo, the 890 only has echo. Plus the unit is small, which is a plus. Voice canceler is not something I use. Own four Behringer MX8500 mics and this unit is great using the mics. Compliments my home Karaoke system.                
This product does not do anything it says it will do. The only thing it cancels is the music.                
this mixer/canceler is suited for kids/novelty use at best. When you activate the voice cancel feature the music source becomes very muffled and difficult to modulate. But then again for the price it is what it is, a low priced item with quality and performance to match. If you are looking for a crystal clear sound with voice track removed, this is not what you are looking for.                
wasn't expecting much for $150.00. I was very much surprised when I hooked it up to my jbl and cube monitors and my akg q701 cans. the sound is very quiet and true, its well built and the " big knob" feels like the real deal and everybody loves big knobs!                
What a great midi controller, this works great live or in the studio. Can you find another keyboard with motorized faders at this price? I don't think so! It works with several of the top DAW's out there. You won;t be disappointed with this one!                 
The Behringer Europort MPA40BT  is a great all in one Battery Powered PA for less than 180.00 on the street. Two channels line in or XLR.  Bluetooth and USB Digital 2 Mic Capability.  Power for 8hrs. It solves a problem for the gigging musician who has paying gigs for 50-150 people but dose not need the power a DJ would need for a dance floor party.  So many gigs just need some general power to amplify for a small group.  This is an easy set up and makes for a nice gig paying 175.00-300.00 and in a park or backyard.  Just grab your guitar the Europort MPA40BT and maybe a mic or a few battery powered effects and You good to go.  I could see busking with this too in NYC.  The Bluetooth feature let's you stream from your iPhone or Android device.  I've used it with my Andy Culpepper Spruce Blanca with a LR Baggs Dual Source and my Cordoba GKSL with a Fishman Presus Blend.  Both sound great.  Thank you Michael Perez for sharing the information on the Behringer Europort MPA40BT with me.  
I am 100% satisfied with this speaker use it for wedding ceremonies as well as outback of my house and small parties. More than loud enough I haven't even come close to pushing it. The battery life is as advertised. Works better as a line in bit the Bluetooth is fun and easy when sound quality is not as important.                
So, here first the info the I was looking for when I was shopping for battery powered amps before: I used the MPA40BT with two Channels, at more than 50% Volume with a microphone on channel 1, Guitar on channel 2 for 8 hours straight outside playing music, and the battery indicator was still yellow, which should be about 50% power remaining. So I believe the 12 hour power claim. I am pleasantly surprised that it sounds very good. The drawback is so far only that the guitar fades very strongly when you sing. Otherwise this amp has exceeded my previous expectations. It is loud enough to play in the Street and be heard nicely. Mic Sound is great, a build in reverb would be an additional great feature, since I am working entirely battery powered. The Pro handle works great as well. Put a bag on top of the amp and your cart is ready to be pulled to the gig. The Bluetooth sounds great as well. I loaded some Karaoke tracks on my phone and they worked great as backing tracks. Paired the amp with the push of one button. Easy. I think I chose the right amp for busking.  I had no contact with the Manufacturer, but I am required to rate it ???. Well, I put five stars just hoping that Behringer will offer great support in case something should go wrong.  I will keep you posted since I used the Amp only several time so far, but under serious work conditions. If there should be a problem later, I will update this review. Thanks.                
Recently purchased this item after trying out the Roland Street Cube EX.  Although the Street Cube has a lot more to offer as far as Effects, it can't compare to the power and sound of the Behringer MPA40BT-Pro with Bluetooth!!!  The Behringer has more low end and full range sound and is louder than the Roland for 1/3rd the price!  Now the Roland offers 4 inputs, but the Behringer MPA40-BT has 4 also.  2 Hi Z inputs and or Low Z inputs.  3rd channel is Bluetooth wireless, and 4th is RCA.  For my situation, We only needed two.  Don't get me wrong, Roland Street Cube is a very well made and well thought out unit, but for 1/3rd the price and better sound and louder over all projection, the Behringer MPA40BT-Pro works better!                
Sound response for mic'ed actors was exceptional using Shure BLX body mics. They also sound great for karaoke with the cheap, tried-and-true Nady DKW Duo. I also tested them wirelessly with an Akai EWI5000, and the sound was clean, pure, and LOUD. As you would expect for speakers of this size, they're a little light on bass, but even at that, the bass was far better than I expected it to be.                
Take your pick. 12+ hours of battery life, Bluetooth, sound quality, multiple inputs, independent level controls for each input, handy wheels and extending handle.                
They worked flawlessly and easily right out of the box.                
Build quality seems very solid, but only time will tell. My only complaint about the build is that the plastic of the outer housing is a little slick and doesn't want to hold onto the stick-on velcro pads I put there for the wireless receivers and external batteries to go with them. I solved that problem with a little bit of Gorilla Glue.                
You can't get a better battery powered Bluetooth speaker for the money, and you can't even get CLOSE to a battery powered DJ speaker of this quality for the money.                
I have not needed support for these speakers, but I've dealt with Behringer before, and they've always provided good warranty service.                
People loved these speakers at the show we did this week. They were amazed that not only was the sound exceptional, the speakers were completely wireless and mobile.                
I had a specific plan in mind when I bought them, and they surpassed my expectations, so I wanted to share it here.First thing, I want to address the battery issues some people have reported on other reviews. Mine have worked flawlessly in their first real world outing. I used these speakers for the past week as satellite speakers for mic'ed actors in a Shakespeare production. After every three hour performance, they still showed 4 bars of battery. We recharged them every night just in case, but we wouldn't have needed to. If you get these speakers and have battery issues, my advice would be to contact Behringer for warranty. I've used Behringer products for years as a mobile DJ and as a theatre sound technician, and their customer and warranty service has always been exceptional.Second, I want to talk about something else people have complained about. These speakers do not have an "out" connection. That does NOT mean you can't use two of them in stereo, wirelessly, you just need to put a little ingenuity and investment into it. I already had an Alto Stealth wireless audio transmitter/receiver system. The thing about the wireless system is that the receivers run on very little power. So little that, with the purchase of a $10 5v to 12v USB boost adapter, you can run the receivers off an external cell phone battery. I purchased a pair of 16750 mAh batteries to go along with them, and a pair of boost adapters. Now these speakers are 100% wireless without the signal delay you often get from Bluetooth. I attached the batteries and receivers to the sides of the speakers with velcro. This worked flawlessly, every single night. So I can put these speakers anywhere, in stereo or mono, in pairs or one at a time, without having to run a single cable for audio OR power.These speakers are LOUD, much louder than you'd expect, with decent bass for their size. You wouldn't want to run them in a night club without a subwoofer, but for your average quick-setup small to medium karaoke night these are going to be fantastic. I will be using them in a 220 seat theatre for karaoke night at the end of the month, and I don't expect to have any issue at all with filling the room with sound. Granted, it's a theatre, not a football stadium, so your mileage may vary.I also tested one of these out by itself as the speaker for an Akai EWI 5000 wind synthesizer, and the sound is incredible. The battery system I described above also is more than enough to power the EWI wireless receiver. That means that these speakers are almost ideal for busking with an EWI. With a decent mic plugged in, and an acoustic-electric guitar, I also think they would be fantastic for small acoustic gigs.Do NOT use the mic that comes with the speaker! It's barely a toy. Get yourself at the very least a Nady Starpower or a Behringer Ultravoice on the low end, or invest in a decent Shure PG or SM58 (go with the SM if you can spare the extra $40).The Bluetooth on these speakers is as easy to connect as any, and the sound quality is as excellent as any other connection. The only reason I don't use Bluetooth for gigging is you can't sync two speakers together, and because there's enough of a delay in signal to make it useless for karaoke or live music. But if you're just going to be playing music from your phone, computer, or tablet, you cannot get a better battery powered speaker for the price.Granted, I've only tested these speakers real-world for a week, but if they keep working as well as they have been, I have no doubt they'll be my go-to speakers for most applications outside of large weddings or night club gigs. They're worth every penny I've put into them.                
I bought this speaker not knowing too much about it , I bought it for my son to use it for his marching band at his HS ...for practice they needed something that would be portable , well it is great , the batteries last 12-15 hours at least !  and I used it last Saturday for a wedding ceremony outside and it worked outstanding !! Now I wouldny DJ with this speaker but I would take it to the park , beach or wherever and listen to my music in a very very respectable nice sound .    Yes  I would recommend this speaker .. 
Bluetooth works easily and flawlessly.  Great sound and plenty of it for what it is. Battery lasts hours. I use it for outdoor wedding intro and recession music.                 
This little speaker can put out some amazing sound. I only found one small issue with this bad boy. I do not know how strong a Bluetooth signal can be, but whenever I use it in my house and walk to other rooms ( phone in pocket ) the sound becomes intermittent, I guess the walls hinder the signal. However, it has good range in open areas, or outdoors. Might be prudent to purchase a PA tripod stand, it projects the sound 10 fold as opposed to having it on the floor/ground. I use this thing a lot and has good battery life before having to charge it.                 
I am impressed with this PA. The sound quality is great. The Bluetooth works great and we are able to use this in different places we sing. This will be especially good for our Easter Sunrise service and later, the Memorial Day service, both which are held in the local cemetery where there is no power. The battery is strong enough to handle all the sounds. We have tried some higher priced karaoke machines but they lacked quality. This machine did not let us down. We also bought a wireless mic which made it even better.                
This 8-inch 40-watt speaker has an amazing sound and functionality for a battery-powered unit.  At 20 lbs., it's perfect for music and sound reinforcement at a beach wedding.  I just carry the speaker, stand, and laptop to the sand, power on and start the prelude music.                
The Behringer MS16 Active Personal Monitor is a great set of powered speaker.                
It comes ready to use, right out of the box.                
Very easy to use.
Great  for home, office, desk and laptop.
I use this set of speakers to mix the tracks that I record on my Tascam DP-008. They are excelent monitors for home studio.                
Behringer makes excellent products.
Excellent sound and controls
The MS16 is one of them.
I am very happy with Behringer products.                
The price of the Behringer MS16 is the best one on the market.
About five years ago I bought the same kind of monitor made by Roland (the MA-8)and the price was way higher than the actual price of the Behringer MS16.
All the products that I have from Behringer work very well.
So far, I have not used the support yet.                
I just needed a pair of monitor for my home studio                
The MS16 is a great set of speakers with  excellent sound quality, and I expect to use this pair of monitor for some years to come.                
The sound is pretty good.  Keep in mind these are "budget" monitors, and for $60.00 they're well worth it.  My only complaint about them is how they handle low frequencies.  I have to back off on the bass when I'm using my synths.  However, when using my Fostex digital 8 track (MR-8B) they sound quite nice!                
I'm going to give features a 10 for several reasons.  My (10) rating is based on what all they included on these speakers for under $60. You get bass and treble control, there is a 1/4 mic jack on the front--with its own volume control, and on the rear there are two more sets of inputs.  One being RCA, and the other one is a 1/8 jack.  You can have three connections to these speakers at one time.  Plus the size of the monitors allows them to set nicely into a desktop setup without taking much space.
Also keep in mind that these monitors aren't "new" per say.  These particular monitors are actually the old "Roland Micro Monitors" with the Behringer name.  They're the exact same thing.                 
Very easy to use.  There's nothing to them.  Plug them into the wall, connect your gear, and push the power button :)                
Quality is very good for the price range.  Again, lower frequencies (when using keyboards) can cause distortion.                
For less than $60 truely a "great value".  They're worth every penny.  Even if you don't do studio work, these would make a great substitute for cheap (good sounding) computer speakers, or anything you want to hook up to them (ipods, CD players, ect).                
I've contacted them regarding other products and service was always good.                
Great sex appeal...:)  They got a clean design to them, and just looking at them you can't help but think-- "Hmmmmmm how do those puppies sound?"                
I plan on being satisfied with them as long as they "continue to work".  When they break--then I'll be unsatisfied.  If they broke today I'd buy another pair.  For the price you can't go wrong.  Well worth it.                
Very big sound.  I was highly impressed.  My one gripe is they are very "heavy" sounding.  The low frequencies are most prominent when used with the bass and treble knobs at a flat response.  You can adjust them manually but I would like them to be a bit more flat sounding.  For 60 bucks, I am not complaining.  I will admit, this is the weakest link in my chain, but if you can make your mix sound good on these, trust me, it will sound good anywhere.                
For what they are they work good. We use them for non-linear editing system. They are better than computer speakers, better built, not hi-fidelity. We looked at some of the more expensive ones that sounded a little better but for three times the price I thought whatever. We bought the MS16's                
Good features for the money                
Easy to use. Everything's labeled on the speaker.                
Good value for the money. They're cheap, but well worth $70                
Good bang for the buck.                
No                
Basic                
Hope it lasts several years                
Sound is terrific to me gotta love them.. you can really hear everything. No hiss in less you turn the treble up all the way then you hear a little bit.. Beats the hell out of computer speakers!                
they are ok really wish they had 1/8 jacks so i plug directly into my interface as 1/8 instead of quarter inch..                
Its made pretty cheap what do you expect your only paying like 60 bucks so.. What more can you expect?                
Dont need none just hook her up correctly and you will be listing in no time=]                
not very sexy looking lol but the def get the job done. they really look like some speakers you would up to a regular stereo                
These monitors are probably the single worst investment I've made of any sort yet this new year. One person claimed they had too much bass, but when he plugged the ports it tightened them up. What these have, in my opinion, is a boomy replica of bass reproduction, but not actual bass. Effectively they're just a couple of tin cans that I'd return if it were worth the hassle. I'll just Craig's List 'em, take the hit and get rid of them.                
Basic; nothing more.                
I give them a (4) on this count because you have to spend an incredible amount of time trying to position them to sound well, only to find that it can't happen.                
Nothing special, but not defective at any rate.                
Total waste of money even if they were ten bucks!                
No idea.                
"I want them gone"                
They stink, basically.                
Sounds are hissing and at very low volume. All the buttons function as they should,,,, bass is very hard to hear not matter the volume. I would not buy again!! I am currently looking to Bose for their companion 3 sepakers.                
No                
Whats to learn? Plug the cord into the wall, the wall into the unit plug speaker jack into speaker and there you go. Concentrate on well built sounding product and ease will come.                
No                
Dont know have not used them                
weak.....weak.....weak!!                
hate it wish I had not bought it. Looking now for a replacement.                
You reallu cant expect the best quality.......however the sound overall is good and you basically get what you want of it                
I Must say that i am quite impressed with the features this lil thing has                
Very Very easy to use                 
Yes "this" product could'nt have been made better                   
Cant get smthng better fot the price                 
never had to deal with the company however the local music shop from where i got this were supportive                 
Quite impressive                 
As long as it lasts happily singing out beautiful tunes                 
sounds very good even at higher volumes. i use it for recording or playing backing tracks while playing thru my amp. when cranked too loaud there is some distortion but at levels just loud enough to compete with my amp levels in my house it sounds pretty good.                
if you cant figure out how to use speakers you probably cant read this review anyway                
seems to be good quality, the logos are cheesy but that is just personal preference                
cant beat the these for 65 bucks reconditioned. they looked brand new                
never used it                
really great speakers for what i do. at the levels i usually use in my house they sound really great. when you factor in the price they really cant be beat                
You get what you pay for.  These are more like mid-range computer speakers than audio monitors.  They do that duty fine.  But they are not for mixing or critical listening.  Bass is weak (I'm not looking for big bass, just a somewhat flat frequency response down to 90 Hz or so, and these definitely don't have that) and they rattle like mad at certain frequencies.                
Well, they're really cheap, so even if they don't sound good, you can use them for plenty of applications other than mixing and critical listening.                
They didn't seem to care that I was really displeased and wouldn't consider an exchange of some sort or some kind of credit.                
 Perfect sound production which you can never imagine Behringer can get this far. Hell with other BIG BRANDS when you can save hundreds and thousands by not looking at brands but listening..truthfully/.                
Best of the best                
Best                
Excellent                
No doubt i want.                
Listen and not look. MS16 is the truth to monitoring your production.                
They get excellent sound from these speakers, for the price you can't beat it $59.00 is worth every penny, I'm using these speakers w/ my  cry baby 535Q wah & my zoom GFX-8 pedal lines run straight out of the GFX-8 L/R jacks into the L/R RCA's & it makes these speakers sound like a full blown stack even at loud levels I thought they would distort like crazy once I turned them up I was wrong it sounded even better like an amp being turned up with plenty of practice volume also can pacth my sound into the mixer w/ the supplied cable & record my sound I hardly use my amp after buying these                 
no                
This is worth every penny & I wouls replace it if it stays the same price you can't go wrong for the price of these speakers                
The stereo separation is excellent. I've still not tried turning the volume higher than 5. At that volume, there was no audible distortion. This is something that separates these speakers from others I've used. I'm so impressed. I would recommend setting the treble to 4 and the bass to 3.                
The mixing features look to be quite useful, but at this point, I have only used the Digital -in (spdif) - which is a feature I love.                
If you're using spdif, make sure to switch to it, as the default on my speakers was optical. Very easy to setup.                
Excellent quality. I was really surprised.                
I think these speakers are worth much more than what they sell for. If I had known how good they'd be, I would have bought them years ago.                
Have not had to contact them                
These are nice looking speakers. They look like near field speakers that cost hundreds more.                
I've wanted these speakers for years. The idea of being able to use spdif from my sound card directly to speakers always seemed like a great idea, so I finally bought them. When I took them out of the box I was surprised at how solid they were. Hooking them up was a snap, and when I turned them on and slowly turned up the sound, I was totally amazed. Beautiful full spectrum sound! Even at 20 watts, the volume at 2 is plenty at night and is full and convincing even at such a low setting. It's true that the sound is a bit tinny unless you add some bass.                
Very detailed, superb sound for such small monitors. I found both highs and lows adequate for the purpose - you are not trying to shake the walls of your house and make your neighbors aware of your new sound system. It is a pair of NEAR FIELD monitors and they do what they are designed to do perfectly. Some users may not fully enjoy these classy speakers because of the inferior analog output of the computer and cheap wires. Also, if you are listening to a low-quality MP3 files with bit rates lower than 192kb or such, you'll hear all the sound compression defects - do not blame your speakers then!                
Volume and bass- treble controls come in handy.                
This 100$ product as well as similar Maudio monitors is way way better then anything that you can buy for your computer in a Circuit City within 400$                
I am not a professional, nor even a particularly advanced amateur, so I may not be the most reliable witness if you want to know about the accuracy of these monitors.  That said, I like them very much.  They seem well built.  The construction is solid and the knobs are smooth and well dampened.
There is a slight hiss, but at a normal distance it is indiscernible unless you have a dead silent room.  If this is a serious problem for you, you probably won't find what you need in this price range.
I have found the 20W to be plenty of power.  They would easily fill a large room.                
These monitors seem to pump out too much bass when the EQ's are set to default. I guess if you listen to hip-hop that is ideal. I usually have the bass knob at about 10 o'clock, and the treble knob at about 2. Otherwise they are loud enough for 10 watts each. They sound awesome when I play my keyboard through them, especially piano. They have a good range, and definitely plenty of bass.                 
I know I should give it a 10, but it doesn't have mid-range EQ's. I realize it's only $100, but that would have been nice. I like the SPDIF ins and outs, and having 2 inputs is a plus. They don't cause a noticeable interference if you place them within a reasonable distance from your computer monitor. Mine are about 3 to 4 inches away on either side.                
How hard is it to adjust volume, bass and treble?                
These things seem heavy duty. I'm sure they will last longer than I have a need for them.                
I'm loyal to Behringer products because of their quality and value, so for the price I don't know if these can be beat.                
I haven't needed to contact them.                
Out of all the studio monitors in this range, I personally think these look a LOT better than any others. I like the sleek black with the white ring around the cone of the bass speakers. It makes my home studio look that much more professional, whereas some others look cheap and child-like.                
I cannot compare these to other monitors in this range, but I am more than satisfied with the quality, and I will only upgrade when I need more volume and more accurate sound reproduction from professional studio monitors.                
Crisp, well defined sound for such small, self-amplified, speakers. I bought them to replace some older stand-alone computer speakers and the Behringer MS20 are so much better.  A perfect match for my home computer set up with limited desk space.                
I've yet to purchase an optical digital cable.  So far I've only used RCA analog cables and the unit sounds great.                
There wasn't much of a learning curve. For me, the ability to instantly adjust the bass and treble are the major benefit.  I can quickly adjust the speaker from voice only or internet radio live stream to DVD movies or CD audio. Living in a small apartment, I do use the front head phone jack, which is well placed for my use.                
Speaker cabinets are made of dense MDF wood rather than plastic.                  
Everything seems to be well made for this price point.                
My PC, keyboad, mouse and monitor are black.  So, the speaker cabinets look great.                  
The sound of these speakers is great. Very clear and allot of seperation. the are the clearest pair of speakers I have. They shoould be they are reference monitors.                
Digital in and analog in are great.Each with it's own volume knob. perfect                
They are speakers. Plug in and go                
Very nice enclosures. Speakers are well made.                 
Can't beat the price on these.                
I don't know. Never had to contact Behringer on any of the products I own. That's great!                
I want it? I have em. Nuff said                
I bought these for my home studio. I needed clear audio for recording. These are great. The bass sound and tweets are great. I recommend these to anyone looking for good near field's.                
for its size and price, i think these are awesome reference speakers. they might be a little small sounding but they have a flat response for critical mixing.                
Better than I expected - 5.0                
More than I need - 5.0
Plug and play - 5.0                
Good, solid construction - 5.0                
Excellent - 5.0                
Have not needed - 5.0                
They look impressive on the desk - 5.0                
I have had powered monitor speakers on my "someday" list for years. I use headphones while I do my audio work, but I sometimes need to play my results for others. I have my computer hooked into my component stereo for when I need to do that. But I have always hoped to some day have a nice pair of powered computer monitors. Of course I've used the cheap ones that sound, well, cheap. So that's why I plug my computer at home into my stereo.
It wasn't until I got involved in video production that I found what I was looking for in the MS20 pair, which was part of a Mac workstation that had been assembled as the best possible solution with a practical budget in mind. The CPU had to be high-end, and for running FCP, a powerful Mac was a given. The people that put together the workstation decided to have powered computer monitors in the Mac alcoves, rather than the headphones that were supplied at the PC workstations in a row on an open counter.
I was skeptical, because price-wise, Behringer is not high-priced gear. But uality-wise, I have always found their products quite competitive at any price. It's as if the product development team at Behringer actually get out and use the gear they produce. Imagine that! But I digress. If you are looking for high-end home theater 
sound, the MS20 may leave you wishing for more. But if you are used to listening to your work on typical computer speakers, you are in for a pleasant surprise.
If you need to fill a cubicle-size room with good sound, get the MS20 and you're set. If you need to fill a classroom or a lecture hall on a regular basis, you might need to spend more and get the MS40. It all depends on your listening environment.
Most of the time I am on headphones when I do my editing. I seldom need to play my work for more than a few people at a time. My position in the video production team is usually audio. At home, my MS20 monitors are used to give room sound to an audio production setup where I feed a keyboard into a multi-track digital recorder. It's nice to hear what I have done before I import it into the computer for further editing.                
Great connectivity, good looking speakers, crisp sound.
I use them connected to the optical out on my Apple TV 2 to replace the average sound from my bedroom TV
Also used with my computer and iPhone
Plenty of base and good value                
Optical in                
Good quality construction                
Sound is great except you cant turn the volume up past 1 without the speakers whistling and burping at high pitched squeeking and shaking.                
NA                
Easy.                
Replace immediately.                
These speakers (Behringer MS20) sound like someone with nasal speech who has just inhaled some helium. The sound was slightly less irritating with the BASS dialed to about 8 pm and the TREBLE to 9 pm. I received them yesterday, but they are going back ASAP.                
No complaint here. Good features with digital and analogue inputs and headphone out.                 
Straightforward, quite easy to use.                
Very low-quality drivers. Can't tell about the electronics. These don't seems to be designed like some of the more expensive "monitors" (no active crossover), which is expected at this price.                
Cheap, but don't deliver where it matters - the sound. In the end you get far less than what you paid for.                
Don't know.                
No, I don't want them.                
I am returning them right away.                
I was getting Some Monitors for my little home studio and heard great things about behringer. So I got some affordable monitors the MS20. I hooked up my Mp3 player and played a deep house song, I was impressed the Bass reproduction. And on a progg metal song I heard Some sounds Ive never hear on my $600 stereo.                 
I like the selection of inputs                
I set it up in about 60 seconds, Just push (power) and select the desired volume.
Simple                 
The Frame Is very solid and well constructed.                
YES ! for a hundred bucks this thing is probley the best for a little home studio.                 
never neded any                
Sounds are Incredably detailed and so simple and straight forward and packs more power then I thought.                 
Powerful and expressive monitors for my home computer audio studio. I connect to my Creative X-Fi sound card's digital out with a coaxial cable into the SPDIF jacks on the MS40s. I was blown away when I first listened. The response is amazing, from the lowest volume levels to pretty high power. I usually run my volume control about 1/3 with plenty of sound and headroom. It was the price that attracted me to these beauties but I cant imagine I would need anything bigger or pricier for my setup. If you want the best for your computer studio, get these amazing sounding monitors, and they look very cool too.                
I bought because of the digital input. I have used both analog and digital and to my ear there is little difference, but I like the idea of the digital input to eliminate any possibility of hum, etc. The bass and treble controls are fine, although I usually run them flat. The up front earphone connection is very handy when my wife goes to bed and I want to work. A very cool feature is that you can input both analog and digital signals, each with its own volume control, and mix them into one sound output. I suppose you could use the earphone out to take this mixed signal somewhere else. Haven't tried this.                
Very easy to set up and control. My biggest decision was which digital connection cable to use, coaxial or optical. I went with coaxial because of its simplicity and its good track record. From what I have read, optical isn't any better, certainly in this set-up.                
Solid, speakers are very well made, amp is flawless. Nice industrial look for your studio. I wouldn't take these on the road without a good case (to protect the exposed woofer.) The wood case it a plus. Black color fits in everywhere.                
So much better than anything you will find at a computer store. Use them just for your computer speakers and you won't be sorry.                
Only on their website, which is very informative.                 
Love the look. Really adds a sense of serious music production to my home studio.                
These babies will last me for a long time. If I ever move up, I can still use them in so many ways.                
I think these speakers sound great!  They handle low and high range extremely well.  I mean for studio monitors, you don't want them to be pumping bass or sounding too tinny anyway.  You want them to be middle of the road so you can hear what the heck you're doing.  I think that these speakers give me a great idea as to what I'm doing sonically.                
Given the fact that there are so many options for connection, I think it should at least come with the basic cables for operation.  It didn't even come with the cable to connect the left & right speakers!!!! I was blown away!  All it came with was a power cord.  I had to call zZounds for a RCA speaker cord.                
Extremely easy to set up and use.  Lots of options as far as connectability; it should be possible for EVERYONE to use them with their setups.                
Extremely solid and looks great right out of the box.  You can tell it was put together by pros.  No loose knobs, switches or connections.  When bass is turned up, you can physically see the woofers expand and there's NO rattle or excessive vibration.  There is a little speaker hiss, but that's normal.  As far as my computer monitor is concerned, it's extremely close and it doesn't affect the speakers one iota.                
I think it's worth every penny, and with the free shipping you really can't go wrong.  I can't see needing anything else for a very long time!  Even if I do "upgrade", these will definately be used as a part of a future setup.                
I had to call and get a speaker wire the day that I received the speakers and they e-mailed me by that evening saying that one was being sent out.  That's my only experience thus far, but it's sure nice getting through to a person in about 1-2 minutes, especially one that isn't based in India!!!!!                
Very sexy setup.  They sit authoritatively on top of my studio desk and just beg to be used.  They want me to go all night, I say "sounds good" . . .                 
As I said above, as I continue to build my studio, these MS40's will definitely be a part of my future setups.  I can't see how they couldn't be.  I'm in love.  If I had to get replacement monitors, I'd stick with these as a replacement if they were damaged in a fire or stolen.  I wish I knew it didn't come with the speaker wire before I bought it and it would have saved me a trip to the store, but it was pretty minor.  I love the sound of them most of all.                  
This pair of NFM surprised me, I had to move from some old speakers to new monitors, I couldn't afford to change the disposition of my hi-fi speakers so I decided to buy a cheap but working pair of monitors.
These ones are really great for the money.
I mean, surely there is something better on the market, sweep test for bass frequences reveals a consistent drop around 50hz (but still moving cones at 20hz with no rattle) and some non linear behaviour, but overall the sound is really good at 50% volume and fits all your (basical) needs for monitoring a recording.
The stereo scene is really precise, I didn't need to emphasize bass or highs.                
best value for the price, I decided for them for the digital input, it's really a plus, no noise at all and really good quality on reproduction, even better than using the external soundcard on my mac and connecting it through RCA.
Surely an XLR connector could be a plus, but for my needs I loved the coax/optical input and was enough for me.
Bass/Treble controls are sensitives, good quality (as new) and nice finitures, looks really like a pro monitor.                
Very simple, connected the two speakers, the digital in and the power plug and they were running.
I put all the controls at 50% (nice feature on the bass/treble knobs is the "middle" position) and did the first soundcheck and they were great.                
These speakers LOOKS really good.
Overall they're made QUITE good, for a cheap product. Cones are in plastic but the rubber is soft and quick, knobs are well built and the overall looking seems solid and semi-pro.                
FOR THE MONEY, they're very very good.
I mean: it's useless in this product range making a comparison with the first reference speaker that costs twice and only for ONE speaker...
As a beginner speaker they give a good stereo scene reconstruction, a nice timbric representation and a good dynamic, used as monitors.
20W are perfect as a power for listening to you music at an adeguate level at a close distance, you cannot use for you home theater environment, but.. they're not made for this!                
Not needed actually                
aesthetically they're great, looks sturdy and well finished, black is a classic for speaker and the white cone is a plus (even if in plastic).
I could ask for a green / blue led instead of the red one, but no more in this class :D                
Actually I'm totally satisfied by the product and for my need of home recording in Garageband it's quite enough.
I think I'd buy again if stolen.                
 These monitors sound rather muffled in the low frequencies. There is no distinct bass punch, just sort of a low bass wash. The mids and highs didn't seem that bad. I have had good experiences with Behringer and thought I'd try these out. Great price. Great looks. Sound just wasn't that great in the lows. Also, the left speaker would buzz/rattle at certain frequencies. I'm pretty sure the woofer was hitting something behind it as it flexed.                 
 There was a good amount of features for sure. Along with the name, great looks and a great price, there was 24 bit/192 kHz D/A converters, and optical and digital coaxial inputs. There was also rca and trs inputs, bass and treble knobs, and separate volume controls for analog and digital. One thing that did surprise me was the speaker cone. From the pictures I thought it was silver metal. It is actually white plastic.                
 In all honesty, I didn't find the bass and treble controls to be very effective or responsive. Maxing out the treble knob did not seem to alter the sound all that much. The bass knob increased the muddy rumble. Other than that, two thumbs up.                 
The craftsmanship seemed great. I noticed no blemishes. The cabinet definitely seemed sturdy. The only problem, other than the sound that didn't suit my tastes, was the buzz/rattle that came from the left speaker when I was monitoring keyboard. I'm sure it was just a defect and sent them back.                 
 I wished the sound quality of these speakers was better in the low ranges so I could get another pair and have some good looking, good sounding monitors from behringer for a nice price. But, I think I'm going to look for another pair.                
 I've owned a used behringer mixer for about 4 years and have had no problems with it. In this case, it was just a slight defect that zzounds took care of. I have never had to deal with Behringer's customer support, but like I said, my experiences with the company's products have been great.                 
Sound is just not quite tight. Everything else is pretty decent.                 
Good home monitors.  A little flat on sound, you have to use DFX software (example: Stereo Tool v8.40) combined with WinAmp.  Then the sound significantly improves.                
These monitors are fine for my application.  I did purchase them for the S/PDIF interface.  The higher end higher priced systems did not have that feathure.  Knowing that my output source would be S/PDIF,  and I mainly write guitar arrangements a good mid to hight range sound would work as long as there was no buzz from the monitors and these proved to be very quite.  If you are playing MP3's based on the nature of what they are you will note the sound is sub par and the low end muffeled                  
Well I bought it for the S/PDIF input feature, but other than that nothing specail.                
Very simple to use but, they should be user friendly                
The quality of the cab looks durable.  However I would never put any type of amplified speaker in danger.  They should last as long as they are not abused.                 
No doubt these are very inexpensive, so if you are into getting just sound for little moneies, this will work.                
Have had no reason to call but from some past exsperince, Behringer techs are honest about their products and will tell you whats up.                
This is just a part of my overall setup. I hope to upgrade from these                
I will keep them until they die but I will not replace with the same. At this price and knowing that Behringer products are not really that service friendly..when they die, they die.                
Worst sounding speakers I've ever tried to like. Their sound is muddy, and when the mud is scooped out their sound is thin. They take all the enjoyment out of listening to music. The only hope of hearing anything clearly is to turn the bass all the way down, as in off. The treble then needs to be dialed in somewhere between 0 and 5 depending on the musical content. Not sure what purpose these were intended for, but they didn't cut it as studio monitors, keyboard speakers, or desktop computer speakers. They do amplify sound in stereo. I'll leave it at that. Nothing against Behringer as a whole, but this is not one of their OK products.                
I love the sound. It gives awesome quality for less the buck. The low frequencies tend to rumble a little if you bump them too hard, but it gives you plenty of bass before it rumbles. Love them! Perfect for starter home studios.                
I love the look of it!                
AS i've read many places now, the sound is very airy. High end is totally jacked on these monitors. These are not a flat response to sound.                
No real features. Multiple ins i guess make it a 4, but the sound is bad enough that it doesn't matter at all.                
They're powered monitors. They're all easy to use.                
I honestly thought these would help me move up on controlling my sound output from the AKG K240 headphones i was using prior (and now am using again), but they have failed me.                
I suppose it's worth the price. I don't know what i was thinking spending so little. Maybe they are the best bang for your buck, but they haven't helped me at all.                
No idea, doesn't matter.                
They look nice. Sound awful.                
I was satisfied for about a week and a half.                
I bought these speakers because of reading all of these other reviews; giving behringer *one* more chance to provide anything quality and to add to my repotoir of speakers and setup. But the truth is, you have to be musicly deaf to not hear that these speakers are sub average and not worth the money, even if it is cheaper; you mise as well throw your money away. The constant airy sound on top of the recording makes you feel like you are in an air plane listening to a weak recording. At 20w a speaker, it sounds more like 10w a speaker. The treble EQ barely changes anything and the bass just make it more muffled. You are paying for the sexy looks of these speakers, but definately not the sound quality.                
It allows for bass and treble EQ on the main monitor and different options for output which allows a user to use these speakers for almost any reason.                 
If you are trying to adjust your mix and speaker gains (whether its on your board, computer or interface) to get good sound out fo these speakers, don't try. It will still sound airy.                 
It is well built, didn't have problems, Behringer knobs are known for being loose with static-prone pots. But it functioned well, just the sound quality was horrible.                
These speakers are the cheapest on the market, and understandably so. I guess for the price you are paying, you get for what you pay for. But in my opinion, still not worth the value for what you spend. My reccomendation is for you to hold out and spend your money on something else.                 
I didn't need support.                 
These speakers are dangerously sexy and therefore extremely very dissapointing. The only thing i liked about these speakers is the way they look. It reminds me of one of those pimped out civics -- all show, but no go!                 
You need to ask yourself what you are buying these speakers for. If you are buying these for close field music recording/mixing, don't bother unless you want a horrible mix and you will just get frustrated on not being able to hear clearly. Although they will make your setup more secy, If its for casual listening, why don't you just buy a low end surround sound system for what you are paying this for, it will be much clearer for casual listening. Regardless, its a waste of hard earned money in my opinion. Purchase something else!                
They look cool but sound like crap...... very buzzy and junky sounding. The headphone jack on mine was plugged and can't be accessed. A total waste of money.                
I've been doing some live on-site recording at several open mics for over a year and a half with a collection of separate splitters, but just reached a limit on how quickly I could adapt to different performers' configurations; and this unit, along with a couple 8x snakes, solved my problems for what I might have spent on just a couple more separate splitters. Behringer's choice of output labeling is unusual, but once you figure it out things are fine. Oh, and watch those Link buttons - easy to accidentally press when plugging in stuff in a hurry! (I have not used/needed Berhringer support.)                
For the price (and size), this little contraption has god-like sound quality.                 
It's a 4-channel mixer. If you've looked at the pictures, its pretty basic. 4 inputs, 4 volumes, 1 output.                
Plug and Go...how much easier does it get?                
Extremely sturdy casing, REAL METAL, not that BS plastic crap. As stated in another review, the knobs would be the first to go, but I opened it up and looked at the circuitboard...they're pretty well anchored in there.                
I have a USB interface for recording, and I bought this for drum mics, and it really does what I bought it for. Once you get up above 5 channels, the prices skyrocket with added features that I'd never need (thanks to Adobe Audition), so this is precisely what I looked for.                
Our bassist has a Behringer Bass Amp, and that thing (literally) rattles the house we play in. Behringer is one of the few companies that make legitimately quality products for the right price. Good Job Behringer!                
Rugged, streamline, simple. It's not as big as it looks. its about the size of 2 cell phones stacked on top of each other, so people who like compact devices, get one. Oh, and...this thing is SEXAAAY!                
Reliable, consistent functionality for cheap. Isn't that what business competition is all about? It might not have built-in EQ or effects or all those, but I do that on our band's PC, so all I needed was something to mix the drums right without having to record 4 separate tracks. If all you need is something small to say, bring a singer's voice over a screamer's, and into only one PA Amp, this would work. $30 is pretty much a bargain for this, I've seen 2-channel mixers over 5x the price, and they're bulkier too. So if you just need a simple mixing solution, this is the way to go.                
I have a nice amp but it only has 1 input and I usually play with another guitar or two and a singer. This little box solves everything for me. I can put any combination of instruments and mics into this and have it work everytime. One really big amp is all that's really needed in most of the places I play. (beaches, backyards, small houses....) The thing is tough too. I was run over once and still kept on going.It's not waterproof though. I lost channel 1 because it got dunked in a kiddie pool. For sure I'm going to get another on to replace it                
Clean, accurate, transparent... all the things you want in a mixer.                
Not many features - four volume knobs, that's pretty much it! But that's exactly what I wanted.                
Good knob design makes the settings easily visible, and smooth controls makes this a simple and easy mixer                
Rugged case gives me no worries. I suppose the knobs might break if I abused this little box, but I'm not worried about tossing it into a case with foot pedals and the like.                
Outstanding value. Just as simple as I want, for a VERY reasonable price.                
(no experience)                
I'm a mobile DJ and needed to have 2 (or more) mics to go through my controller, but it only has one mic input. This little box allowed my to hook up my corded mic for myself and a wireless mic (for audience members) and be able to control them through the one input. EXACTLY what I need. And the price was PERFECT. Everything else I was looking at was $60-$100. (those items did more functions, but I needed something simple). Hooked it up, tested it and it works just like I needed. Great to have individual channel volumes too!                
I am a motorcyclist.  I have three imput devices that I need to listen to through one set of ear buds.  The imput is from a radar detector, xm radio, and cb radio.  I do not have nor need a gps, but if I did, I could listen to it through the MX 400.  The quality of the music from the xm reciever is excellent.                
Being abble to control the volume of each input device, allows me to control which device to have "on top".  At times the radar detector "reports" the presence of McDonalds or a Micro Wave tower.  The Micro Wave tower can cause the radar detector to go off for minutes at a time and it can be truned down while maintaining the music at appropricat levels.                
Plug the devices in and go.                
The device seems indistructable.  I went on an 11,000 mile trip and the MX 400 never gave me a problem.  I whish I could say the same about the devices I connected to the MX 400.                
I have seen other multi imput single output devices used by Motorcyclists that cost 5 times as much and only had one main volume control.                
Haven't needed any.                
I will never regret the purchase of the MX 400 and continue to use it to listen to FM radio and the radar detector at the same time.                
I bought these without hearing them first, based on the surprisingly low price, and good reviews of other Behringer models, and I am bowled over! They are the primary speakers in my home entertainment system, replacing some rather bulky floor standing speakers which were getting tired. As soon as I fired them up I was grinning like a fool. Very detailed and punchy, they breathed new life into audio CDs and movies alike. I have them connected via XLR cables to my Emotiva digital processor/preamp and they are happy to flatten my whole living room with sound when cranked! Way better than a $400 pair of speakers should be, and the adjustments are easy to use and fine tune. You won't be disappointed.                
One word 'WOW'!  I use this for my mobile system for deejaying events and it added that extra punch. Just what I needed, crisp sound and nice build quality! The price for this you can't beat! I definitely recommend this product.                 
Awesome little mixer. I bought this to expand my power amp options down the road; was pleasantly surprised that this mixer has breathed new life into my stereo system and double its sound quality all for $89.95.                 
Very nice easy setup gets the job done.                
I use a wall wart to power my pedals (9 of them) I added the noise reducer to knock out the non isolated hum from my pedals and it works wonders. It has a complete mute setting that totally kills the signal or a reducer setting ( that I use) . People complain about Behringer pedals dying from being stomped on too much, but you wont have to worry about that with this one. You'll always want this pedal on. I use it in line with some notoriously noisy effects including the Mxr Blue Box, Phase 90, a ZVEX Box of Rock, A EHX LPB-1, and a Big Muff. This is a true value. If you're killing buzz on a budget this pedal is for you. It is also AMAZING compared to the Rocktron Hush. The hush humed and buzzed like crazy so I returned it and got this pedal.                 
This is the 3rd noise gate - 3rd company I have tried.
All were quickly returned, except this one.
The NR300 works as advertised.
Does not kill your tone.
Being able to run the insturment in and then all the effects into this pedal before going into the amp via different inputs is great.
It removed all the noise from the pedals as well as pickup noise.
I used a disgram from another brand to see the best/quickest way to set this up. This works like a pedal costing $100.00 more.
With ZZSounds return policy you have nothing to lose.                
Great pedal and inexpensive.
Always on now that I own it.                
Controles are as simple as they come.                
Looks great, bright indicator lights,                
Works as advertised.
The only one I have not sent back.
$100.00 saved over a bigger brand name.                
No need.                
Looks great.
The Blue and Red indicators are easily seen.                
This is a keeper.                
Normally you get what you pay for, but this is a steal.  It takes a little tweaking, but this definitely takes the hiss out of my pedals.  I am amazed at the price and how good a job this pedal does.                
Just got this and hooked it up to my pedal board. It immediately took out the hum of a single coil. That is what I wanted it for, it can be tweaked to eliminate all kinds of noise & hum.                 
I bought this pedal and it sounded terrible.  I was going to throw it away, when a buddy looked at it for me.  He found one of the wires coming from the battery (the positive) barely connected.  once fixed, it is awesome.                
this is the worst thing I have ever spent money on. I have tinkered with this paperweight for hours and it sounds terrible.                
Great power distribution hub. We have 3 of these at our church now and they've been working flawlessly for several months. Great product for the price.                
Our church now has eleven P16-M Personal Mixers. When connected to our Behringer X32 Mixer via the P16-D distribution module, no external power is needed. It is provided over the Ethernet connection. The price and functionality can't be beat.                
Sound doesn't apply to a pedalboard, but it does the job to augment your sound, so I give it a 10 by default.                   
I liked the included AC adapter and chain to save you money on powering the pedals.  I also liked the way everything was neatly put together, but if you have odd shaped pedals, you'll have to find a way to make things fit and that can be somewhat of a nightmare.  I would have also liked it if they had included velcro tape to make everything stay in place.                  
It's simple to put down and start making your chain.  Even if you have to move pedals around, it doesn't take much to set it in a new location.                  
It is a cheaper pedalboard made of hard plastic so don't expect this thing to take 20 foot drops. That being said, it does keep your stuff protected when closed and even though it won't take much in terms of pressure, falls, or physical force it will at the very least keep your stuff together, organized, and safe from the elements.                   
Well worth the price tag, a good buy if you're looking for a pedal board that won't break the bank.                  
This area is non applicable since I haven't had a need to contact them.                  
It is a nice looking pedalboard even though it has giant BEHRINGER logo etched on the outside.  That isn't to say Behringer is a bad company, but it would have looked better with something more subtle.                  
I plan to keep this until I either run out of room or have the money for a professional quality true bypass Pedalboard.  Till then, this will serve me well for the weekend gigs and anything else I play.                  
I bought this pedalboard case in order to simplify my set ups. This case enables me to show up to my gig, connect my bass to it, connect power, connect the amp, and done. When it's time to go, just reverse the order, pop the lid back on, and byebye! The case itself is a hard plastic material, which appears durable but only a few months down the road will tell for sure. The case is lined with foam padding on the lid, and a dense foam material on the base side. I removed the thumb screws (loved that it has thumb screws for everything) and removed the foam cut outs, then lined the remaining pads with double sided tape so they'd stay in place without the screws.  I then threw down a couple strips of velcro and I magically had a pedalboard case that could suit my needs. For the price, it's really difficult to beat all that this pedalboard case is and what comes with it.
Now the stuff I really like about this pedalboard case. I really like that it comes with enough patch cables to set up 12 pedals. I also really like that it comes with a built in power supply unit capable of supporting 12 pedals via daisy chain. Lastly but most importantly I also like that it has these ports built into it so that I can set up my pedals and have it ready for a show without having to do anything else other than hooking up my bass to it, hooking up the power adapter, and hooking up the amp.
The one con which I accepted was how large it is. When I bought it I was under the impression it was smaller. The pro to this is that even though the image shows 12 pedals, you have a lot of real estate an enough room to stick up 20 pedals easily!                
Love it-perfect for boss pedals. I have also managed to fit a small Wah pedal in one of the slots by cuttin the foam a bit-not a rocket since..the included patch cords are ok but I did replace them to a pro level cables. The ac adapter has been been upgraded to a GODLIKE 2.5 Amp-quiet!This is a Very sturdy case that will protect your beloved pedals. The latches are prone to break so treat them gently without bumping them into a hard matter. Overall-well worth it!                
I have had this Board for about 3 months now and still use it! Its an amazing board COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE! made of super strong grade plastic and was crafted very well.  The only problems I had with this board was the daisy chain and patch cables that came with the board were complete trash.  Caused constant humming and buzzing (ground looping).  However, i upgraded my power supply to a one-spot daisy chain and bought brand new patch cables and this pedal board is wonderful! I gig 4-5 times a week and this is my main board and it has held up wonderfully! I have heard stories about the latches breaking however i have not had an issue with them yet.  Overall great board just upgrade the power supply and patch cables!                 
Used for keyboards and the only trouble was I had to get a 12 volt power supply for the fcv100 there's two of them one for organ one for synth

keep my stuff in place and iks easy to change around                
I may get another one for bass but i don't need that much room. PB600?                
I have a mixer that is constantly needing to be fixed.Haven't had that problem with other brands before?                
not under warr.                
Your sound depends on the settings of your pedals.  My guitar can sound as it's in a small room or a big hall.  Depends on how my pedals are set, and how I chain them.  I use Digitech pedals: Reverb, chorus, delay, flange, Ibanez tube screamer, Korg tuner.  The daisy chain also leaves an extra input for my Cry Baby.  How full the sound gets depends on how you tweak your pedals 
The power supply is invaluable.  You would be going to the store non-stop for batteries.  
Stomp boxes eat batteries like my kids eat cereal.                 
The PB600 is much easier than the PB1000 I bought.  The PB1000 was set up backwards.                
The unit is simple to operate. Remember though, pedal sizes vary.  The foam in the PB600 is designed for Behringer pedals.  As I said, I have Digitech pedals. I used an X-acto knife to fit them in tightly(took 10 minutes).  The foam is screwed in so you can easily remove it to meet your needs.  Close it up until the next time you're ready to play.                
Whether you are active, hobbyist, or undecided, you should have one these.   It will organize your gear on-stage, get the boxes out of your wife's way or make you sell that guitar you got for Christmas.                
Should have called them on the PB1000                
Black resin didn't seem sexy to me this morning, and still isn't.                
I'll use it until I, or someone I know, decides the piece of equipment  isn't important.  So, it will be a long time.                
I play a Carvin guitar, currently through five pedals, into a Vox VT+ series amplifier. I notice no degradation in sound quality, hiss, noise, hum or other interference.                
Rubber footed "base" keeps board from sliding on most surfaces. Interior areas are expandable to include larger wah pedals, or custom sized pedals if needed. You will need to remove / add foam or inserts to secure larger or smaller pedals. Also, nothing moves once the case is closed and sliders are locked. Nice tight fit around pedals and components, travels well.                
Case packs up quick, keeps everything neat and does not take up that much of a footprint in small clubs or limited spaces.                
As an adult gigging guitar player, playing about two shows a month, I can not think of a way you could damage this board. Something not mentioned often is how the board "looks" professionally. I do not mean the Behringer name (which I have no issue with) but as a performer getting paid for a gig or function. The board presents a clean, uniform look for your effects, and keeps all of the wires and "spaghetti" cleaned up and pro looking. I watched countless videos about building your own pedal board, with drywall screws, velcro tape, cords and lights everywhere and at the end it weighs 50 pounds, looks like a soap box race car without wheels and costs twice as much. Guitar projects are great, and a lot of fun. I wish I had the abilities of the guys who can build and wire their own boards. I don't. This is a great alternative, and presents a nice image if your in a church band, function band, or night club.                
Yes. I viewed it this way:Board: $50Adapter and Daisy Chain: $25.00Shipping: $25.00This board arrived in a large, professionally packed box.                
I have not dealt with Behringer. I have interacted with zzounds on several occasions, all positive.                
The board is lightweight, has a solid feel and construction and fits six Behringer, or Boss shaped pedals with no modification to interior foam. Power supply, daisy chain, patch cables, free shipping? Great deal.                
This pedal board came out of the box ready to use and with patch cables and power for 7 effects. It took me less than 30 minutes to make my pedal board ready to play. Foam is already cut for Behringer or Boss sized effects. But can be easily sized for larger or smaller sized effects.                 
I wanted to put a pedal board together and on a budget. So budget and Behringer go together always. You can tell that a lot of thought went in to this product. This is an all in one pedal board that comes complete with everything you need to start your chain. The coolest thing about this is that it is already pre-wired for you. You plug into the board and not into the pedals themselves. There is also a area for you to hide your daisy chain for power making this a very clean looking area. While I don't use a waw pedal you can even make an area for that. There is also 6 jumper cables for your six pedals. All in all this is like all Behringer products a good dollar value with lots of features. I was able to buy this pedal board and 6 Behringer pedals and got away for under $250.00.                 
Purchased this from zZounds.  Received it in two days in California.
The board is wonderful.  I have all Boss & Behringer effects and they fit perfectly in the box.  The wire management is quite good and everything is really neat when installed properly.  I no longer have effects boxes sliding around the floor.  It's the best $99 I've spent in a long time.  The power supply is quiet and adds no Power Line artifacts to my audio guitar signal.  At 170 MA it's very suitable for a six position pedal board.
This pedalboard is so good for the money                 
Not a sound producing item                
Includes the power adaptors and patch cables.  Would like velcro also, but that's easy to find locally.                
Pretty intuative.  Arrange your pedals, plug them up and secure the loose cables in the track.  Makes for a neat, relatively uncluttered apearance.  Close it up, and carry it like a suitcase.                
Great board.  Patch cables are entry level, but work fine.                
Including the power adapter and patch cables make this a great value.                
Have not dealt with manufacturer.                
Probably not as cool as a custom one or some of the other, more expensive ones, but I can't play that well anyway.                
I have purchased(2) of these Behringer PMP1680S Powered Mixers since January of this year, and "I Really Love Them"...I run a Karaoke and Dj service that has gigs 4 nights a week(each show is around 5 hours in length) and Im a musician in a gigging band 1 night on the weekend, so I really give these 2 Powered Mixers a workout, and they have performed Flawlessly! This thing really puts out some power and it sounds great..This amp is very light weight, has very quiet Mic Outs, has built in eq's,dual effects, is rack mountable, and Sounds better and has More Power than a lot of the "High Dollar" Brands out there at about half the cost! I am able to do everything from running sound for my 5 piece Blues Band (4 mics,Keys,laptop,monitors,mains) to Djing/Karaoke (4 mics, laptop,mains, subs,and monitor for karaoke)..This thing has met my expectations and more, Its a compact solution for someone like my self who loves to Play/Make Music but hates to lug around huge racks of gear for gigs..This thing sounds great, and the Price is Phenomenal!!!Zzounds has given me great service, and fast delivery on every purchase that i have made from them, and they will beat a competitors price if you find it cheaper at another online music store! Thats why i wont buy music gear from anyone but Zzounds..                
I LOVE BEHRINGER! I wish they would endorse me!! 
I recently purchased the Behringer EUROPOWER PMP1680S 1600-Watt 10-Channel Powered Mixer with Dual Multi-FX Processor and FBQ Feedback Detection System, and I can't tell you how much I LOVE this unit!
I talked to U.S. South East. reps at Behringer before I made my purchase and told them how much I would promote this company if it was everything they said it was. They did not disappoint. I am a veteran musician and have shared the stage with many Multi-Platinum Hard Rock and Alternative bands from Blue Oyster Cult to Collective Soul, so I know what I am talking about when it comes to sound and quality. 
Here is what I found, comparing this unit while performing with my 3 piece acoustic band, and mind you, we don't have a live drummer. 
These comparable systems, which are much more expensive, I either own or have used. 
The Yamaha 1200 watt unit, I own,  has 2 matched mains and monitors, and clips like mad when trying to push it for more volume. During an outside performance, my former sound man, who was there with his gear, insisted tethering off our main out, to his gear, because we weren't being heard well about 100' out. He broke out his Behringer 1200W amp and 2 Behringer 15" mains between our 1st & 2nd set. 
This would be my first encounter with this company's equipment and I was so blown away by the sound quality difference, that it got me seriously looking at Behringer. Thanks Butch! You ROCK! 
Mackie's 1200 watt unit, which I did not get to push, as it was inside gig and not mine, performed well but had "powered" matched mains and 12" wedges, which if you have a few grand laying around, sure you can have something that sounds like that, but it still only had one effect processor and not as many bells and whistles as the Behringer, even though it's highly regarded as industry standard.
Now for the Behringer: WOW!! But first,  A BIG shout out to Zzounds.com, from where I made my purchase!! Every struggling artist who wants pro gear, but does not have the bulk cash to buy it, needs to know about this site and their (Pay as you Play) NO INTEREST policy, using your debit card. Look into it if you haven't already! I LOVE this store, and they will beat any advertised site on the net. I've tried it and they came through. SUPER fast "FREE" ground shipping too!! 1 to 3 days! AWESOME!!! www.Zzounds.com 
OK back to my review: I wanted to see JUST how much I could push this unit, as it comes with a 30 day FULL money back warranty from Zzound, SO during a large event, I hooked this bad boy to a pair of Mackie 15" S500 passive mains, a set of 12" 500W passive mains and a set of Carvin 15" wedges, cranked it about 1/2 way and HOLY S#@% was it AWESOME! 4 hour show and not one clip or problem from this great little unit. 
This performance was at the Brookhaven Amphitheater at Bald Hill on Long Island, N.Y. and I can't begin to tell you, the clear, warm and LOUD, sound was just amazing!! We received so many compliments on how good it sounded from 40 to hundreds of feet away! ALL for UNDER $500!? They even threw in a free set of 25' ""SPEAKON" cables!   
Oh yeah, I'm a fan, now if I can only get that endorsement deal.......
Check out our orig / cover band, Mojo Wire, at www.MojoWireRocks.com or just take a listen to my 1st release "Save Me" from my upcoming album " The Darker Side of Light" right here on Indaba!

Haven't needed yet                
I play acoustic/electric and I feel the sound is a bit too "electric like" when playing with direct input.  But, mic-ing my acoustic amp produces an excellent sound.                
I wish it had a direct out for digital data, and also more effect processors with ability to switch around on the fly.  I know these changes would increase the price.                 
I barely had to look at the manual.                
Very well thought out design.                
Haven't needed any.                
Highly recommended                
Highly recommended                
I just bought the behringer 1680 power mixer and love it. It has GREAT power and works great for outside shows. When its time to upgrade it will be another behringer thats all i i have ever owned.  
I like the Fx it has                
Great! I set it just like i had my old behringer set and no need to change anything just tweek it here and there if needed                
Light To Carry And Never Worry About It Letting Me Down.                 
Compared to other brands the quality is well worth the price. Ive uses pevey in the past and this 1680 will perform as well or better for less money.                
Zzounds is Great And Answer any ? you Have                
it looks attractive.                
When behringer up grades the 1680 to something equal to it i will replace it.                  
Pleased with it in every way shape and form. Put it to the test in a live 5 piece band. Never had a worry with it. Can't beat the sound, the price, the look and all the features it has. Would recommend this to all looking for quality Pa system. Rock On my friends                
Cant go wrong with this mixer! Good power. The effects are second to none. Our drums sound killer mic'ed into this along with bass and guitar. Has enough headroom for our singer to shine!                
Great sound no feed back I would recommend  this product more bang for the buck best value..                
Fantastic for small medium venues.  Voice cancellation works to remove 90% of vocals.  Powerful output too.  I use out puts to a monitor amp for on stage monitoring.  All works flawlessly.  Much light to carry as well.                
Does what ever you ask and then some. Easy to work with and very quiet. I had a bit of a humming noise when hooked up to my laptop. Installed a ground effects isolator and now it's perfect. Great for small or medium sized rooms. No cons so far.                
I bought a Berringer 1680s 3 yrs ago and it was an awesome mixer. Performed extremely well. Sadly to say, it got fried during a lightning storm. I got a replacement and it worked very well. My wife was using the replacement mixer when the sound went out and all the lights started flashing. I called the co. and they told me the unit was not covered under the warranty because the warranty was covered under the 1st unit that was fried. I had this unit only 7months and no warranty on it. NOT acceptable. I believe that any new unit should have the warranty upon the date you purchased it regardless if it is a replacement or not.....it is still "supposed" to be new. I am not pleased with the Co. policy for this unit.                
I recently purchased another Beringer PMP1680s Powered Mixer from Zzounds ...I already own one of these,  but, I liked it so much that I decided to buy another one for my other(2nd) Karaoke/DJ system...The 1680s sounds great, has cool features( eq, dual effects, feedback locator, 10 channels, and very quiet Mic Outs) ..I use my 1680s every weekend for my Karaoke/DJ Show, I t has worked Flawlessly! I have received several compliments on my sound from patrons at the Club where I play..I am really pleased with this Powered Mixer, lots of power and options at a great price, what's not to like, and Zzounds service and delivery is fantastic...                
I recently got my Beringer PMP 1680S Powered Mixer that I had ordered from Zounds..It sounds fantastic and has lots of features (Dual Effects) it is simple to set up and use and the new design is lighter and it looks pretty cool also..Compared to my last 2 powered mixers( Peavey  and Yamaha) this thing sounds better, has more power and is a real bargain..Zzounds is just an Awesome Online Music Store, I found a cheaper price at a competitor, and Zzounds beat it, and I received my Mixer in 4 days from time of order, with free shipping..I won't shop anywhere else, great service, fast delivery!                 
The Behringer PMP1680S Powered Mixer is a piece of junk.  I had it for two months and it stopped working.  Don'y waste your time and hard earned money on this product!                
Received this unit and Power a massive Peavey Speaker Array, in a 40 by 80 garage. Clean, crisp power with awesome effects. Hook your phone or ipad dial your favorite songs, sit back ad relax. Have miked the lead guitar, base, drums, and B3 up - blown it through the Peavey array with 4 vocal mikes - the Behringer PMP2000 brought it!!!                
I paired this with a pair of Peavey PV215  speakers and I've only setup in my basement for four piece classic rock band. I planned on using mainly as a practice P.A. so we could leave the gigging P.A. packed until needed as it is alot of work setting up and tearing down. First off setup and dialing this system in is very easy and fast. I found a clear sound with more than enough bottom for our needs . There's enough inputs for bass , guitar , drums and three vocals. I'm sure that this very small system could cover most bars we will book. I'm surprised that this setup isn't shown as a pre-packaged system . My initial thoughts are this unit is a home run for us , time will tell how durable it is but so far clean , powerful and easy sums it up.                
It is A Awesome  MIXER/BRAIN. very powerful, and the pay as you go plan is awesome too, i have had only one product damaged and the return policy is super easy,  i have used zZounds For Years and will continue to use them also.. do not hesitate on buying this mixer it is worth every penny you spend on it.. Buy it..                 
I like the power and and the simplicity . I use with a pair of PV 215 speakers and i feel the sound I get is great . My intention when i bought it was to keep it in my jam room and be able to have practices and or jams / parties and for this it's more than i need. I play cd's and my smart phone through it and it's awesome to practice on my own with. I don't intend on taking it in and out of my basement ,( speakers are kinda heavy ) it's a luxury for me . I'm sure it would be fine in most places I would play . I have only had it about 6 months but no issues . I'm happy for the money and I want to thank zZounds for the pay as you play program .                
Downsized from all the amps mixers ect bought this unit and a pair of Peavey Speakers and wow Talk about a match made from heaven. and yes there is a monitor out On back left side becomes monitor and right side is the mains                   
Before buying this unit be aware that there are no monitor outputs on this unit even though there is a separate EQ section for monitors and a separate monitor volume level for each channel. It's fine as a straight mixer with the 2 main outputs but I expected a separate monitor out especially since it has all the controls for it. I called Behringer and asked them how to hook up the monitors and they said it's not possible. Major disappointment in this design of this mixer and am returning it for one that has the outputs that match the controls.                
2 years on straight and still works for bar application controlling live sound satellite radio and internet jukebox. people have told me don't buy this brand it will break. NOPE after leaving it on for 2 years straight im waiting lol. i'm buying a backup as we speak so when this one does decided to take a break, the new one will go into service while the other one is on temporary vacation.                
I got this to DJ/KJ at several bars and clubs and private gigs all over the east coast. I got it to replace a Samson 500 Watt mixer. I use a pair of Yamaha club series and a pair of Sound Tech with 15" and horns. I also run an iNuke 6000d on a pair of MTX 12" subs... The Samson always ran out of power but this one... WOW... It's not as clean as the Samson, but it is TONS more power. It is def. clean enough, and I have DJed places lately that have taken bands off the schedule every night I can take, all because of how I sound, and rock the house. I DO run an external EQ because the on board is just not enough for me but that is all... The effects are good too...                
This Power Mixer soudns Fantastic for the DJ on the go and works great in the studio as well,                 
Could use an USB in/output                
I would by another for sure.                
I am satisfied with my Behringer mixing board. Great sound, nicely portable with built in handle, 100 fx presets, built in voice canceler for vocal practice and karaoke. Now this is my first board so I don't have a lot of experience, however , I was so excited when I got it, already had mics, speakers, stands, instruments etc. first thing I did was rip it open and set it up. But to my surprise the speaker outputs were neither 1/4 inch jacks or low impedance jacks so I grabbed the phone and called a few different music stores before I called Guitar Center who had adapters for $20 a piece. So I had to jump in the car and drive half An hour to buy them then half an hour back. Now for the most part the board works like most but there are a few advanced gadgets. Have fun looking in the Manual for any assistance because it would be better used as toilet paper! Sure there are diagrams on how to hook it up a few different ways but not much more. In fact there are 25 titled fx presets printed right on the board but god forbid they could have listed the other 75 in the Manuel!
Don't get me wrong, once you learn and memorize the features of the board it's an excellent piece of equipment. I am curious as to why you have to practical max out the main and channel volumes to get where you need to be.                
More than pleased, run a karaoke show and I can make em sound like rock stars, amp pushes 4 15" speakers with ease, and can make the windows shake, sound much better than the self powered set-ups                
top notch mixer for all needs                
As described. No issues. Works great. A perfect mixer for DJ, light ensemble, karaoke. Plenty of power.                
I have a Mackie PPM1012 and bought this as a second mixer. It is a decent mixer. Power is good, sound is good and I am able to work with it just fine. Better signal lights would be nice, and a lamp would be great. The Speak-On plugs are nice but a pain at the same time. I still prefer my Mackie over this but for the money it is a decent mixer and have no problem recommending it to people, but would say it is better if you have some experience.                 
Good quality, size and mixer power rating was listed in product description.                
Overall a decent bag. Would be nice if they included some dense foam to take up space to keep mixer from moving around.                
I am not going to go into a huge review on this mixer. But I am a fan of Behringer products. Own this mixer and very nice Bass amp. This mixer is very nice.
1. Controls are very smooth and not touchy.
2. Learning curve is great. I was not looking for a over complicated mixer and this one is great.
3. Sound is very crisp and clear of ANY noise. I have not even had to use the noise cancellation thing at all.
4. Effects have great options to adjust all of them to your liking.
5. Unit is very compact but extremely high quality. 
6. This is for my studio I have not played out with it yet. But it would make your ears bleed in the studio.
zZounds:
Their payment plans are excellent. They are by far in the lead with this simple concept. I did the 4 month plan and this was at my house in 2 days. This was my first purchase with them and I will do more. Great job guys...                
I was worried that the PMP500 may not drive the sound needed for my 5-6 pcs R&B, Blues band. No worries, the band loved it, the 250 cap house loved it. Great for tight set ups.                 
When it arrived, I took it to the church and unboxed it.  It was very easy to set up!  Very powerful and really clean sound. There were no problems getting it to go.  And I mean GO! Pure, clean power, easy to use and compact!  It even has a handle for easy movement!                  
its been a long time since I've used a mixer and tho it's self explanatory honing in everything is a bit touchy but I really like it                 
I really should have known better. I have dealt with Behringer products over the years and knew they were incredibly unreliable but, I have seen the reviews steadily getting better and better over the years and thought maybe they had improved. Well, I was wrong.
The digital effects sounded terrible and the entire mixer started going out after less than two weeks. No more Behringer for this guy.
zZounds on the other hand, is awesome!                
After eight months the Aux In level control doesn't work. Now, one month after the warranty expired the Main Mix level controls are going fast. Time to get out the duct tape and hope for the best. I'll buy the QSC GX5 and a dedicated mixer, because I know better now.                
This little mixer is great for Karaoke or if your trio needs small mixer. The send to powered speakers is so clean and the power out to speakers works great for monitors. mp3 player works great too.Sound is clean out of this little mixer.                
Love this small mixer, it is light weight with a small form factor but still has plenty power. The class D amp is very cool and high temp is not an issue. It is great for my dj gigs in small venues.                
Sounds great and is easy to use.  The feedback reduction system actually works quite well. I was pleasantly surprised.
It is a nice amp.  Time will tell if it lasts as long as my old 25 year old Peavey.  For 550 watts, it does not sound as loud as I expected, but it seems to stay clear even at higher settings.  Overall a nice piece of equipment.
I've bought and used many Behringer products throughout the years and have never been disappointed. The little guy is a beast! It pushes my JBL 12" floor monitors with plenty of headroom. The effects are excellent although I only use plate reverb. No phantom power but so what. It does have a wireless microphone adapter built in which I could see useful for MC work. It should easily cost double what I paid and it's so light and compact it will fit anywhere including the top of my guitar amp. Excellent choice for rehearsals, and small crowds.                
This was exactly what I needed for smaller gigs where my 18 channel Behringer unit was excessive and I didn't need all of those inputs.                
I am an avid karaoke singer that has always wanted equipment that a professional could use. This unit filled the bill It's powerful, versatile, and has a clean clear crisp sound from highs to lows. For the price, it's the best thing I've found after exhaustive searches and reading many reviews here and elsewhere. You can't go wrong...Pro or amateur.
I have not needed Manufacturer support, but it's required to rate it, so I gave it a 5 star rating just knowing they are a top rated company.                
Received the mixer in just four days. Great shipping.Have used it twice and it performed great. Have only turned it up about half way. It has a plenty of headroom. It does great with my two  15 inch JBL's.  Thanks to ZZOUNDS  and Behringer.  Lynn Huneycutt  Albemarle North Carolina                
Myself and all the guys who I jam with love the new mixer. It is very easy to use and has a great sound.                
For the money, this is unbeatable! I have played professionally for nearly 30 years, owned nearly every piece of sound equipment you could have through the years. If you are tired of hauling racks of heavy and far more expensive gear to do a small gig, or a rehearsal, this mixer is for you ...........and me! Very happy with this unit. No it doesn't sound like a million bucks, but if you know anything about sound, or have a good ear, it will do the job. Then you can keep the other $999,700.oo in your pocket                
I've owned several Behringer mixers, the only reason I've sold them is I keep current with their gear. The first two mixers are still being used around town. This mixer is the best bang for the buck I've ever seen. It's powerful, light, very sophisticated for the price. It actually kicks butt on all the other mixers twice the price. 
Now a word about the reviewer who gave this one star. It really irritates me that people who hate Behringer go around and write fictitious reviews on equipment they don't even own. If you read the reviews you can figure out they're lying. Some people just hate Behringer and for no good reason. Don't listen to their baloney, they are liars and don't add to the reviews in any way.                
Been playing professional since 1989. For a small gig or rehearsal this will do the job. Wish someone made equipment like this when I was young and spent $2k to do the same job as this unit.                
Sound was never great, woefully underpowered, and now 2 separate failures in a little over a year (the 2nd one is not being covered, boo!) and you only get 3 year warranty if you register within 90 days. Don't. Just don't. :(                
The Preamps on this unit are fantastic. They are clean and give alot of headroom. Being the singer, It's important to  me for the words to get across in live situations. For fun, we hooked this up and recorded live, just some musical ideas. Put a mic in front of each guitar cabinet and vocal. The PFL button. (pre fader level) helped me achieve a very clean sound without clipping. The effects are useable, it will take a little bit of time to dial in the effects for your situation.                 
This thing is full of features. If you dont like the built in effects, you can run outboard effects. The Overall EQ is decent. No it is not a 32 band eq. It's 7. It's enough to dial in a better overall sound. The Stereo imaging feature was very nice. Also love that this unit has the behringer speaker processor. In case youre mains can't handle lows very well. Feedback kill function works mice as well.                 
Well, great sound is all in the listener's ears. It didnt' take me much time at all. Read the manual, then hook it up. I ran 2 mains in stereo at 8ohms. This was loud enough to compete with a drummer, 2 guitar players and a bass player. For drums, either get another small board, or run 3 mics. 2 overhead, one of the kick. The sound from this thing was just unreal. Very good.                 
Product seems well built. no blemishes, cosmetics are ok. I plan on using this on the road...but a case is something I need to invest in.                 
For the price range, this is the most xlr inputs I could find. I needed a power amp or a powered mixer. This this fits my needs well. After shopping for several months, I decided on this unit. It allows the opportunity to grow as money and maturity allow. (you can add another power amp, you can add outboard effects or eq. It even has an out for a sub, with a built in limiter.  I would have liked to see the build in compressor in this unit, but it has a lot of features that are useable. Took no time in getting used to the layout.                  
haven't contacted them.                 
It looks decent. Sex appeal...well if red and orange get you off you're gonna love it. Sitting in our rehersal space, yes it is pretty impressive.                
This thing should last a long time. It's class d amp technology, I don't understand how it works, but it does. This machine ran for 10 hours straight and stayed cool to the touch. fans are quiet. the standby button is a very nice feature. (kills sound to all channels) I love this thing. If you can't get a good sound with it, then you don't know what you're doing. 
I would buy it again if stolen. Behringer gets a bad rap, while it is true thier earlier stuff had some quality control issues, this is the second piece of gear I have bought from them, and it works very well.                 
I am impressed! We use about 13 of the channels for vocals,keyboard and pedal steel. So far, the EQ on the individual channels has been all we've needed. I leave the Graphic EQ set flat. Never been able to do that before. There is lots of output. My speakers are old 8ohm cabs and there is still lots of volume. I use one channel for mains and the other for monitors and it works great. We play a very diverse range of music and I'm pleased to say that this board seems to cover it all well.                
There just seems to be all the buttons and knobs that are necessary for all we would need. I was worried when I read some reviews about the on-board effects. So far, I'm finding everything we need. I'm pleased to say that it all works well.                
The layout is staight-forward and the colors used to separate the different sends are easy to see but not obnoxious. I really like the switch for going from mono to left-right channels and the speaker matching feature is cool.                
This is the second piece of Behringer gear I own. It was perfect out of the box. All the knobs and controls feel solid and the same. No changes from one channel to another,etc. I've pushed it pretty hard so far and it still works. I hope it lasts a long time as it does what I expect out of it.                
The 700watt power amp that I replaced with this purchase, cost more used than this whole unit!                
I've never needed any repairs done yet but I did have a question and they got right back to me with an answer.                
As I mentioned before, the colors and the lay-out are great. Not sexy or flashy, just easy and usable.                
Being able to use 2 effects at the same time, sent to mains and/or monitors, separate Graphic EQ's for mains and/or monitors was why I bought this model. I won't be for want of a different unit for the foreseeable future.                 
i purchased this mixer and it worked and sounded great. i was using powered mains, not the internal power amp. when i went to use the internal power amp, for my monitors, only the A side worked? Nothing would come out of the B side. I researched further, and read a whole lot of negative reviews, about this problem & Behringer's Quality control. I took mine to my favorite nearby music store, and they fixed the problem INSTANTLY! In order for ther internal power amp to run 4 monitors @ 4 ohms, you have to "trick" the mixer. Insert a jumper from L power amp insert to A monitor send, then do the same thing on the B side. Now i have all 1600 watts pushing my 4 monitors, using the internal power amp. Quick fix & only cost $10 for the jumper cords. I was ready to ship it back, because i thought the mixer was defective. The way Behringer designed this unit, they want YOU to buy an External power amp! NO NEED TO FOR THAT. PROBLEM SOLVED.  I hope this helps out any further folks stumbling on this problem.                
So far I've worked 4 gigs with the new Behringer board and the sound qulity has skyrocketed. I was using a Phonic Powerpod 1860 but it was constantly clipping and cutting out at higher power levels. I original used it as a soloist but it wasn't handling the band volume. 
This Behringer really fits the bill! I would recommend it to any band working lounges or outdoor gigs.                
I am very happy with this mixer. I had it up, plugged in, and running our worship team in just a few minutes. We've had it over a month and have zero issues with the mixer. At this point I would rate it as excellent. I am hoping for some longevity with this and don't see why I won't get it.                
I work with a lot of different boards and very much like the features on this one. I like the multiple effects and the ability to tune each channel seperately. The power is great since I do as much outside work as inside. Also works well in the studio.                
The effects are great. I really like the feedback indicators built into the equilizer. Great power. I would put it up against any of the higher priced brands.                 
Learning the effects and how to adjust them was a little difficult without a manuel.                
Seems to be well constucted. Had one button cracked when I unpacked it with no visable package damage.                
Very much worth the money. Definitely equal or better than higher priced models.                
Looks good. Differing colors on control knobs allows for quick identification.                
I have had this for a few years it is still going strong!! I will buy again when the time comes.                
I purchased a previously returned powered mixer. The listing on the website promotes buying these items as a great deal and savings. That part is true. I would be very cautious ever doing this because of the terrible packaging.my 25 pound stereo mixer was shipped in the original box, but without any cushioning material. A wad of paper was included in the box. During shipment, the box was dropped and the mixer was damaged. It still works but can't be fixed without paying a fortune. I was offered a return but I can't afford a new unit. Be careful.                
 Everything you need and more for a friendly price! The power section is a tad overdone on the spec sheet but still powerful enough for a small band!                
I bought this head to run non powered cabs. Ended up buying some powered mackies instead and the head runs it great. great head room quite.                
It sounds great when it works. Had this product less that 6 months, in less than a week Channel 1 had some issues. Then it sounded like my speakers were distorting. I rebuilt them totally with high quality selenium drivers. And it sounded awesome. I decided to put some serious horns in my cabinets. And it still sounded great with everything at unity gain. Then all of the sudden melt down.                 
This product has almost everything you could want for a mixer.                
Interface is intuitive but the effect processors could have better readouts                
It appears out of the box well made. But the knobs are cheaper plastic and can come off. I would definitely get a case of some kind to protect it. Additionally the advertising states this is a 1600 watt board. If you run it like most it's 800 watts at best 400 per side. So to me that is less than half of the rated power. What small band is going to run this thing in bridge mode?                 
It's ok but not great!                
Initially it all seemed pretty nice, however took two weeks before the repair shop could even look at my board, then Behringer has the part on backorder, that tells me that these things are dying left and right. I have been without my board for over a month now and my band has lost out on numerous gigs. If you are a local band playing clubs every weekend DO NOT buy this product. Man I wish I had my Mackie gear again.                
I'm looking now.                
My wife and friends had purchased this unit with great expectations from another retailer for me for my birthday. It was sadly disappointing. For such a "powerful" unit it put out about 30 watts of power. I called Behringer 2 times and got "techno speak" from someone that told me that digital output was different from analog. I had compared it to my Fender Passport unit that put our far superior sound. I brought the unit to a sound engineer to look it over and he said that it was sorely deficient and putting out according to specifications. Behringer  did not offer any substantive help and deflected an inquiry. I ended up returning the merchandise back and getting a complete refund. I also spoke with other musicians that had the same issue with their Behringer powered mixers, so I know it was not a fluke. Caveat Emptor!                
The unit was defective and the manufacturer was completely uninterested.                
Great mixer, however I would advise you on buying Extra amps or just buy a regular mixer with no amp built in and buy the Amps separately, I have a Salsa Band, 13-15 Channels working, trust me, this did not cut it, I'm buying a regular Behringer and 2 Amps to power my speakers and subwoofer,                
I've had buyers remorse ever since. I was hoping to save money because of the price difference between this and Peavey. All I've had is trouble and for the second time in less than two years of having it, I'm without sound again. I had forgotten about how impossible it is to get ahold of the warranty department until just now after waiting for over 20 minutes then finally giving up and leaving a callback number. Like the last time, I don't expect a call any time soon.                
I bought this unit new and A little over a year later it stopped working, now the lights just flash on it, nothing else. its hard to get any parts for it , what the heck, manuel is a peace of crap. now I have a $6 hundred peace of junk. I will never again own anything with the behringer name on it, by the way, it comes from germany. no one around here can fix it. dont buy this unit. it sucks.                
It is a great setup for the first time Podcaster or studio recording. You will begin to understand and master the basics of audio, recording, editing etc. Good luck to those who purchase it.                
I have only had it for only a week. I have used it for several live online broadcast with an omnidirectional mic and everyone said the sound was great. I wish the unit had an on and off switch.                
I own this product and I must say for the price you get a good deal. Depending on the speakers you have, the saound quality is decent and actually could even be used for a little kareoke or amatuer live sound. The audio interface that came with the bundle, though, was...well...worth the money. I tweaked with everything I could think of and got nothing but a gargled sound and static from it when used on my computer. The product bundles are very limited also if you're into recording. You may want to get a recording mic also.                
As I said it actually isn't bad for the price. For general amatuer podcasts and recording, the accessories are easy to figure out and accessible. The mixer delivers a clean sound. The mic isn't the greatest, though, and the interface is aweful.                
It's actually very easy to use and set up....unless you run into a problem. The guides that came with the product weren't in english so I couldn't understand anything in them.                
Quality is not bad. I praise the work on the mixer once again for its durablity because it's been through hell. As for the mic and the interface, it'd be best to make sure those stay protected at all times.                
You get what you pay for. It's worth $99 as a bundle.                 
I have not dealt with the company.                
This product isn't a technical marvel...let's be honest. This type of thing has been arround for years. It's pretty basic.                
I've had this for a few months now and once again I love the mini mixer that came with it. It works for my recording needs since I only use a few channels at a time anyway and it sounds great. As for the interface I've upgraded to an E-MU 0404 Audio/MIDI Interface which gives me a hell of a lot more accesibility. I use recording mics for drums but I still use the mic that came with it for vocal recording just because it saves money. I bought an M-Audio pre amp to help it along but it gets the job done. Overall it's not bad for what you spend for it. I definately recomend this for amatuers.                
Have only had this system for a little over a month and I already love it. I host Karaoke shows and have for the past eighteen years. In the past, using my laptop, I would have to stream my background music on a separate program than my karaoke. This put a big strain on my CPU and made for frequent crashing and glitches. Now I can stream my music from an iPod connected via Bluetooth to the system and run my karaoke on a different channel on the mixer, so it lightened the load on my CPU and my shows are clean and smooth. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a system that is easily broken down for travel. Great for weddings and public speaking too! The Behringer PPA2000BT is the perfect solution for DJ's on the move. Highly recommended! Crisp highs and a booming low end, this thing has it all. Not to mention a ton of built in effects and the ability to connect the Behringer wireless mics via the USB jack on the board.                 
Behringer 2000 is a fine system for venues up to 200 or more people. The Bluetooth capabilities you can't do without once you've used them. The Teknik effects are a must have that you don't get with other systems. Beware though, you don't get the speakers with the YELLOW Behringer symbol on the front unless you upgrade. The microphone, you let others use for karaoke. I upgraded to a Sennheiser 935, which sounds great with this system, even with the provided cables. I'll be upgrading to the S. 965 soon. The 20 foot cables are good but they will be upgraded also. A longer cable is what I'm looking for. Overall the system is great. I'm going to add a subwoofer and may upgrade to the Yellow tagged speakers. I'll be buying a second one.                
So this is a great product. It's made larger than it needs to be, I think partially in order to provide some protection to the contents. In my case, that's not necessarily a good thing, as I travel across country and bought this PA system for that purpose. 
I suppose if I was to do it again, I may look at a different system, but since I have it, I'm very happy with it so far. It has alot of features I'd not traditionally use (like the effects processor), and some that have come in more handy than I expected (like the wireless mike port and the bluetooth connectivity). 
Overall, I think Behringer really considered portability and performance in this package. Had they just focused a little more on compactness (even a few inches), it would fit nicely into traditionaly Pelican boxes. 
In order to ship this product through the airlines, I looked to have a custom box made. I was pretty impressed that I could have one made for around $250. 
Fortunately, I was able to find a cheaper (and probably more temporary) option at walmart. the i-fly fiber hard-shell expandable suitcase fits this unit like a glove. You have to expand the case and unnzip the partition, but it fits with inches to spare, allowing you to check this unit in without any extra expense (it comes in just under 55 lbs, too). I looked at hundreds of cases, totes, etc. before finding this little $70 gem. 
At any rate, I'm using a sennheiser ew-100 mic pack and the sound is crystal clear; I'm also using the optional Behringer wireless microphone and the bluetooth connectivity to my computer for music. It's performed flawlessly so far.                 
Works great. Using with my Shure Beta91A mic and it does the job                
I believe I purchased 2, while only meaning to purchase 1 and neither fit and was unfortunately in an accident and failed to return them, but they do not fit. you would think I was looking for the holy grail... I also want to say that your previous service has been outstanding, and I believe your co. has integrity. Otherwise I wouldn't bother with this.                
Performs flawlessly with no noise and no signal degradation. Built like a tank and feels solid and weighty. Great price for what you get (check out other patch bays and you'll see). I added another rack to my project studio and needed another bay (this is my second px3000) to handle the new routings. The switches beat the heck out of having to take apart and change card positions to do straight thru or half and full normalling, and they too (the switches) feel solid and dependable. Don't waste your money on patch bays by higher profile "name" brands; get one or two of these instead.                
I have five of these in studio rack and they make life so much more simple with the ability to push a slider to select Normalled, Half-Normalled, or Through. They are not expensive but they do exactly what they are supposed to do, look good doing it, and you don't have to bother with flipping circuit boards and plgugs around to change it's function. The only thing I can think of that would improve them is a more detailed and easily understood set of instructions on what the purpose of Normal, Half-Normal, and Through are for and how better plan setting up a patch system that will work first time.                
Well a good patchbay should not introduce any sound. This one does not as far as I can tell and I use excellent headphones for reference.                 
The 3-Mode Multifunctional design is great although having the switches on the front instead of the top you think would be an obvious improvement. But having them on top does help protect your settings once mounted on your rack. I design my rack setup with an open space above and a cover for that slot - if I need to get to the switches it is pretty easy.                
If you understand what the switches are for, it is very simple to use.                
This piece of equipment seems to be built like a tank; heavy and the switches and jacks seem to be of high quality. The jacks work the way they should and are very smooth. Although I am using this in a studio, I would not hesitate to take it on the road.                
Great piece of gear for the money; I will add another when the time comes to upgrade my studio.                
Have not needed any                
It looks great and well built the design aesthetics go great in the studio and looks very professional.                
I would replace this with the same if it were to wear out. I would also buy another if I needed to expand.                
Just avarage. Cheap price, cheap product                
Behringer support is legendary to take forever and cost more than the product. For a price tag below $50, I'd consider it's a consummable.                
All the money you don't pay upfront (for a dbx, neutrik, hosa, tascam,...) you'll spend in hours crawling behind your desk/flight case stacks to check the connections, removing the unit from teh rack to check the switches (which are a good idea, but stupidly located and inaccessible as soon as the unit is racked)

the Behringer Q1002 is a great mixer the quality of its sounds reproduction far exceeds is moderate cost, you cannot go wrong with this unit.                
Great mixer. I record my radio program that has a mix of somgs and talk. Great sound. Easy to use.                
I just received my Behringer mixer and my Behringer wireless mic ..  and i immediately used it two day to dj a small wedding . Ok the mixer is good its solid and its compact so that's all very nice. The Behringer wireless mic has a good sound to it and if i have to say anything bad about its that the double A batteries drain somewhat quick but fortunatly i had a spare 4 pak so always carry batteries if your going to buy the wireless Behringer mic.   But so far its been a good purchase for me.                
I've always been a fan of Behringer products. Don't be fooled by the price tag - this mixer has a lot of bells and whistles, plus quality sound.  I use this one for my weekly podcasts and it works great.                
THE BEHRINGER XENYX USB MIXER IS GREAT I LIKE IT. IT'S VERY EASY TO OPERATE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT I HAVE AND OLD FASHION SOUND SYSTEM. BUT WHEN I DISCOVER ZZOUNDS OVER THE INTERNET, I TOLD TO MY SELF THAT THIS GUYS HAVE A GREAT DEALS ON SOUND SYSTEM, I HAVE TO TRY ORDER SOUNDS FROM THEM, SO I DID AND EVERY ORDER THAT I MADE CAME OUT RIGHT. I WILL ORDER FROM ZZOUNDS AGAIN AND AGAIN. HEY GUYS IF YOU NEED GOOD SOUND SYSTEM GO TO ZZOUND .COM GUARANTEED YOU GET WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR.THANKS FROM: "J AND J ALL IN ONE SOUND SYSTEM"                
I ordered this item as a repacked item...the only problem is when I got it...it was new...everything was there and it works great...
Fast delivery and always good service.                
I bought this for the good sound quality it has for vocals it really accents vocals much better than 2 other similar brands I tried with less feedback .Im using the digitech voice live 3 and you can get great sound with the two together even in a small space such as I have and have no feed back up close with vocal pedal and guitar fairly close ....for me sound is always first and for the money it cant be beaten.I did try the usb recording and had some ground issues but I cant say it was the device cause I have old wiring ...as far as shipping goes they are excellent the tracking is awesome and guitar center is a headache in that respect I have not had a good delivery with guitar center ...guitar center uses whoever is convenient...zzounds has proven stress free delivery.i know this isn't the best quality out there so I'VE give it a 4 star overall I would recommend to a friend . also I always keep plastic cover wrapping over it because dust kills these type of open faders and it doesn't overheat with be wrapped ...keep the dust out and you wont be disappointed...im only giving manufacture support a 2.5 cause I never used it so 50/50 seem fair                
I purchased this board due to how it talked up PC use. Once i received it. I found that nothing has been updated for PC use in a long time. OBS the most used Broadcaster and can't use this board without 3ed party plugins and Voicemeeter. But then it locks VoiceMeeter to only using the mixer and kicks out all other Voicemeeter settings.                
This little mixer is great. The features are very limited, but what is there is of a good quality. That is how it should be when you buy something on the value side - trade cost for features, not quality.
I like the compression on the XLR channel, and the USB connectivity is gold.  Recordings come through nice and clear.
Achieving zero latency was easy with a little hack. Google it and you'll see it can be done. The free Audacity software works great too.
Now that I purchased a larger mixer for some additional XLRs, this little guy will be a submixer. 
You can't go wrong with the 502usb in my opinion.                
This little mixer packs more punch than expected. I'm very happy with my purchase.                
I Bought This Mixer And It Works Good For What You Can Do With It Nice Compression Knob To Go With It Only Thing About It Is It Only Has 12 Vz Of Phantom Power So If Your Tryin To Use A Studio Condenser Microphone You Should Get A Seperate Power Supply                 
This was a perfect mixer to get my home studio organized. I have (believe it or not) three computers hooked up to this mixer. I needed a way to organize connecting all my home studio device with the ease of using an analog mixer. I use MOTU's Ultralite for my sound card driving Logic on my Mac. MOTU by itself is a mixer, but you have to go through the computer to control just about everything. That was horribly inefficient to do simple things (like tone and volume out of my monitor speaker). I have limited real estate on my desktop, so I couldn't get a big mixer in there. This notepad sized mixer was a perfect solution. Now everything is very easy to control. It sounds simple, but I have about 40 wires going back and forth between various devices. Just for organizing the wires, this mixer was heaven sent. I use all its inputs in the following way:Mic 1 -> Condenser MicMic 2 -> Mic 2 or Zoom G2.1U guitar pedal inputch3 & 4 -> MOTU Ultralite outputCh 5 & 6 -> Computer 2 audioUSB -> Computer 3 input/outputTape In -> extra CD player input (when you don't want to use computer CD drive)Output 1 -> Monitor speaker and subwooferOutput 2 -> Goes back to MOTU's inputPhone Out -> Goes to drive loudspeaker measurement hardwareFX Loop -> Goes to Lexicon Multi FXNow tell me if you can organize all this in a limited note pad sized space with anything else other than this. And you can imagine what a nightmare it would be to easily have everything connected in an organized way without it.The extra bonus is that the new mic preamp on this mixer really seems to sound good. Behringer has been saying, for a long time that their preamp is extra special super quality, and we used to laugh about it. But when I connected my condenser mic to this, I was shocked at how full, and bold it sounded. It's definitely few notches above my old Behringer mixer that I bought 10 years ago, and also Mackie that I have. I used to have Protools LE, and even compared to those, this mic preamp is good. I'm not sure if this was due to good matching with my microphone, but it's recommended that you try it out.The other channels are clear, but nothing to write home about. It quietly does its job, and is about what you expect from a hardware of this price range..When I got my mixer, I heard something was sliding inside the casing. I took the screws off, and removed the side panel to find out that an insulation glued on to either the chassis or the PCB that came loose and was sliding around. I removed it, and the mixer is working fine (probably until something hits its underside).I haven't played around with USB too much so far, so I can't comment on it except that it's working fine on the playback. When I get more usage, I'll write another review.I'm eternally grateful to Behringer for coming up with variety of mixer formats. Just look around, and you see what I mean. There isn't anything like this on the market, especially at this price. It was the nail in the coffin for my project studio, and I'm sure there are thousands more usage for it.Unbelievably good mixer for the price with surprisingly good mic preamp, and is recommended for anyone who's space or budget is limited.                
Great little mixer I can take anywhere. Good controls and works great with my Condenser Mic. Great price. Even better, zZounds' shipped so fast I forgot I order it. Great work folks, thanks!!!!!!                
I bought this mixer because it seemed like the cheapest way to get a USB audio adapter for my computer that had gain control on input and output, phantom power for a condensor mic, and a level meter. This mixer, minimally, provides all this but was ultimately not satisfactory. I ended up using a Behringer UCA222 in conjunction with my old Behringer MX802A mixer.Here are some general comments:o The overall frequency response, headroom and signal to noise levels are to a first approximation no better or worse than my several-years-old Behringer MX802A mixer -- The fancy new "Xenyx preamp" branding notwithstanding.o Via USB you at any time can either send audio TO or receive audio FROM the computer, but not both at the same time.o There are only four meter LEDs per channel which is barely enough to be useful if properly calibrated -- but they're not. When outputting the main mix to the computer via USB, the USB data starts clipping when the level is only part way through the third, yellow, LED's range. This is bad. It shouldn't clip unless the fourth, red LED is lit.o When you turn on the receiving of audio from the computer via USB there's a distinctly higher level of background noise present at the main output.o There is no power switch. You turn it on/off by plugging/unplugging the power cord into the back of the unit, and the pins on the connectors are hard to line up.                
I really enjoy the ease of use of this mixer. It is its own sound card, so you don't have to worry about that. The same circuitry as in their larger boards, so the quality is fantastic. I have it paired with a Sennheiser 421 mic and it does a great job. It also works well with Adobe Audition 3.0. Great product!                
Granted this was a cheap device but I had purchased Behringer products in the past and considered them to be of high value/low cost . I wrongly assumed this device was more than it was. Some key specs were left out of the product literature and while the hardware still seemed decent for the price, the drivers were hardly usable.
To enumerate the problems I have had:
* The device is 16-bit, though this was not specified on Behringer's site or any of the online retailers pages. 
* The device is USB 1.1, though this is also not specified.
* The default Windows USB Audio Codec drivers produced cracking at any acceptable latency when combined with ASIO4all v2 driver.
* The official Behringer WDM driver when combined with ASIO4all v2 decently low latency, but occasionally the audio would become momentarily distorted (once every 20 minutes or so).
* The official Behringer ASIO driver works perfectly at 5ms output latency, but Windows (non-ASIO) audio crackle and pop if the device is left at this setting after exiting my DAW.
* When operated with ASIO4all, the device is only available to windows meaning you can run only one ASIO application and sound through windows is unavailable. Granted this is a limitation of the Windows driver model and how ASIO4all operates with it, but I figure this is worth mentioning since Behringer links to this driver from its drivers download page.
* The official ASIO drivers do not allow many parameters to be tweaked. Cannot choose number of buffers and buffer sizes are only select-able in a predefined list. ASIO bit depth is hardcoded to 32 bit.
* There is no manual available, only a quickstart guide although the quickstart guide refers you to the manual for more information. 
* When I voiced some of these complaints to Behringer I was told that they couldn't help me, but they would let the guys in China know.
I did go through the normal troubleshooting process of choosing high performance power settings in windows, removing old drivers, turning off cpu power management, stopping unnecessary services etc., trying different usb ports and removing all but essential usb devices.  All of the above issues were experienced in Windows 7 64-bit on a moderately spec'd machine: Quad core phenom II @ 3Ghz w/4GB DDR2 ram.                
sounds very live and loud from the USB at 16/48, its max. Good headphone output, potentially ear melting.                
I have only had this board for few weeks, but so far it has been incredible! The FX are crisp and clean. The board functions easy to get use to and the USB option is excellent! I would recommend this board to anyone starting out and even to those that are experienced. Will be trying the recording feature soon at a live show, once i download the software!                
Im very happy with this mixing board, the sound effects are amazing and very easy to adjust and apply.i know some people put down behringer products, but i have quite a few and have only good things to say about this company, never had 1 problem with anything. as far as this board is concerned..it has made recording and playing so much easier and fun.the usb plugs right into the computer and play...that simple.the EQ sounds stellar and really makes a huge difference in the sound quality of my music. for the price, you cannot beat it...i totally recommend this mixing board to anyone who wants to increase the quality of there sound.                
Sound quality is great. It's used for various setups including acoustic open mic formats and small band performances. Very low noise in live applications.  Haven't used this at all for recording.                
Big advantage with this line of mixers is the compression. Second advantage is the configurable parameters of the effects.  Dual aux sends with fader is a plus as with the all mute button.                
Same type of eq as Berhringer's (and most others) powered mixers.  If you have a good handle on that , then dial in the compression so you can elevate the vocals on the fader to get level above the instruments.                
Been buying Behringer products since they were available here in the states. Have several processors, powered mixers, amps and DI's. Never had one single problem with a failure of any of them. My opinion: road worthy, great value for the money, reliable, predictable performance.                
It's a bargain.                 
Never had to contact them.                
I like lighted indicators, the more the better.  It helps in dark rooms.                 
If you use a powered mixer now, this is a nice transistional unit to the newer way of live sound.  Of course you'll need a power amplifier or powered speakers, but you'll gain much greater control over sound dynamics.                
My wife and I d.j. a lot of shows. The size and weight of the gear was getting way out of hand. We have switched to Beringer equipment. Twice the power, 1/4 the weight and our music sounds better then ever. The best part was the price. Check there gear out . You won't be sorry.                
I am an experienced karaoke host and have been doing shows for more than 10 years. I pride myself in providing the best user experience so I try to make sure they sound as good as they possibly can. I have been using my  Xenix X1222USB for 4 years and decided I needed a new mixer to ensure I had backup for my shows and a 2nd mixer for weddings etc. I'm now using th eX1222USB as my backup and just started using the QX model. 
I love the fact this mixer has USB sound. It gives a clear output and also allows me to record the singers at the click of a button using my CompuHost software. The compressors are great for the too soft and too loud voices at every show. The British EQ is great to tone the mics properly and all of the controls are smooth and well placed. The effects are better than the old ones on the x1222 and are a lot easier to use and adjust. It has a USB port for a USB fob type microphone receiver for the ULM-200 mics and I will be ordering them when they are available.                
This mixer performs well in the most important mixing task of being dead quiet. If you experience any unwanted noise, it would be coming from your cables, instruments  or some outside source of electrical interference.                
The built in compression and digital multi effects are a real bonus, especially at this price. They all sound great.  The EQ is excellent.  I do have some nitpicks on the features. The four mono inputs allow you to connect via XLR or 1/4" plug, but not both. It would be nice if they added an input select switch for those channels so you could use both inputs without changing connections. Although the built in effects sound great and all of the important effects you're likely to use are covered, I wish there was more flexibility in the adjustment parameters on some of them. It would be nice to have the ability to select at least a couple of effects and set them up in series or parallel. The multi-effects they provide are useful, but you are limited to a few preset choices. You can't save user presets, but any adjustments you make will remain if you go to another effect and come back. They don't automatically return to a default setting which is nice. I also wish there was a way of adjusting the viewing angle contrast on the display. It's hard to see what effect is active unless you are almost directly over the mixer. All that being said, the effects are very high quality and are a real bonus. You can always connect an outboard processor via the inserts for more flexibility, especially if you want different effects on different channels. There are separate mix controls on each channel for internal and insert effects.                 
I've been using a similar type of mixer for more than 30 years, so if I said really easy, it might not seem quite so easy to someone with little or no prior mixing experience. I still have to say as far as mixers of this type go, it is really easy to use.                 
This mixer appears to be very well made. The sockets are tight and the controls feel very sturdy. In a studio, there's nothing about it that would lead me to believe there would be any durability issues. If used on the road, a solid, fitted, foam-lined carrying case would be essential.                
This mixer provides a huge bang for the buck. The built in high quality effects are what really set this apart in this price range.                
Some of functions on this mixer are configured a little differently than my old mixer. I thought I had a couple of inputs which weren't working. I looked in the manual and tried all kinds of things with no luck. I e-mailed the company and got a response in fairly short order that immediately solved the issue. The person who responded was very friendly. This does lead me to one complaint. The manual covers four models of Xenyx mixers. Although they have a lot in common, there are distinct differences and it can be very confusing looking at information and illustrations which don't apply to my model. There should be a specific manual for each model. This may have prevented me from having to e-mail on a small issue I should have been able to easily find in the manual. A troubleshooting guide would also be helpful.                
Very appealing. Mixers like this are a basic utility for bands and anyone working with multiple sound sources. The wow on this would be the excellent built in effects.                
I bought this to replace a 30 year old mixer with a similar number of inputs and outputs. I made a good choice.                
I was using a Mackie 1604VLZPro from 2001 and it's footprint was way too huge for the space I had available in my new studio. So I went smaller plus I wanted an USB audio interface with the mixer. The QX1622USB was smaller than I needed but the price was right so I bought it. The first time I set it up and plugged in everything I could hardly wait to turn it on. That anticipation ended very quickly when I turned it on. There was a terrible hissing noise that I never got rid of. My Mackie didn't have it so I knew it was the Behringer. I tried everything to get rid of the hiss and even bought a tiny box designed to stop electrical static/ground noise bleeding into the cables from my PC. It's called a ground loop isolator. It worked pretty good so I thought it was my PC laptop that was making the noise because when I unplugged in the little box the hiss was less evident though not totally eliminated. Well, all of my recordings still had a terrible sibilant hiss during the quiet moments. But I lived with it for a year. During that time I noticed the faders (sliders) making crackling noises when I moved them. I always used a dust cover so I don't think it was dirt and debris making the noise. Then the left main fader began to crackle and eventually it failed almost completely. I could play with the fader and get some sound from it. After several months the entire unit was making all kinds of strange growling noises while playing my keyboards. After researching the problem it's a common complaint with Behringer mixers. I visited the Behringer website to see about the 3 years warranty but -- get this -- it's a 1 year warranty unless you register the product within 90 days, which I didn't and it's over a year old. So now it's a disposable mixer since it'll cost more to ship both ways and to get fixed. Happily I decided to buy a Mackie ProFX16v2 and I'm absolutely amazed at the pristine quality and 99% lack of sibilance even while wearing headphones! It's a joy! The Behringer NEVER sounded this good. And my Behringer B2031A Truth Active Monitors never sound as good either! I was rather disappointed with them and their sound until I bought the Mackie ProFX16 mixer! Please, if you're considering the QX line of mixers, I suggest otherwise. KEEP LOOKING. Buy anything else. Quality matters!                
This mixer is a great mixer for the money. It has a lot of great features like the compressors and equaliser. The lighting on the display could have been better its a little hard to read. But other than that I would recommend this to everyone.                
Behringer QX1832USB XENYX USB works great!!! I have been using it of over a month and love it.                 
For the most part this is a very nice little mixer with VERY low noise.  I'm using it as an external aux  EFX return Direct Out mixer to my main large format recording console.
The only problem I had with my new one was that when it was first turned on it made some funny loud noises, 2 mix LED ladder didn't work but after I turned it on a few times with the phantom power turned on it then worked fine and still does with no problems.  The delays sounds great but I thought maybe the Klark Teknik reverbs could've sounded a little better but they're usable in a mix.  
NOTE: What I wish mixing board manufactures would start doing is instead of having a mute button with it's associated LED just have a channel ON/OFF button with the LED indicator ON if you want that channel to work.  Then the board would have the LEDs  'ON' if you need that channel to work. Makes total sense and sense LED bulbs last virtually forever LED isn't really an issue. (plus the WOW factor would be a heck of a lot better! :)        
This mixer arrived quickly and works perfectly. It has a lot of features for the money. The effects are surprisingly good and the USB interface is great. I do wish there was a way to route the USB signal through a channel for EQ or effects. Anyway the mixer has been running 24/7 in a small theater for nightly shows without a hitch. Great value - thank you Behringer.                
I replaced a failed Mackie board with this one for our small church. I had only one day to install and set up this mixer before a special program for Christmas but it worked flawlessly. I am impressed!                
the sound is clean and give plenty of headroom and the effects are very good                 
the routing options and the eq/compression are useful but the wireless mic option is kind of a waste for me anyway                   
this is a pretty straight forward mixer you can have it up and running in no time                 
faders and knobs seem tight and well put together but we will see how it works in a year                 
very happy it has done much more than I expected well worth the cash                
no problems with any of behringers equipment I have as of yet                  
as far as mixers go it looks good ..and it has flashing lights  ooooooh                
originally bought this mixer as a add on to give more inputs for drums ,vocals etc. on our Tascam 24 track but with the clean sound and above level effects it has become the main mixer for recording . The 8 direct outs and sub outs give you all the routing you need. 90% of the mastering is done  using this board also. I set the track levels on the Tascam and route them back to the qx2442 for final effects and levels then use its built in usb to send a finished master to the pc for tweaking
Easy to set up is a to use                
Fun to play with easy to use                
I have three friends that use this model they love it                
It is a very good value I did not want a powered mixer                
Not yet                
This is a great product                
This is a very good measure                
Great mixer, I bought this one as an up grade from the x2222fx because of the usb and ability to record. It work awesome with my new Yamaha club series speakers and subs                
Very good                
It has a wireless mic option that might be okay if you can stay with in the 100 to 200 ft range? Other than that it's a bear bones mixer.                 
Very straight forward to use, anyone with any experience will have no issues using this mixer                
Very high quality good pots great sliders fit and finish very good. Has lots of ins and outs 4 chanel sub mixing, works well with other components just not with its self. Compressors little to no good, pre's okay. FX good, but I have outboard stuff.                 
The X2442 is cheaper and has all the connectivity, 3d sound, more for less, in my opinion.                 
They tried, my problem was that the product just wasn't capable of doing what I wanted. They informed of what it could do, and tried to blame my other equipment for its inadequaticys.                
Thought there was but I was wrong!                 
Good little mixer, works well but didn't realize it was so bear bones, all it does is mix ? The cheaper X2442 does way more and costs less, unless a 2 chanel wireless mic system that cost more than buying one is a peeling to you? It's lack of range makes it not a option for me.                 
Pretty decent. It's cheap behringer gear. What do you want, QSC for $200?                
Loads of touting capsbility. Excellent.                
Once you figure out the front panel, it's fine.                
Well, I would just be careful with it. Behringer pots have a way of just breaking off in a stiff breeze...from experience...                
Great value. Until it breaks from bringnlooked at too hard...lol...mine hasn't, but just saying...                
Never neededzzz                
Wow!!! It's still not broken after 5 gigs and a few rehearsals!!!!
The $300 rack case prob helps...lol                
Bought this to use as a keyboard/etc mixer for live gigs...had 3 synths, a headset mic, and a monitor return going into it, and separate vox and keys out to main mixer.  Behringer users know they pack every feature they can think of including the kitchen sink into all of their products, including loads of useless nonsense, but the routing capabilities are always appreciated. I have an out to one of my monitor speakers inputs, with my keys and vox, and another out carrying the main monitor mix to the other input on my speaker (EV ZLX 12)
Pretty handy. 
In fact, I even used it a few times as a main mixer for a 7 piece band rehearsal including V Drums and it worked out just great.
Only real complaints, first, as with all behringer sound reinforcement gear, it clips at ridiculously low input gain settings....it's why I avoid their loudspeakers, and two, the front panel is confusing and cramped. But you get used to it. For the price, it's great. Def recommend just for the routing.
FX are sufficient for basic stuff....Don't expect Lexicon and you won't be disappointed, lol.                
This mixer was purchased as an all purpose mixer for small venues. And a Drum Mixer for large venues. As part of my rack system, it goes where the show is. I have used this in 4 shows so far, it works like a charm. MY ONLY COMPLAINT, the power button on this rack mounted system is in the back.                
The mic preamps have fairly decent headroom and clearity for a drumset. Besides the hall reverbs, the rest of the effect are pretty good and clean sounding. I guess they chose to use the DSP for more bit rate rather than sample rate. So it's 24bit, but only 40 instead of 44.1.                 
I like that it has inserts on every channel to interface with my 8 channel sound card plus additional aux sends and return. No return level on those, but most external effects processors already have that. I wish there was a pre and post switch for those as they are pre only. Also, a larger VU meter. Other than that, it's perfect.                
It's very easy to use. They kept it simple. The trim is able to tame down hot mics with no attenuator button. There's no mid EQ but just the hi and low sound great and do the job..                 
I got a blemished sent back one, so some of the pots were tighter than others and the FX knob sticks sometimes. Can't complain for what I paid at all. Was easily fixed.                
Extremly awesome value. It's not a real professional mixer, but very close in many ways. Great job Behringer.                 
Never used it.                
There aren't many mixers like it or have the quality in sound. Also, the blue LEDs are always a wow.                 
I got this to work with an M-Audio Delta 1010LT and it worked out vey well. Use it for both recording and live.                
Great little mixer just wished it had a little more Eq options but, it works well for mic-in my drums.                
The only thing it doesn't have that I like to use is the Mids.  But it still produces a great sound for my shows.  I like the where the XLR connectors are located in the rear rather than where the EQ's are at.  It gives it a nice clean look and you never have to worry about having cables in the way.                
It's very light and gives out great sounds.                
The value on this is great                
I like the small space in the rack and the mixer sounds fairly good. But it falls short, if you want to use this mixer stand alone. The 2 band channel EQ doesn't give enough control over the tone. To get the sound you want, you will have to add a separate EQ to your rack. Also, the effects are terrible, so you'll likely add some external rack for vocal effects. And the most annoying short fall is the lack of channel mutes. I wouldn't buy this unit again!                
I use this line mixer as a sub-mixer to my main ROLAND M12E mixer. The sound of the BEHRINGER is totally transparent (the way it should be!), and I can't tell the difference between the sound modules/keyboards going straight into my ROLAND from those being sub-mixed first.                   
The handiest feature is the mute/defeat button on every channel. When I get confused about which module is in which channel, I can isolate them without adjusting the levels!
As a line mixer, it doesn't require EQ, so I don't miss that feature. On the two channel inputs for my ROLAND,I can alwasy fine tune the overall EQ for the BEHRINGER if required.                
I now own four different BEHRINGER products, and they all meet/exceed my expectations. A friend offered to sell me a ROLAND M120 line mixer (the same series as my M12E), but I did not like the gain/signal interface between the two, and they're both ROLAND! The stereo outputs of the BEHRINGER are very smooth and linear, and totally match the LED lights.                 
Brand new, this cost $40 less than a used ROLAND M12E currently advertised in a local music store! By the way, I have been totally happy with my ROLAND, although when purchased new about 8 years ago, it was $870 CDN funds.                
I haven't had to contact the company for any of my purchases, so I can't rate the support....what's wrong with that?                 
It looks great, is only 1 unit rack high, so it leaves me room for my other rackmount gear.                
If lost/stolen (Heaven forbid!), I'd replace it immediately with the same item.                
Generally great ... transparent and quite.                
Excellent mix of features for this type of unit. One thing to be aware of, though, is that the documentation says that the aux send is post fader from the factory. The manual documents a mod to make the sends pre-fader. WELL, turns out that from the factory, the unit is already pre-fader (and Behringer confirmed the error in their documentation). This is better anyway, but i didn't find out until after i'd chopped up my unit to make the mod ... doh!                
Generally good. Inside is very clean and durable.                
Couldn't expect much more for the price. The only thing i'd love to have is a tape out to plug into a recorder, but a y-cable on the main outs should work OK.                
Behringer was quick and helpful when i contacted them about the pre/post-fader issue.                
Sounds clean, however on my unit, if you turn the volume up past the half-point mark, it will make your synths sound harsh. Other than that it sounds great!                
Simple, basic, cheap and does it job well.                
plug the wires and the rest should be self explanatory                
Well made on the outside. But on top of the high's being too harsh, my unit right side reads higher than my left side. 
Other than those two things, this machine is great at what I purchased it for.                
You get what you paid for. Silly me for trying to run very expensive synths thru this unit. If your a bedroom producer, this machine is for you.                
Never used them.                
Has sex appeal, which is why I brought it.                
Overall, this machine is excellent at what it does. Like I said above, the unit sounds harsh once you get into the highs and mids and on my unit the right levels reads higher than the left.
If your looking for a good quality rack mixer to go with your quality synths, look to purchase an ASHLY LX-308B, a RANE SM82S, or a Speck X-Sum.                 
I bought this product for my drummer to use it as a mixer for his headphones, cause we are playing with some loops and a metronome. The mixer also has a separate mix for monitor (remember all inputs & outputs are 1/4", but are balanced so you can use an adapter to XLR if you want), which I am using with my wireless in-ear. It does the job and much more, plenty of headroom with the -40db +20 db switch in the back (if i remember correctly) and off course the price was great. I know some people dont think that Behringer is a good brand but I also own a powered speaker which works great and some other products as well. I've used and I also own other brand like Alesis, Yamaha and more, the quality of Behringer gets better and better, I am a 100% satisfied and with that price, nothing else comes close. Great product (s)
So far, I never had to use the Behringer support, so I cant tell, but i'll give them 5 stars, "innocent until proven guilty" :)
Found this product on eBay, but zZounds beat that price! Thanks again guys, you rock!                
I've had this for 3 years now. As a mixer, it does what the ad copy says it does. In real life, the mute buttons become intermittent and the pots get dirty. This leads to a loss of audio until you rotate the pots several times and push the mute buttons in & out repeatedly. Can be frustrating.                
I needed to expand the input capacity of my audio interface without spending thousands on an interface to support all my hardware hookups. This mixer gave me exactly what I was looking for in a very small footprint. I love having the mute buttons on the front and quick control of the pan/volume for each tracks along with the nice output level meter for the whole mixer really makes it great. If you need a good way to bring together a lot of inputs into one location, this is definitely something to look into. If I outgrow it in the future I will just add on another one! Doesn't color the sound or add any noise at all, which is perfect.                
This is a great rackmount mixer. I added this as a sub group mixer running my keyboards and other instruments. Then tied that into my main board and it is wonderful. Great sound smooth, no hum, or feedback at all. I will recommend to everybody.                
I used it on stage for quiet some time to mix down 4 synthesizers to 1 stereo channel. 
Recently I used it during recording session and was shocked what it did with my sounds. Some sounds where just mutulated (especially grand piano's, strings where ok-ish). And it had nothing to do with input volume. 
Looking for something more transparent now.                
Its easy compact and offers exactly what you need, no unneeded extra's. cant say anything else.
One drawback is that it has no smooth control knobs, they move in steps.                
very easy to use. Mostly due to its lack of complexity and options. But hey thats what you want for a line mixer in live situations right.                
so far pretty reliable except for the sound problems (see sound part of the review)                
Its cheap, but don't expect a clear, transparent and professional sound. Live it might be ok, but in a studio its a big no no.                
No idea. never needed to contact Behringer                
Kind of regret buying it now. Its not as good as Behringer wants you to believe. I am selling my Behringer linemixer now and buying a better quality one.                 
This mixer gives you a very nice, clean, and transparent sound.                
The mixer doesn't have eq and the effects are set to pre-fader unless you want to solder individual channels to post-fader.                
It has a solid build quality.                
This mixer is a great value if you just want something as a signal router.  EQ and a post-fader aux send would have made this mixer perfect.  I use this mixer as a submixer for a sound module, sampler, tape deck, and turntable.  I usually only record one track at a time so the fact that it's a stereo mixer doesn't matter.  If you have similar needs, this mixer is a great value.                
I haven't needed to contact them.                
This thing is not the best looking item in my rack but it is very functional.  If you take a look at other rackmountable line mixers, they're all like that.  I think mixers, on the whole (rack mount, console, desktop, etc.), are ugly looking components.                  
I really like this mixer.  I'd buy it again if it got run over by a truck.  You can get bogged down with all the bells and whistles of other mixers, but if you're like me and you record one track at a time, just need a good signal router or submixer, and you do your mixing on a computer with plug-ins, this mixer is the best you will find.                
The bass response was noticeably lacking between the audio going into and that coming out of the mixer.  The high end was brittle and higher insturments in the mix such as high hat were emphasized that hadn't been going in.  Overall, the sound was extremely flat and narrow, suggesting the possibility of crosstalk between the stereo channels.                
Having all stereo inputs is nice, but unfortunately someone decided to give this mixer stepped knobs, so you have a very limited number of possible volume settings with large gaps between each.  Also, the aux sends are permanently set to pre-fader and require soldering to change.                
Everything looks fine.                
I suppose that you get what you pay for with this cheap a mixer.                
I bought the S16 to help expedite Load in/out of venues and to reduce the amount of cabling my guys have to deal with.   Setup took only a few minutes and I was up and running.  I built a Cat-6 shielded cable with  Ethercon connectors and results have been perfect. It's nice to park the rack at the stage. Mics in, outputs feed the amp rack for mains and floor mons. The addition of the S16 to the X32 has trimmed about an hour off of setup and teardown. Behringer has certainly upped their game with the X32 and accessories.   I certainly don't miss hauling the big analog snake around!                
Hey there. I am writing this more as an informational piece than a review because I had some problems integrating the SD16 into my existing X32 with two S16 setup and I could not find any information at all online to help me. I called zZounds and they referred me to Behringer's tech support. Basically here is what happened. 
I bought the SD16 as a way to have another drop on the opposite side of the stage. Currently my two S16's are mounted in my amp rack so I need to run cabling across or behind the stage to get to it. When I hooked up the SD16 as the last unit in the chain, the system did not recognize it at all and I had no control over it. The kicker was (and this is what threw me initially) the AES50 lights on my second S16 and the SD16 were solid green telling me that the setup was synced. At that point I started thinking that maybe I needed to update the firmware in my X32 in order to use the SD16. I bought the system together back in 2013 and really haven't needed to do any updates. 
The system has worked flawlessly since I got it. I went ahead and updated the firmware (from 2.5 to 2.16) and that still did not fix the problem. Here is where it gets really interesting. I started to think maybe there was a problem with the B port on my second S16 so I disconnected everything and hooked straight to the SD16. The X32 picked it up perfectly. No issues. I then hooked up the SD16 as the first box in the chain (X32 to SD16 to first S16 to second S16) and again it was picked up by the X32 and worked perfectly. The routing screen on the X32 showed the SD16 and both of the S16's.  I then thought maybe there was a problem with the second S16 in general  so I hooked up the first S16 to the SD16 and the same problem occured. Only the S16 showed up on the routing screen. 
This is when I called zZounds to see if they could help and they sent me to Behringer. The first tech I talked to at Behringer thought that maybe I had a bad cable so I swapped out all of the cabling and that did not fix the problem. I called Behringer again. The second person I talked to knew exactly what the problem was. Back at the end of 2014 there was a firmware update that was released for the S16 boxes that was not widely publicized. Also, as a side note, without having the S16 connected via USB there is no way to tell what firmware version you are running. I was on 1.1 and the new firmware is 2.2. I downloaded the new firmware (which has a PDF file telling you how to do the update) and ran it on both S16's. Everything works great now. 
The X32 sees everything and I have full control over the SD16 as the last box in the chain or wherever I decide to put it in the chain. I hope this helps some of you that might be having this same issue. I realize that many of you are probably running newer systems than I am but like I said earlier, I could not find ANYTHING on this issue ANYWHERE. Even in the Behringer forums. I'm pretty sure there are quite a few people out there running older firmware because unless you are using the X32 in a studio situation, most of the firmware updates that I have seen apply more to the studio environment that the live environment (which is where I am using my system). I hope this helps a few of you out there.                
I really like this little guy.  It's built like a tank, dead easy to setup and does what it's supposed to do. The XLR inputs are also much more durable than the locking ones on the X32's and the S16 stage boxes.  The built in Hi-Z inputs on the last two channels are a nice touch too and have eliminated two DI boxes from my setup.                
You can not go wrong for the price. This unit is truly well built with features and a sound you expect to pay double or even triple the price.                
It has 3 selections I like the middle position the best the top position is good and the bottom position is a boost and it works well kind of like a overdrive it boosts your signal. for those leads.                
4 knobs to twist and a 3way switch. COOL! /it is very good fuzz in my opinion, I have owned and/or own a big muff pi, fuzzbrite clone of fuzzrite very good no bass fuzz, I like the behringer because it has great high and low control and it sounds lik to me the fuzz sound I  was looking for.                 
Pick a selection 1,2 or3 and set up you tone and rock out!                
Not bad for plastic, hey i dont jump on my metal stomp boxes why would I do it to this one. Treat it good and it will treat u good.                
Best bang for your buck!!!!!!!!!!                
i dont know never needed them and I own 8 of them no problems                 
VERY SEXY PEDAL!                
BUY IT NOW!                
 I am a commercial sound system engineer and professional radio and mobile DJ and have designed audio equipment in the past. I own many different Behringer small format mixers and signal processors (including compressors, crossovers, eqs and exciters) which I bought over the years going back to the late 90s. I still have and use most of these products, they are rugged, reliable, have excellent specs and work flawlessly. It amazes me how Behringer consistently offers such top notch products with so much bang for the buck. I believe they are unique in their market segment.
 Overall, my early opinion of the new SPL3220 is equally favorable. I ran it through it's paces with commercially recorded music like that I would play on the air or at a gig and found that with it's dual band design it does a commendable job of taming dynamic volume swings and holding average program levels without the artifacts typical of the many single band processors available. It's packed full of useful features despite it's small size and price like the leveller, limiter, full metering, hard bypass, music or voice settings, and unbalanced or balanced XLR combo inputs/ outputs. Most of all, it's logically laid out and easy to operate despite it's complexity of functions. It should be invaluable for uses like mine or in PA and background music systems, production studios or for small broadcasters on a budget.
 My only reservations or nit picks concern the front panel design and lack of good documentation (owner's manual). The front face has an attractive hinged smoked plastic cover which may be prone to breakage by tampering, heavy use or impact. It also obscures the controls and meter illumination to a great extent. I prefer the more typical Behringer extruded aluminum open front face design. I think the unit should also come with a more comprehensive User's Manual as has been traditional for the company. This is a complex piece of equipment (albeit deceptively simple in control layout) which deserves more detailed background and useage information especially for those unfamiliar with compressors / limiters / levellers. I myself had to look at the block diagram on the specification sheet which i found on their website (under downloads for the unit) to understand the actual functions of the "Meter" and "Program" switches and "Leveller" knob. The "Meter" switch acts as a processor in/ out selector (it's actually a bypass), the "Program" switch selects the crossover frequency between the two processor bands (favoring either voice or music uses), and the "Leveller" knob increases the recovery time of the compressor effectively keeping the average program level consistent over a longer period of time.
 For the price and features of the SPL3220 though, you won't find a better product out there, that's what's so great about Behringer. I heartily recommend it.
It is a wonderful processor allows a lot of punch and great presence but I wish it had gating and more user adjustable controls.                
If you're looking for analog audio processing, it would be wise to completely pass on this product. Normally I really like Behringer gear, but not this piece. If you're looking for analog audio compression, limiting, or AGC (Automatic Gain Control), check into some of the older gear that really works, like the Aphex 320A Compellor, Aphex 720 Dominator II, Symetrix 422, or any of the DBX compressors. I had found that the Eurocom SPL3220 almost did nothing to the signal. It's too bad, as Behringer could have really come up with a box that was a powerful tool, unfortunately, they went in the opposite direction.                
The sound quality for this unit is awesome considering its price tag. It has much better sound quality (a much lower noise floor) than I have ever been able to get with a high quality computer sound card.                
The entire unit as a whole is a 'swiss-army' knife. Have not used the emphasis though. The SCMS removal is nice - it allows old consumer DAT-tapes to be redubbed. Analog RCA Inputs and outputs would be nice to add though.                
Use two of them back-to-back to send 2-channel stereo SPDIF audio through a building's CAT5 Ethernet cabling without picking up any AC hum or distortion. Very easy to use - no learning curve needed. Plug it in and your done.                 
Ask me that a year from now. The unit seems to be well made - has solid extruded aluminum rack mounts that will hold the unit securely in a rack. The buttons and switches seem like they will hold up.                
It's a great price thats affordable for starting musicians, which I believe that it's perfectly priced for this group of people who are most likely to buy this kind of equipment.                 
Easy to understand and use. Did not buy it for looks, but it's LED layouts and controls are easy to see and use.                
I can't see A/D - D/A conversion ever growing obsolete, especially with it's low noise floor. I wish I knew about this unit earlier.                
Best sound-to-dollar ratio DAC in the world?  Maybe. It does sound every bit as good as a Benchmark DAC1 even when driven with a cheezy S/PDIF signal from a cheezy consumer sound card.  I'm impressed.  I really didn't expect this much performance for the price.                  
It does everything.  DAC, ADC, SRC, digital patchbay- And the connectivity leaves me wanting nothing.  It even has a decent, though not great headphone pre.  I don't know of another product that has this feature set and all of this connectivity.                
Some of the lights and buttons could have been labeled with better, more appropriate and intuitive terms, but I'm used to it.  Took about a day for me to be 100% confident in using it, now it's a no-brainer and I use it with zero lag on my part.                
It's typical behringer, of course.  Dubious chinese build quality all the way.  Cheesy connectors, case and controls.  I wouldn't want to depend on it for a mission critical project, but for my own home use I'm 100% satisfied..As long as it doesn't catch on fire!                
I'd give it a 12 here.  Again, nothing else I know of does all this for 10X the price.                
I've had it a week, haaven't needed support.                
No sex appeal IMO.  Again, it's typical Behringer.  But the practicality and features made me want it and now that it's here, I'd never want to let it go...Well, when better chips come out I'll sell it.                
I still can't believe it retails for $129 and Behringer AND the retailer both make proffit.  Amazing.                
It's completely silent.                
It gets the DA/AD out of my PC.                
It's a little tricky to set up sometimes. It has forgotten its settings once in a while after a power cycle. But I usually set it and forget it.                
It's never given me any reason to doubt its quality.                
Worth every penny.                
Never had to deal with it.                
Prevents your recordings from sounding like a complete amateur.                
I've had this for several years, and it is great. It's totally silent, and totally reliable.                
The best I've heard so far... big step above my soundcard                
Great features but I wish it had rca outs                
Pretty straight forward                
Heave duty metal construction                
Considering it used to be $400 and now is $129 great deal                
good thorough manual                
Definately looks impressive matched up with my tube amp                
Great deal one of my  best audio purchases                
I am using the SRC 2496 to convert analog audio sources to digital for use in a high school television production studio. Always mindful of financial issues, this equipment has far exceeded my expectations for the cost. It is a great value.                
Gain can be adjusted for analog, but cannot cut/boost for digital.  If digital signal is high, a little distortion may be introduced.  I don't particularly find the "emphasis" all that useful, but your mileage may vary.  It's probably more intended for analog; I should read the manual.                
Top ratings because it does what it is advertised to do; nothing more, nothing less.                
No wall-warts.  This will stay in a rack in the studio.  I cannot attest to its durability on the road, although I don't know why anyone would take it with them.                
For digital-only connections, you'll get more features than the only other item in the price range, the ART DI/O.                
Haven't needed it, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.  However, I wish I didn't have to pay internation postage for the registration card.                
Behringer products look ... like Behringer products.  Surprisingly, aesthetically much better than the older SRC2000.  Of course, not even close to t.c. electronic in visual appeal, but it does what it is supposed to.                
I'll use this until it burns out.                
No difference to highend contenders...                
so many features in one slim module. awesome                
The manual is crap, should be rewritten from scratch.
Better to not read it and just start using: operation explains itself after several trial-and-error sessions                
The only minor quirk: mine gets switched on by an external power switch and sometimes resets some of its previously stored settings (like: digital input chosen last time used)                
no alternative on the market                
Not needed...                
I wanted it - and I own it                
The ADC section is quite clean and flat sounding, with a low noise floor.                
It might occassionally be nice to have standard unbalanced inputs like RCA or TS. Otherwise its got all the features I can imagine needing.                
Although I have heard others claim that Behringer's products are not reliable in their first release, I have never had anything go wrong with this or the other Behringer product that I own.                
This is a good value. The clean sound and the extensive features are pretty impressive given the price tag.                
Don't know how their support is because I never needed it.                
This is a practical unit that solves problems with different sampling rates, and converts to and from digital. It's not the kind of thing that has sex appeal. You buy it for its features.                
For a lot more money you can probably get a slight increase in dynamic range, a tiny bit less jitter, etc. But for anything less than a perfectionist, this is a great product at a great price, and I've been happily using it to make recordings.                
I am impressed. :) Amazing sound quality. Great frequency separation. Lots of power. Solid Monitors. Love them. And the price cant be beat. Get em.                
Incredible. Sound quality is amazing. Incredibly loud too, gotta turn them down when switching from other monitors. Got this along with stands and isolation pads and was able to pay 4 different payments, zZounds is by far the best dealer.                
Very satisfied with these speakers, they sound so clean!                
I do not know if there was something wrong with the pair I got of if it is an inherent poor design. However they picked up interference from everything and were so noisy they could not be used. Lights, WiFi, computer hard drive, power wires and even cars going by caused them to growl snap hum whirl etc. I even got mors code sounds coming over them. Secondly if they are to be used on a table in a recording situation they need to have covers or grills. It would be way to easy to push anything on the table into them and puncture a speaker. The sound when I did hear it was flat and they need volume controls. I am very disappointed in them.                
I think it sounds good. We are a church choir that sings at various venues. We have some other components that I would like to replace for sound issues, but not this board.                
It does everything I need for a group of 7-9 singers and 3-6 instruments.                
The controls are simple and intuitive.                
I had one input channel go out shortly after purchase, but I think it was my fault, over drove it a lot on accident and probably fried something. Never bothered to try and get it fixed because we were OK with one less channel most of the time. Otherwise it stands up to moves from location to location very well, still in the original cardboard box. Probably time to get a better case.                
I think the price/feature ratio on this thing is great. I use the FX processor a lot and it works great.                
I don't really know, never had to use it.                
It is clean, compact and very functional!                
We've had it for 3+ years and will keep it as long as it keeps going.                
This is a great little board for the $.                
I would give it a 10, but feel it needed more Aux sends for my needs.                
Super easy to use, right from the box.                
This is a great little board, built well, and rugged.                
I selected this board because it is the best "bang for buck" period.                
Have had no problems, but anticipate no issue with support due to the quality of the mixer for the $                
The small format makes this a great modular component piece.                
I'll run it till it quits turning on, then probably order another or the newer version.                
This mixer sounds great for the price.                
The effects on this are great.  I have had high school rock bands come and ask me if I could change how their voice sounds.  I also use this in the studio and the presets are great.                
This product is as easy as plug and play.  It takes me 10 min to hook this up.                
The knobs are all different.  Some stick some you don't need to touch to turn.                
I have not used the support yet.                
I think it sounds great, and it does everything that we need it too. The only thing I would like to see change is for the sound person to have controll over the echo amounts. He has to turn the sound down to avoid getting too many echos.                 
everything is great                 
very easy to get sounds. What zzounds needs to do when selling it is to tell the customer who does not have experience that he/she needs a power amp to make it work.                 
made great.                 
I only saw it sell for 10 dollars less than what I paid for it, but I did not have to pay for shipping, which made the diffrence up.                 
very                 
all the sound effects it gives                 
I would replace it ASAP.                 
Significant crosstalk, especially with strong signals.  The effects don't sound all that great.                
They crammed a ton of features into this board!
Faders and knobs are not very smooth or consistent. Signal indicators only light when signal hits about 0dB, unlike Mackie and Allen & Heath boards that have a meter bridge-like single indicator LED that illuminates at different intensities. As mentioned above, the 99 effects are mediocre, but there are two distinct channels/processors!  Could be some more aux sends.                
No complaints here!                
Immediately after I powered up the first board, the effects system started blinking like crazy and sending hissing, distortion, and clicking out the mains, even if I lowered all the FX knobs, master fader. There was no way to stop it (power cycling, holding both effects knobs in). The second board was fine. I returned the first board to guitar center with no problems. The replacement board worked great for 25 days until the same thing happened again!  Found other people with the same issue on some forums.
I would have been able to get past the drawbacks in some of the features, but I can't live with the chance of the effects crapping out again and lots of repairs in the future.  Let me be clear. The board is unusable if the effects systems fails.                
I decided to return BOTH boards to buy two Mackie CFX20 mkIIs. I had bought these Behringers for $499 ea and I decided to drop the extra 500 bucks to get the Mackies at $749 ea.  I'd say that the extra $500 is worth the long term investment for my church.  These get used at least 3 times per week, sometimes every day.  Got extended warranties too.                
Not used.                
Behringer has done a great job with the appearance of their products.                
I have to rate this so low because of two of the same failures in two new boards within 30 days.  If Behringer built a better effects system, these would be GREAT entry-level boards.  Spend the extra dough for Mackie or Allen & Heath.  I wish I did from the start!                
It's not a cadillac but it does the job I've had mine for two years 
we play 3 nights a week i have had no problem so far I do'nt understand why people complain so much for the price it's a good deal, do they know what the are doing                
best deal for the price                
I                 
It'nice and compact                
I think I'll be using it for a long time                
I bought this board to give me the room I need to do a full band.  I have a 12 channel Peavey, which I now hook up to one of the stereo channels, giving me a board for just percussion.  I love the versatility, low noise, optional plug-ins.  I can either go amped, or powered speaker, and the gains remain dead spot on.  Not much change from non/phantom power characteristics.  My only bad on this is the bleed through of the effect channels overrunning the pan/left/right sub-channels.  I like complete mutable control with one slide, and the orange knobs take that away.                
Really Great piece of equipment, easy to use and set up great effects and reliable                
The effects are awesome                 
Friendly Usefull                
Graet quality on design and manufactured                
Great price for what you get                
All the support of the world came with it.                
Is really loveable, design and look                
I believe is one of the best mixing consoles I ever use                
This board allows you to do a lot with it and if you know what your doing and know how to run sound this gives you a lot of board for the value.  This board has a lot of head room and channels are quite.  The only problem I had were the FX did not function but it was a blemished unit.  Had to send back and get another board.                
The Behringer SX2442FX Eurodesk works great in the studio.  Very quiet mixer and versatile.                 
I have been using this mixer for a few weeks in my job as soundman and it has never let me down. I have this one, the 32 channel version, a xenyx 2442 and a Yamaha MG series mixer that I use regularly. While I cannot recommend the Xenyx line for front line use, the Eurodesk line is ready for use in clubs, bars, churches and even at outdoor events. I have used mine at all these types of events with no issues whatsoever. Reliability and predictability of the gear allows me to concentrate on keeping levels straight and making sure nothing gets into the red and this mixer does that. The Xenyx one however, is prone to making noises you can hear through the speakers when you click buttons like PFL/AFL. I actually like using this mixer now because I know where all the buttons and faders I need are located and it has never failed me or even faltered. The sound is transparent as it should be and I have received many compliments (not on the gear) on the sound of the mix acheived using the mixer and Behringer DSP and amps. Some of the other soundmen seem honestly surprised to hear a clean mix come from this gear. It would have to be a pretty bad mixer for it to ruin my mix by itself. Overall it is quite good when used in a live situation. Sometimes I use the Yamaha mixer and QSC powered speakers on the job instead of this and you cannot tell the difference.                
Purchased for my church and was very impressed with the sound quality, number of channels, easy set up and flexibility. I have hooked up a QSC qx5 and powering two Yamaha 2-way speakers and Peavey monitors. Im well pleased with this product. dont understand how people continue to complain about this board especially for the price!!!!                
I bought this mixer because our band is growing, and we all decided to invest in upgrading our equipment. This looked like a great board, all the channels plus two effect engines sounded awesome. After getting this board and unpacking it, it lasted about 4 hours and the effects started to go on and off by themselves, cutting the sound on and off as it did this. It was very strange as I messed around with volume sliders trying to figure out why my sound died and then all of the sudden the sound kicked back in with the volume being way to loud, blowing the horns on my JBL speakers. Anyway the mixer finally just quit working all together after only owning it a few hours, the two effect engine lights remained off, and no sound at all.  I did some research and found this to be somewhat of a common problem that people have complained about. My question is; If this has been an issue for the last several years, why has Behringer not addressed this problem? my suggestion is don't buy it. Not only did I have to return it, but I had to get my horns repaired on my JBL speakers as the result of this product being faulty. zZounds was very good at the return, and I ended up going with a Mackie Profx22. It really looked like a great mixer, but I will be very hesitent to ever buy anything from Behringer again.                
Behringer products are great, until you touch them. I bought this console on a dare, and my friends are paying me back in installments.  The preamps are solid in construction, if you are talking about the construction of a light souffle! Use a feather or a toothpick to move the faders because seriously the wiring in this thing is 1 molecule thick and built by cheap nanobots.  If this console existed in space, operated by a weightless, invisible hand, it would be spec-perfect to a more expensive Mackie or comparable mixer. However, we live on Earth, where components need to resist stress, and last over time.  Everything you have heard about Behringer is true. It works, but all of a sudden, it doesn't!                
All the bells and whistles.                
A clone of a much better product.                
Shoddy components. Cheap plastic things all over it.                 
If you need something for one session and can't borrow something from a friend, buy this, use it once, and throw it in the trash. Your signals will be thin and compromised, but who can't fix it in the mix? I give this a big 2 fir Behringer's constant devotion to spot on mimicry of reliable products.                
You can't get them to help you. They just make things for beginners to use. It's a joke that they are manufacturing products at this high a level.  It's like getting a Formula 1 car from Yugo.                
It's like getting a fake Rolex. Need I say more?                
What a stupid idea. Seriously, what musician or engineer with any self respect would buy anything from this company except for a small accessory or a quick fix? No one with any sense would make a major purchase from this company.                
There is no downside to the sound of this board.  The preamps are transparent and quiet, special effects work great, plenty of headroom...everything you ask a mixer to do for your sound is there.  Making vocals and instruments sound the way they go in is extremely important, and this board is that way.  You can, however tweak everything to get whatever "version" of those sounds you want.                
It would be nice to have two more pre-fader sends, but at this price-point the existing feature set probably makes this too costly. By getting the 24 xlr versin, I create a third mix using the inserts to patch over to other unused channel line inputs.  Then I assign those to a subgroup or two and not to the mains.  The faders can be used to create the third or even fourth mix with some creative experimentation.  Direct outs could be good, but the inserts can be used as d/o, and for me it's enough.                
intuitive, well grouped controls.  well written manual, although I have previouss mixer experience.  I don't think anybody quite matches mackie in this department...user friendly manual, that is.  Behringer Online support is there for any questions. I can't think of an easier way to add a subwoofer than to use this mono out with adjustable volume and adustable lpf...in conjuntion with the adjustable hpf on my behringer eq...unbelievable difference in the clarity and power requirements of my system from this one feature.                
everything is perfect out of the box.  The controls are firm, with the faders the least firm, but very smoothe and controllable.  The fit and finish is on a par with everybody else...just fine.  I am not the least bit worried about the "horror stories" as they have simply become urban legend on the web.  My own personal experience with behringer, and local music store information has laid all these stories to rest around here.  How long will it last?  I don't plan to throw it arouns, so I expect years of usage.                
Hands down winner here.  Nothing else is even close.  You will find some used boards with more sends, but fewer channels, new boards with less of everything, any variation in-between.  Pound-for-pound, dollar-for-dollar..this board has more of the typical weekend-warrior needs covered for less money.                
I have never needed any supports except for simple questions...always a prompt, courteous response.                
It's gorgeous...maybe not exactly like the onyx is gorgeous.  A little more of a retro-gorgeous.  It is not, BTW a close cosmetic copy of the onyx if you are an observent person....a little siver here and there doen't make them look alike in my book.                
I have no inkling to look for a different mixer.  I shopped for 6 months and did extensive research to determine if the internet babble on three very vocal forums was really the majority opinion.  It is not. It is also not based on current information regarding behringer products or business practices. I bought this mixer because I am an educated consumer who knows what I want and what it's worth.  My music sounds better, my bands needs are now met, and this mixer is a key ingredient.  The common recommendation for a small mixer with 16 inputs and 6 sends is around $1000.  That is simply not a player for many folks.  Neither is a legitimate need or technical ability to use 6 sends. This board had 24 mono channels and so many routing options, a competent sound person will find the sends more than adequate for the weekend gig band.  I'd replace it with another one...or add a 2442fx or some xenyx version if the need for a monitor board ever arose...that beside this would be capability well beyond any reality I see in my forseeable future.                
I was very very surprised with this board. The first thing I did was have a custom flight case made for it by Islandcases out of New York and is a great flight case. This board is absolutely underrated. I use Mackie, Yamaha and Soundcraft boards and this board is every bit as good. It has a lot of head room and I like the fact that you can assign the onboard graphic EQ to the auxiliary buses. We use along with this board DBX's Driveracks. AS with anything as long as you take care of it and don't beat it to death it should last a long time. Behringer has come a LONG way. The 24 xlr channels are plenty and the sound is very clear. The British EQ's work exceptionally well with the DBX DriveRacks EQ. The effects are adequate but in all honesty this board would be better without them, it's just one more thing to go wrong and that's with any unit.                
No accessories except for the power  chord. As stated above the effects are adequate but the board would have been great without them as well.
I do wish there were optional gooseneck lights that could be connected to it.                
You will have to read up on this unit to get the best out of it.                
This board is well made. I'm starting to believe in Behringer products. I know their power amps are workhorses and absolutely great. That is the main reason I took a chance on this board. As long as it stays in it's case and not thrown around it will last a long time. It is nice and lightweight. It is road worthy and has been holding up.                
I got it at an EXCEPTIONAL deal. It is worth what the website has it listed for. I would another one if needed.                 
I'm not rating it because I haven't had to use it. I do need to email them about a question I have so we'll see how it gets handled.                
really no sex appeal just a very good mixing board.                
I should be using this board for sometime. IF anything I would look for a bigger board. IF it were stolen I would buy another one just like it. Behringer add optional gooseneck lights!!!!lol                
Actually, all those who complain about Behringer's quality they don't have even a single DI for themselves, in most cases... They just "talking" and they are very sure that can accuse Behringer, because it's just a cheap one company and its very easy to say : "It's Behringer and thats why it's bad...". When they ask for me to rent them my PA system for a live gig, they want to have the Nexo PS15, a Midas mixer, Neumann mic's, etc, and they want to pay 150$ for one night... Well for all those "i know everything and i want the best" guys, i have to tell this : The last 2 years Behringer make some new models that they are REALLY good, just like the Xenyx series. I have 3 Yamaha's digital mixers and 2 Xenyxs and some times i prefer to work with the Xenyxs. I will never buy a Mackie, a Soundcraft, or whatelse insted of a Xenyx. Period.                 
Everything is here. Many more features than others mixers in this category. Very good, very good, very good....                
If you know to work with a pro mixer, you don't have to take even a single look in the manual.                
As far as you power it on and still works it's just fine.                
If you have psychologicall problems when viewing the Behringer's logo, on your gear, take this tag out and put a Mackie one on. Then you gonna have it all...                 
I want to pay and buy something that will work fine and give me back some money. I don't want to pay Mackie's new factory, or the brand new Ferrari of Mida's chief president... After all they are all machines, it's not the meaning of life.                
This mixer works great, I'm picking up the features pretty quick, but theres still a TON that I have to learn. I bought this mixer for my studio, and I havent gotten to use it much with an entire band yet, but that will come later this year. So far I'm very happy with it. The knobs feel nice and firm, the sliders not quite as firm but still not bad at all. The buttons work well, and the effects processors do their job. the sound is really good with my rocket 5 studio monitors, and the whole thing is very quiet.                
The only thing I do not like about this board is it does not have monitor controls for individual channels. If I would have known that I would have went up a step. It wasn't clear about that and the picture wasn't large enough to see that by looking. Would really like to trade for the 3200.                
I bought this mixer only to find out a few months later it dropped channels. I had to pay to ship it to be fixed and when I got it back found out it had lost a group channel as a drummer this was a problem! I will never buy Behringer equipment again.                 
If you are a pro audio guy, like i am.. This thing is junk. if you are a young band looking for something to get you through. this will work well for you.                 
The built in effects are good to have. don't sound too bad.
The pre-amps suck! you have to push it to the limits if you are a loud music group.                
Easy to hook up and use. not a whole lot of Aux outs, but for a small venue, it would work.                
It is a disposible piece of gear. It's cost is great, but repairs cost more than just replacing it. Use kid gloves with this unit.                
The price is right for a toy... cause that is all this is. Learn on it and move on.                
What support!                
The best $25 I have ever spent on my guitar in nearly 30 years. Amazing pedal, it is a shameless copy of a Sans Amp pedal and it shamelessly does it with awesome accuracy. You can't beat this thing with a bat on the price. It's worth 3 times or more that easy. I have a variety of modelers and distortion boxes from Line 6, Digitech, Boss and E.H. even  a couple of stupid priced boutique pedals, this is as good and better than most of them at any price. I have bought a small handful of Behringer pedals recently and they have all found their way into my live rig, the Echo Machine the Reverb Machine and the Shifter/Harmonist are also very note worthy pedals. I don't know how they do it but from what I have heard I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone, they are an incredible value. As for being made of plastic, so what, it's not like I jump up and down on them, they seem very study and reliable.                
great distortion sound                
mode switch actoin a plus                
duh                
its made of plastic but i had this pedal for almost a year brought it to about 5 playouts and had no problems,course i leave this guy on the whole time!!!                
awesome value,most boxes like this would cost over 90 bucks!!!                
no support needed as of yet                
nice sound great price!!!                
great pedal for the price!!! goes great with my bugera 333 infinium half stack                
It has a warm tube-like sound.  It is very versatile, great marshall, mesa, twin tones.  I run it through a tube amp and a 2x12.  Thick with tons of distortion.                
It has mic placement, different gain positions and responsive bass and treble controls.                  
Easy to get great tones in minutes.                
It has a plastic case so I woundn't jump on it, but it has lasted for the past 5 months no problems                
It is a clone of SansAmp GT-2.  but it cost 75% less.                
never had an issue.                
It is the Jcm900 tone I was looking for.                
I would buy one every month if I needed to.  If it had a metal case it would be perfect.                
The TM-300 gives you a full guitar preamp with bass & treble, master volume and overdrive, and a variety of amp models for $25, which is astounding. You can plug straight into a powered speaker or a PA and get a true guitar tone without having to haul another amp along. It doesn't have the digital delay effects of a Line 6 Pod or a V-Amp, but it does the job conveniently and cheaply in a way that makes it a near necessity for live shows.                
This is a hidden gem AT ANY PRICE!! If the price seems to low. go get the trans amp version of this pedal it cost way more. This is a real deal. IT doubles as a di box or distortion pedal and the tweak ability giv it a wow factor.  I would get it again in a heart beat if i had to. yes its plastic but hey its priced rite.                 
When the description for Behringers TO800 Vintage Overdrive pedal mentions the 4558 IC I know they're referring to the chip used in what I consider one of the most iconic pedals in Guitardom. Clueless? Were talking about the TS-808, TS9, TS10, TS7, TS5, etc. The TS series is the most collected, written about, and modified pedal out there. I was a relative late-comer to TS mania and it was the early 90s when I got a TS5. Its the same circuit as the original but cheaper components, a plastic case, and its not a collectable, but it produces the same soft clipped harmonic distortion that the early versions are lauded for. Jump to present and Behringer who produces inexpensive clones of many popular pedals. With my curiosity killing me, I ordered the TO800 and it arrived in two days. I hooked up the TO800 and my TS5 and A-Bed them at the same settings. Shazaam, shazaam! I cant tell the difference. The Behringer TO800 nails it! Yes the case is plastic and battery cover removal is a bit quirky but I use it with an external supply and I dont throw or drop my pedals. Get othe sound? for a song and a dance.                
Simply a no brainer at this price. After reading many reviews, I gave it shot and was blown away. I put it side by side with my buddy's TS9 and it was virtually identical. The difference was placing the drive past 9 O'clock. At this setting it has a little more distortion which gives it an almost two in one effect. While the TS9's metal casing will hold up longer, I find no reason to spend $80 more for it. The plastic casing is of high quality industrial strength and I have kicked the dung out of it and it has held up. I have a Tubulator MTE-1 which I dislike and never use but decided to use it in unison and the sounds that I can get are amazing. I am running it through my Super champ X2HD and cabinet on the straight tube clean channel 1 and it has turned it into the most versatile amp I have ever had. Behringer has come along way and they are making some good stuff now. Buy this pedal and it may be the best $20 bucks you've spent.                
Of course everyone will compare this with the legendary Tube Screamer. Well let me tell you it is pretty close to being one in the same. I viewed a you tube video of this and an actual tube screamer being played and that was what sold me on this product. Please keep in mind that this is not a distortion pedal it is a tube pedal. It offers a tube crunch sound for the most part unless cranked up then of course it becomes a distortion pedal. I love the tone of it and even though I have an overdrive section on my amp this is much superior to that. Am I worried at all about the plastic housing of it absolutely not and at a price of $19.99 believe me there is nothing to think about.                
Great pedal for the money. This is an awesome little pedal. I am running my PRS Custom 24 through my Marshall MG100FX. Awsome sound. Would give 5 stars if the pedal came with ac adapter. I did not like this pedal not coming with a power chord. You must remember to turn it off if running it on battery power.                
I've had the TO800 for a few months. I'm basically a Jazz Guitar Student who plays mostly clean. However, I was looking for a bit of fatness & sustain without getting into a Metal or 70's Rock sort of tone. The TO800 does the trick by applying a bit of sweet distortion and noticeable sustain. The application of this box makes soloing a bit easier and more controllable than playing totally clean. I'm using an Ibanez ASF75 thin hollowbody on the neck pickup and really like the results. It's Unbelievable for $20 bucks.                
For the price it's definitely worth the purchase. Sounds absolutely amazing. Nice for blues distortion on clean channel and boost on your distortion channel in your amp. The material is made out of plastic. Feels really cheap. Be careful installing the battery. It was a mystery to me. I almost brokeit trying to figure it out. Watch a YouTube video on how to do this. If it broke I would definitely buy another one.                
I have limited use in my country style but when I need it,,,,,,,,it's there in a big way.                 
Standard size, fits my board nicely, nothing bad to add.                
I keep it set to the same settings.                
I have no issues with this nor my other 9 pedals all Behingher.                
Far superior.                
never used it                
I can always use another sound.                
I would replace it.                
This pedal is well worth the effort and money.                
This is a nice pedal.  It's simple to use.  It's got a great sound.  AND it's tougher than you think.                
Works as advertised. You just need to tweak it to your sound of choice. 
As for me, I had to lower the gain setting of my tube amp to make the overdrive work and give your notes some boost and sustain.                 
The drive and the tone to me are the useful settings. I don't like to turn up the level knob high because it makes the amp really noise and it cause too much hiss and hum.                
3 knobs, it's easy as 123 to use this thing.                
It's  a compact size but only thing Behringer could do better is get these pedals changed to metal such as aluminum, which is the case mostly for leading brands of pedals these days.                
ZZounds customer service is outstanding                
I put together a pedal board with 6 Behringer pedals and the PB600 pedal board and didn't even spend $250.00. Yes there plastic and yes there inexpensive and yes there from Behringer but forget about that and try these pedals. As for this tuner well unless your just unlucky or maybe don't know how to tune your guitar even with a tuner this thing is great. Just as good as a boss or any other. I play 100 shows a year and have been using this out on gigs with no problems. It's easy to use and easy to see with a nice bright light and it's at a real attractive price.                
No affect on sound quality.  It seems to also failsafe, when it dies, it still passes signal through.  That's important, so keep reading...                
Seems like a great tuner.  When it works.                
It's a tuner.  Not too complicated.                
Absolutely without a doubt the worst made product in the history of mankind.  Bought one from here at zzounds, brought it to practice, it worked fine.  Brought it to a gig 2 days later on a saturday night, hit it, everything went fine.  Between songs i went to double check tuning, and after i hit the pedal, it acted like i'd just plugged a cable in, then reset.  Every.  single.  time.  RMAed it.  Got a new one.  Brought it to practice.  Worked the first time.  Next time, I hit it, and it starts blinking "0" on the LED, on and off.  The rate sped up over 30 seconds or so, and eventually it just stayed on.  Garbage, complete garbage.                
$30 for a brick.  You're better off at home depot.                
Dunno, zzounds was great for RMAs.                
Sexy products work.  This doesn't.  DNW.                
After years of relying on my onboard tuner on my Alvarez, I purchased a new guitar without a built in tuner. So I decided to grab a pedal tuner for playing gigs. The TU300 seemed to have many of the same features as the BOSS tuner that my friends all use, but at a much lower price. Also, I have had good luck with other Behringer products that I use in my DJ set up so I thought I would give it a shot. This was a MISTAKE. I have not been happy with it from day one. The plastic casing makes me worry that I am going to break it every time I step on it. The battery is a huge pain to change. When it actually works, it takes forever to register the string you are trying to tune. 75% of the time, it won't even register my low e. I would have returned it, but the stream/cent button disappeared after I used it the first show after I got it. I would never buy another one.                
when i rate the sound, i mean how well it actually tunes the guitar, which is pretty good.                
pretty much the same features the Boss tuner has, just a lot cheaper.                
pretty easy to use all of the functions.                
quality is ok, its made outta plastic, so you kinda have to be a little carefull with this pedal.                
for the price i guess its pretty good, however, registering the notes is a bit on the slow side.                
behringer is a pretty good company. They always answered my questions.                
considering i have it, its honestly not the best pedal tuner out there.                
like i said, it tunes your guitar/bass. But it does take a few seconds to register each note, which is a pain to tell you the truth.                
N/A                
INCL. A PURPLE PATCH CORD. HAS 7 TUNING MODES; I ONLY USE 3.                
VERY EASY TO USE; JUST AS EASY AS THE BOSS TU-2.                
METAL BASE,BUT PLASTIC CASE. HOEVER I FOUND THE PRODUCT HEAVY,STURDY BUILT,AND FEEL IT WILL LAST ME A LONG TIME, AS I AM CAREFUL WITH MY GEAR.I AM MY RODIE SO I TRUST IT WILL FAIR WELL GIGING.                
PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH THE ASKING PRICE; BUT HEY IT IS A BEHRINGER!                
HAVE HAD NO NEED FOR CONTACT SO FAR.                
I LIKE THE COLOR,LED S ARE EASY TO SEE EVEN IN LOW LIGHT. FOR THE PRICE IT JUST MAKES GOOD CENTS. AND THE D#+N THING WORKS!                
AGAIN, THE COLOR IS COOL,LED S ARE GREAT, IT WORKS, AND IT COSTS A THIRD OF WHAT A BOSS TU-2 DOES. I THINK I WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE AS A BACK-UP. ENOUGH SAID!!                
This tuner has sound although it should not have sound, it should be true bypass as stated, and the sound it has, no, its not good                
Yes, its got all the features a tuner should have. I would like to mention the bright blue light which is so strong that the actuall display showing the note is hard to see                
Its difficult to change the battery in this tuner, other than that its just a bit more difficult to use than professional tuners because with the Behringer you don't know if its on or off, so you have to rely on the monitor system or backline, Registering the notes on this tuner is really slow                
Its Behringer quality, if you are lucky it still will work tomorrow                
You get what you pay for, but with this tuner you get even less                
Their support is bad - really bad                
I had it, I gave Behringer a chance. But I gave it as a present to a young beginner and bought myself a professional tuner                
Overall - well it's typical Behringer                
Well, its a tuner, does it have a sound, it should not have a sound but should be bypass, Unfortunately it does have a sound, and this is bad.                
Yes, many features, but in a tuner you only need one feature, this is to be able to tune your guitar or bass. Features is one thing, quality is another.                
This tuner is not easy to use. To change the battery is a major operation, the blue LED is too strong, therefore it is difficult to see the display. Also, this tuner is slow, very slow                
Its Behringer quality, if you are lucky it still will work tomorrow, but I wouldn't bet on it.                
The thing is cheap, but you still get less than what you pay for                
Behringer support is terrible, they do not want to know                
I had it but gave it as a present to a kid that is just beginning to learn guitar.                 
If you want a good tuner, do not buy this one. Actually, do not buy anything with the name Behringer on it if you want quality                
Pretty nice sound but it's disposable. Anything made of plastic, even heavy plastic like this pedal, will eventually break. I'm going to take the electronics out and put in a metal housing and add true bypass to get rid of the cheap housing. Overall, I'm not unhappy with this pedal. It does what it's supposed to do and sounds good. You get what you pay for.                
I could probably get better sound for a few hundred bucks! It eliminated all the ambient noise I was dealing with.                
It doesn't have any features; its a box.                
It would have been easier if I didn't have to find out THAT IT DOES NEED A DRIVER!! That information (and software) would have been useful. (Go to the Behringer website, it's all there right next to where it says "No drivers needed.")                
It's solid as a rock, and lighter than one, too!                
This does what I could've spent a ton of money on. I am finishing up my second CD using this thing! Awesome!                
Again, driver info.                 
It's a square box with a tail; how sexy is that?                
I hooked up a small 8 channel sound board to it and record using Adobe Audition. It is an incredidible value. Very, very happy!                
This product gave me a clearer, better quality sound than my laptop's audio did. Allows me to record from external audio sources in high quality stereo, with minimal noise (-32db and better).                
The features are perfect for getting stereo audio into your laptop (or desktop) via the USB port. Also, it allows me to hear playback from my sequencer on the laptop (via USB in, RCA out to amp) while at the same time allowing me to hear the synth I'm playing (via RCA out to amp), so behaves in a similar way to live mixing, although crude. I couldn't detect any latency at all.                
Let the PC boot up completely, then plug in the device and XP will detect it and add it as a human interface device (just like a USB mouse), no need for additional drivers. Just plug the L/R RCA OUT to your amp, mixer, hi fi, or tape machine and the USB to your laptop. You can use an audio switch box with this device to switch between audio inputs if you don't have a mixer.                
Plastic, but solid feel, fine for the price.                
I paid AU$60 new. Good value product for what it does.                
Have not used support yet, but their website gave a reasonable description and contact info.                
I had to have it for my setup. A practical way to get audio via USB into laptops and desktop pc's.                
This product is a permanent, integral part of my home studio setup, and will be used for the long term.                
I must say the sound on this unit is quite pristine.  I only had to adjust the input level of the USB in my sound profiles under control panel to get the playback at the right volume.  Other than that the sound is smooth and crystal clear.                
It is a very basic unit, I wish it had more features but for $30 you can not go wrong.  I run a boss BR-8 and drum machine directly into the RCA ins on this unit and it works wonderfully.                
So simple to use.  Plug and play truly.                
So far it seems fine.  It is made of plastic however and that is fine with me because it will just be used at home for desktop recording.  I would of course have preferred a metal casing but for the price who cares.                
Again, $30 is pocket change for a USB audio interface.  This is a no brainer if you want a simple unit like this.                
Can not rate this, have not contacted them on this unit.  But I also own a Virtualizer and had some questions regarding it and they were friendly and quick with a response.                
It is kind of cool looking for what it is, I guess.                
I love this thing so far, hope it does not fail.  But if it does, I will just replace it, it is cheap enough.                
It obviously does nothing in the way of processing effects etc, nor has any noise canceling, so there is no sound improvement. I have had no troubles with sound quality whatsoever with this, and being an audiophile that says a lot about the product. Overall, very good.                
Does *exactly* what it says on the tin. Its not the very latest in technology, and certainly not fun to use... but then again it is not designed to be. It is practical and does exactly what it needs to do, and it does it well. On the bonus side, it does have optical out which is very nice to see.                
Its as simple as plugging it in and playing. No problems at all, although I did manage to roll back the drivers... which resulted in needing to reinstall the drivers (there *are* drivers available from the Behringer site) which led to being unable to use it temporarily - I just rebooted and everything was fine again.                
Its a small plastic box. It feels quite plastic and lightweight, something a little more weighted is always nice. The silver is not appealing, black would have felt more professional. Despite this, as I have said it is meant to be practical, not sexy. It feels reasonably tough though, I would have no problems using it on-the-go daily!                
Great value, Its most certainly worth $20... although I can't say that I would pay much more.                
The Behringer site gives all the information required, and really there is not enough features to fail! In most cases (in fact practically all cases) the problem is the fault of the user! Read the manual, notices and FAQs!                
Its not sexy, however it is designed to do a job... A job which it does well. Put it this way, I wanted it therefore I brought it. I didn't buy it because it looks cool or it has the latest technology.                
Does exactly what It claims to do, no more than that! On the bonus side, you gain access to a bunch of software from Behringer upon purchase!                
I am a tango DJ. My Mac "lost" a sound channel and the genius bar suggested this unit which for all practical purposes restored both channels. Much cheaper and better than getting a new computer. I've used it for more than a year, and I never dj without it. Original Tango recordings can be hissy, scratchy and thin, but the Behringer provides much better sound (in Buenos Aires,  other dj's commented on how good my sound was) . Highly recommended. At this price, I bought a second one as backup  and have not had to use it yet.   Phone support was immediate and terrific! One of the best things I ever bought!                
Sounds fine, no problems yet.                
My only real complaint is that there is no easy way to monitor the input through the output. It seems the only real way to do this involves using software playthrough, which creates a good deal of lag. The 1/8" monitoring output helps with this, but it would still be a nice thing to have.                
I was able to set it up and have it running in just a few minutes.                
Plastic chasis, but seems sturdy enough.                
Easily the best you will find for the price.                
No problem yet, haven't contacted them.                
Nothing spectacular. Could add a bit of color to your desktop, I guess. But it certainly isn't fugly.                
Suits my needs perfectly.                
crystal clear, just had to lower it a bit                
does what it does and does it well. i'd prefer it was a 4X4 but that's asking too much. i'd like to be able to separate the volumes for in and out(wait, in never changes does it? *slaps self). i will find out later

got me?                
solid product, don't care about it being plastic i'm not a child i know how to treat things. though the top sticker peeled a bit i might have done that thinking i'd paint it i don't know                
30 bucks barely gets me a single shoe. my last one got an ant colony inside it and replacing isn't a problem                
never had to use it, for any of their products. speaks for itself                
looks ugly, but anything not wearing a bikini is ugly to me.                
suits my initial needs to a T, windows linux mac it was useful for anything. as far as i can tell this thing is in it's own category: disposable(practicaly) soundcard                
To configure U-CONTROL UCA202 for laptop with Windows 7 ( which was normally configured for mono mic input ).
(CLICK THE FOLLOWING)
START (bottom left on your screen)
CONTROL PANEL
SOUND
RECORDING
(if your recording has been mono up to this point, the only recording input that you will probably see is a Microphone and if you have your U-CONTROL UCA202 plugged into a USB connector on your laptop, you should then, also see - "2 - USB Audio CODEC" slightly grayed under it).
Double click this icon - (Microphone)
(microphone properties should open)
(and here is where the magic is)
Click ADVANCED
There should be many many choices here to select from.
I have selected "2 Channel 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)" for myself.
afterwards - click "APPLY" then "OK".
And NOW - your laptop mono input should see the stereo inputs from your 
U-CONTROL UCA202.
Since most laptop sound card chips, have been designed to get the best sound level using "automatic gain control" and the input to this chip has been designed to be a microphone level, anything louder will be distorted. So you will probably need to open up a portion of your sound card software and make an adjustment to the INPUT level. Normally, you might find a tiny speaker in the lower right area of your screen. After you right click it, you should see something marked "recording devices". After clicking on recording devices, you should see a tiny microphone that has already been setup as the "Default Device". After double clicking this Microphone, you should see either one, or another series of 
selections. Next click "Levels" and that should provide you with a tiny fader bar that you can slide back and forth. Most Microphone levels can be adjusted from zero to one hundred. Since the input to the audio chip can not be modified, 
you will need to slide it down to about 5. After clicking the fader once with your mouse, you should be able to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to increase or decrease the fader value. After setting it to 5, make certain that you select "Apply" then "OK". Setting your input level to 5, will allow you to get a rather nice stereo recording, instead of a distorted one. 
A good source to connect the inputs of the U-CONTROL UCA202, is an external mixer that music and a microphone can be mixed with. An expensive music source device, like a MP3 player, can be connected to one of the external mixers input. There are many different brands, makes, and models of mixers. Some with a series of built-in effects for the voice, such as echo and reverb. 
Dealing with an external USB audio adapter for your laptop is really a first step into mixing and recording your voice with music. And getting a mixer that suits your production and monetary needs, will go a long way too.
If you have a recorder software program, record a few seconds of a stereo sound, then play it back to confirm that you can now record in stereo on your laptop.
If you do NOT have any type of Recorder Software, goto
 - - - http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ - - 
and Download Audacity. The version at this time is 2.0.3...
Its extremely friendly and quite flexible and you can even put the .EXE file onto a flash drive and load it onto other computers.
A lot of people like to save their recordings in the MP3 file format. First time users of Audacity will find that another .EXE file is needed for this part and can also be found at the same "Audacity" location above. There are already, many websites telling you that Audacity does NOT contain any viruses, malware, or trojans. But I 
always create a "Restore Point" before loading any .EXE files in my PC - just a word to the wise.
Have fun everyone.....                
Sounds as good as the tapes that it is digitizing......Very Good                
Everything you need to digitze audio, except the software. I use Audacity, which is free, to create the digital recording.                
You plug it in and it works. (using Windows2000 Pro)                
A plastic box the size of a deck of cards. Has not given me any trouble.                
For less than $30, this is too good a deal. Nothing even comes close.                
Has not needed any yet. But there is info (manual) on their website.                
Very practical, not sexy.                
Highly recommend.                
I have this connected to my iMac to replace the connection from the headphone jack to my mixer.                
A nice feature is an input which I use for my Dell XPS Desktop.  So now I have both Mac & PC hooked to my mixer                
Just plug it in.  No drivers, no hassle.  You do have to change your Sound Preferences.                
It seems pretty well made                
Well worth the price                
NA                
It's not the type of product you normally want to show off but it does its job well in the background.                
Hopefully, this will last for a few years.                
The sound is a HUGE upgrade to the line input recording I was doing.  I record using Audacity and it worked great.                
I really wish it had a 1/4 inch input rather than the RCA inputs.  Other than that it's pretty easy to use.                
Plug and play                
Pretty reliable.  I am on the road with it twice a week and haven't had a problem yet.                
Great value priced entry with great quality.                
Did not deal with customer support                
Ehh...not really nice looking but who needs that.                
I am using this product to along with Audacity software to transfer my Vinyl to my IPod.  For the low price this unit works great, sounds great.  No noise that my old ears could hear.  Well worth the money.                
For the money you can't really expect to many toys in the form of features.  This unit is bare bones but does what it should and that is to allow you to get audio in and out via USB.                
Plug it in and go.  No drivers needed for XP.                
Not a single problem out of the box.  Made out of plastic but thats ok for the price                
Not had to use any so i can't really say anything                
Not pretty but something that works well does not have to be "Pretty"                
I love this thing. Simple to use, works, quiet, allows stereo inputs for my laptop (which does not have stereo sound card) does what is should                
I have a radio show, for which I record live performances of local bands. I've been looking forever for a device or software to optimize using my laptop for ultimate ease and portability. This device, ROCKS!! Awesome sound, and the true blue cure for 'wahwah' when trying to record on a laptop. I had been told I needed a mixer, and someone else told me I needed an external sound card, etc,etc.  This product, which by the way was an awesome deal at a price match with another website (thank you!!) and I would recommend this to anyone in need as I was. Perfect USB device!                
Came with RCA cables.  All I had to do was buy an inexpensive adapter to be able to plug into a quarter inch jack                
See note above. Virtually effortless. Plug and record!                
(no vendor interaction)                
Sounds Great. I run it through a mixng board , sounds way better that going from mixer direct to PC. I would say all of the hiss and noise is cut out. Only thing I her is any abiant noise of the room, which is due to my levels not the interface.                
Its pretty good. There's not a whole lot to it, 2 RCA I/o left and right. And  a headphone jack with a monitor on off switch which comes in handy. Also a optical port, which I dont use, and thats it. It dosnt have a lot but it more than makes up for it.                 
Like I said theyre is not a lot to it. All I had to do was plug in and go, no drivers no adjustment, I record on A Dell 8200 laptop, and it worked perfect.                
The onlyreason I give an 8 is because its made of plastic, Granted Im not going to be throwing it arounf But I would have liked to see at least aluminum. Other than that all the jacks seem solid. I've only had it 2 days though. Real quality is shown over time.                
If you want to run analog recoding equipment to a PC with the best sound possible this is by far the bet way I have tried, and the sound is great, clear and no delay at all when recording.                
havnt needed it, its easy to use.                
Its an interface, Brains over beauty I suppose.                
There are more expensive ways to get a good sound, But if you know what your doing with your recording sdoftware you can get really close to pro sound on this. For the money it cant be beat, I have used units similar to this that cost $300 or more and I cand tell the difference as far as sound quality goes. The only thing lacking would be Features.                
I changed my lap top from an IBM Think pad to a more modern laptop. The new laptop did not have a line in jack! Arrrgh! I bought several little devices that plug into the USB, and they all had problems. I ended up buying a Zoom H4 recorder and audio interface. $300 at the time. A fine instrument, expensive though. I did not want to leave the H4 at the church, so when I was not there, there was no recording. Then I found the Behringer audio interface. At $36 or so, I can leave it on the sound system so that anyone with a laptop can use the system to make recordings. No buttons to push, no knobs to twist, just plug it in. I think I have already reviewed the UCA202. - I bought the UCA222 and I will be testing it this week or next.                
I use this for spoken word recordings.  I connect a mic by XLR to a small mixer, send it to one channel, and connect that channel's output via an adaptor to the left channel input on the UCA-202.  The sound when recording is far superior to what I get if I connect the mixer to the line in jack on my Dell laptop; on playback, through headphone or even on computer speakers, sound quality is noticeably superior than through the native sound card.  My only complaint is an occasional glitch on playback, just a momentary dropout.  I've never seen it happen on recording, though.                
Obviously, for my purposes, I would prefer this come with XLR inputs and phantom power and 1/4 inch jacks, but what do you expect?  Couple it to a Behringer mixer and you get a USB audio interface that satisfies my needs much more cheaply than any alternative.                 
I plugged it into a USB port on my Vista-running laptop, and it takes over input and output duties. Done.                
Kind of flimsy-feeling, but it has held up well for eight months with no problems.  You can't expect a steel case for $30.                
Well worth it if you need digital input.                
Haven't had to deal with it. The Behringer website provided useful information and software, but it's worked perfectly since I got it.  That's the best kind of support, IMO.                
It's a box with RCA and mini jacks. Oh, and a cord. And a little light. Just a generic USB dongle.  It could be a USB pencil sharpener.                
Until the computer I use for recording comes with a better sound card that this product, I will keep using it.                
I Purchased this unit to transfer my LP's to mp3. It works great. I just hooked up rca cables to it from my stereo out, attached the usb to my laptop. The sound generated is great. I used software by Free sound recorder i obtained from download.com I am very pleased!                
As abvertised the unit works great and ease of operation can't be beat!                
Very easy to configure and use.                
Quality seems good. I was surprised.                
Very nice value. Units i found at best buy were 3 times the price.                
Havent had to use support yet.                
It is small and easy to use.                
only basic features but they are the necessary and they work perfectly                
very easy - plug and play works, but for VST and Reason download the driver from Behringer's web-site.                
seems solid enough though the headphone output could be a bit more solid                
The best thing for the money - similar products cost around 100 pounds - three times as much                
best 30 pounds ever spent - just needed it for low latency midi recording and a digital input form mu preamp - GREAT!                
don't know if i should give it a 10. sounds very good. i listen through Behringer Truth B2031A active studio monitors and the sound is really nice.                
simple and it works. that's good.                
well, ... it's pretty simple.                
for the price, it's a well made. feels good.                
good price.                 
i'm assuming...                
for the kind of very good music sound i want yes.                
very good interface. simple. windows xp recognizes it automatically, and it overrides other audio out, which was my case.                
I just got done with a nightmare trying to get Lexicon's Omega to work here on my PC. That was a complete waste of $300! This unit does indeed sound just as good (for under $30). This is how to get sound in and out of your computer.                
A true ten as there are no features, no drivers, nothing to muck up the works. Simple, useful sound equiptment, what a concept!                
Just plug it into your USB port. So simple it's just a complete no brainer!                
Though I have little to go on here, I have bought many items with the Behringer name and always been very pleased with their capability.                 
for this price I could justify buying one a month (it would still end up cheaper than that crummy Lexicon).                
I have talked to them on a number of occasions reagarding other equiptment and always found them to be freindly and available.                
It's small, cute, out of the way. What more could you ask for.                
This product is serving me far better than a $300 Lexicon Omega (crap)                
Despite the compact size the sound is terrific.                
Only what you need.                
Connect it....use it....nuf said.                
Can't beat it for the price.                
Little "cheezy" with the plastic case, but it works.                
It does what it's designed to do.                
As long as it keeps working, I'll keep using it.                
For anyone using an older Mac mini or Laptop as an "apple TV"...this product is awesome... digital optical out for full surround sound capability..streaming music and vids to the home theater ...great sound..no latency. Stop using the headphone jack and get the most out of your machine! USB audio codec..not software to install. plug and play!                
NA.                  
Like others, I would have liked to have seen it made from something other than plastic, but I don't entend on treating it very rough anyway.  For the money you just aren't going to find anything better.                
Just plug it up and go.  Nothing to it.                
Again, made of plastic, and the USB cable is hardwired.                
t any better price.                
Haven't needed it for this piece of geer, but I have delt withBehringer before, and they have a has great support team.                
I love this little box.  The sound chip was going out on my Dell laptop, and I use it to play break music with, so had to either find a solution or have the laptop repaired.  I'm glad I chose to buy the UCA202!  Far superior sound quality than the chip inside my laptop, and cheaper than having the laptop sent off for repairs.  I would definately buy another, and intend to do so.                
had problems recording to computer from Fostex Multitracker once I added the Berhinger interface the strange phase style sounds disappeared and I was back in bussiness                
The Interface took care of all the problems. Before, when I recorded onto my laptop, It was overdriving,(sounded kinda like your singing in water). I have clean sound now. I use it on my Behringer mixer, I have also used it on a Peavey mixer also.                 
Just plug it in.                
It's O.K., I wouldn't want to drop it, (It's plastic).                
Way less than other interfaces I found.                
It's hard to talk to someone.                
It's a tool, no more, no less.                
This will be it. It does the job. I'm happy.                
sound is just fine                
has no features, but it is not supposed to
many have said here "has no drivers". well, it actually uses the microsoft usb drivers that come with windows. this is NOT the way to go for people looking to do software instruments, for that you need asio drivers.

For some reason, it sounds find on the USB1.1 ports on my desktop, but when used on either USB2.0 port on my laptop, it sends an annoying hum that is above 60Hz and therefore can't be eliminated with your usual rumble filter. It didn't cost much but I wasn't expecting such a problem, especially considering the D-A SNR was listed as being >89dB! I was planning on using this for mobile recording, but now it's relegated to emergency duty.                
A chimpanzee and an intern could figure this thing out. :-)                
It's a Behringer so it's well-built. It does what it does consistently, just not up to a high standard.                
It is cheaper than most items that promise to do the same thing, and therefore is a reasonable bargain. Aside from the hum, or perhaps I should say in addition to it, it delivers great sound.                
I am already searching for another product to do what this one does -- but without hum in a USB2.0 port.                
Accept only line level signals, so it's better to have some kind of mixerwith preamp to accompany - so you could record guitar or mic. Doesn't include limiter or something similar - so be carefull with levels - too much and you'll have nasty clipping (even I don't like it). Better the fidelity of incoming signal - the better result, I think every AD converter would add some static(it has no movement opposed to analog) to the sound (mostly because its hum/hissless)                
I give 5 because I hate RCA plugs, and probably hate them to the rest of my life - I tried to make 1/4 plugs , so i'd had to put it in the bigger enclosure, but during process i burned out little UCA. I really feel myself bad about that. But nonetheless i'll buy second one.                
OK. If you just plug it you will get windows driver (wich is bad). SO you'll have to go the BEHR site and take their ASIO driver. When it came out i was almost crying. I could actually play with REAL 2 ms delay! ASIO4ALL - was liyng to me saying 64ms (actually its about 14ms with ASIO4ALL). Well , for waiting of new ASIO drivers i give 5.                
Its surisingly good built. The output level is good (thanks to the JRC386 amplifiers).                
I bought it for 20$ (the UCA200 version). I really hope these guys have some left for 20$. If not - 50$ isn't that much to pay.                 
Haven't dealt with them. Though here its not the case when warranty will help.                
Neutral. If you want to make sound than it is very appealing.                
Only 2 channels in, 2 channels out. RCA plugs. Good ASIO.                 
sounds great, but i'm not audiophile.                
can't really say much bad stuff about this, though it would be nice to be able to route to the individual L/R outputs and headphones, rather than just a single stereo output and headphone monitor. that is, it'd be nice to see separate outputs for each one rather than having to pan the channels to achieve the same thing.
when i'm not using it for live sound, i use it as my laptop's sound card so i can use optical out. works flawlessly in linux, which is totally awesome.                
plugged in, worked first time in both windows and linux (actually better in linux)                
nothing wrong here -- i use it during band practice and live shows. holds up fine.                
surprisingly awesome for $35.                
smaller than i thought.                
Absolutely atrocious sound.  While the signal maintains harmonic integriy, my immediate gripe is a signal flow issue.  The RCA leads aren't properly grounded, resulting in signal interference and noise modulation... attempted with multiple RCA cables to no avail.  I would rather haul my turntables and mixer inconveniently across the country to a ProTools box instead of using this.                
Theoretically, it has the features one needs.                
I managed to plug in all the cables.  As for getting results?  None.                
It would have a qualty score if it actually sent audio into the computer for recording.                
Biggest mistake of a purchase in my life.                
Contacted Behringer...support was helpful, it failed the resolve the "no-input onto the computer system" issue.                
Giving it a 5 because cosmetically and ideally, it has the appeal.  In implemenation however, it fails completely.                
This thing is noisy. Just moving it around makes noise like a live mike.                
The headphone line out is not loud enough to do anything with.                
Plug it in and it works                
Made extremely cheaply, like all Behringer products, but some of Behringer products actually do a decent job                
Waste of $30.00                
I'm not going to bother to call.                
A small unit like this would be great if it was not so noisy.                
This thing is useless for anyone who cares about pro audio.                
I used this product to convert audio from a DVD player to MP3 on my computer. Unfortunately, when I played it back from the conputer, the audio was distorted and unusable for my video project. I haven't given up on this project, but will need more time to add input pads or whatever is needed to get clean audio.                
I have a lenovo thinkpad E520 laptop. I bought this product because my laptop does not have a line in input. It suppose to be a headphones/mic dual port, but since it didn't work, i Purchased this product. Luckily it works if I am mixing vinyl records. But for some reason, the SL1 usb won't work concurrently with this USB card...which was my sole purpose of purchasing this item. Still trying to figure out a fix for this.                
My main reason for this purchase was to help someone upgrade their laptop PC from a "mic only" input to a "line level" input. It wasn't until after everything was delivered and plugged in that we realized that this USB plug-In was mainly an extension for whatever you already had as a soundcard and not a replacement. Most tower type PC's with a soundcard have stereo miniature phone plugs for the line inputs and output. It seems that this device was built mainly to replace those connectors with the standard stereo phono line inputs and outputs. The entire device works perfectly and the on-board headphone connector is great, but if you're looking to replace your current soundcard "this won't do it", it just extends all the current properties of whatever soundcard you have, into it's own little box. Which means if you want to record a line level into a PC that only has a mic level input, after reducing your input level to about 1, your recording quality won't sound like you're expecting.                
I WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO CONNECT MY COMPUTER TO A PA SYSTEM, THE BEHRINGER UCA 202 USB INTERFACE SOLVED THE PROBLEM WITHOUT KILLING MY WALLET. THE SOUND IS MUCH CLEANER THAN IT WAS WHEN I USED THE HEADPHONE JACK ON THE COMPUTER. NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS PLUG INTO THE USB PORT AND I HAVE LINE IN AND LINE OUT RCA JACKS.                 
THERE WAS A FREE SOFTWARE PROGRAM WHICH IS ALSO FREE ON THE INTERNET                 
SET UP WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD. INSTRUCTION MANUAL WAS OF LITTLE HELP.                
VERY WELL MADE                
YES IT IS WORTH THE MONEY                
I AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD REPLACE IT IF NEEDED.                
Sounds absolutely clean to me. No buzz.                
No one. That's I wanted.                
Just plug and play. Cannot be more simple. The sound is automatically switch from the sound card to the interface.                
Unbeatable for the price                
I really did not even need the manual, I just connected the uca202 to my usb hub, connected my stereo aux inputs to the 202 outputs, opened up WinAmp double clicked on a song and it worked, I'm baffeled at how it routed through my hub no set up nothing, how does it do that?
I use a laptop and when I get home I just wanted to plug one usb cord into my laptop and have all my "sutff" (keyboard, printer, scanner, external hard drive with all my music I listen to, and now my stero amp via behringer's UCA202.  Reallllly cool.                
Time will tell                
Sounds great for what I need it for.                
Features are exactly what I needed  - nothing more, nothing less.                 
Just plug it in and it works - can't get any easier.                 
Solid.                 
The least expensive USB audio interface that I could find.                 
Being that I didn't needed any support, I can't comment on this.                  
"I needed it".  The 3.5mm jack wore out on my Mac G4.  This product served a perfect solution to the problem.                 
Just wanted to update you guys that are thinking of buying this, it works great so far and It work with Vista 64 bit OS! i just plugged it in and thought oh no, theres an annoying static in the music playback. I may a few adjustments to the latency, restarted my syste and the static is completly gone an dthis sounds just as good as my HIGH DOLLAR Maya Audio card that was a few hundred bucks but is not compatable with vista 64! If your thinkabout buying this an dyou have Vista or Vista 64 BUY IT! It works great!                
There really are no features for this thing, just plug it in and start recording.                
This was very easy to use.                
Behringer was helpful with support and friendly but had not tested this device with Vista or Vista 64.                 
Did what was advertised. It made my dell laptop music sound perfect. Replaced the minimal sound card inside with a great sounding digital to analog converter. Just plug into usb and enjoy the music through your home sound system. Wonderful product,a great buy for triple the price.                
The sound quality is nice as well.  It can be used as its own sound card when plugged into the usb on your computer.                  
It has two rca out/in jacks for recording or playing and a headphone jack.  It also has an optical out cable as well.  It has a lot of software that comes with it, however I had to download it all from the Behringer site.                
It is very strait forward to use.  Simply plug it in and once your computer installs it. you will be ready to go.  Be sure you go into the sound settings to make sure it is checked so you can hear sound from it.                
It seems built well.                
I don't know of any other products that I can compare it to.  You get a lot of bang for the buck with this product.                
The website is fairly easy to navigate to download the software.                
It is small so it does not take up much room.                
This thing is small but packs plenty.  I bought it to go along with my xenyx 1202fx and it works great with it.                  
I purchased this soon after getting the xenyx 1202fx. I wanted something inexpensive to record with. What i found was the uca222. It is very inexpensive and makes it very easy to record to my computer. I know most of the time you get what you pay for but this little piece of hardware is worth every penny and then some. I use windows 7 and this thing works great with it. It is pretty strait forward. It is also easy to hook up other speakers with rca cables. Very easy to use at a very affordable price.                 
Does everything promised with the ease of USB. It does want to tweak an audio hardware setting (something to look out for) easily reset to CU default and device will still function perfectly.                
Pure ear candy. I set it up with Guitar Rig 4, very cool. I downloaded like a million presets. The sound you get depends more on the software you use. With guitar rig, the sound is excellent, almost professional. If you can get your hands on good software, you got it made.                 
It now works in XP, Vista, Windows 7. It's only the interface. The drivers are great, but the software is not.                
The driver setup walks you through.                
It's plastic. Just baby it a little.                
Cheaper than any other usb interface for guitar.                
Never tried, but I heard things.                
It's a dorky peace of plastic.                
It sure beats plugging into a computer sound card. For guitar, USB connections rule. It works fine, it's just an interface, cheap, and I'd buy it again.                
The combo amps  give you multiple hoices for sound, you get one of the 3 for free, buy the others for $15 each but beware that this is ONLY a one person practice tool                
The accessories, like the included Audacity recording program DO NOT work with this unit, you must use the Behringer ASIO and audcity wil not, is not allowed to accept it                
It either works out of the box or you spend a lot of time trying to figure it out, the so called manual leaves a lot to be desired                
It's ok for the price, plastic like everything else these days and I have a hard time keeping the jack cord plugged in.                
This is probably a good value if ALL you want is the ability to play using your computer instead of an amp  beyond that forget it.                
In a  week of asking for help I got one auto response which was download and read the iaxe owners manual. wrote back three times and am still waiting almost a week later                
Like 
I said if all you want is to practice using your computer as an amp it's fine, that is all it does, if you want to record look elsewhere and expect to spend a grand or more before your done, as well as investing weeks or months or longer just learning how to use everything.                
As a practice tool it's probably great, but as a means for recording your tunes forget it, it doesn't really do that, certainly not the way you would hope for.                
The unit works well on the input side, but I agree with another reviewer, the input level seems a little low.  On the output side, it works OK with headphones, but emits a high pitched tone in the background when plugged into speakers for monitoring without headphones.  Thankfully, the recorded sound is fine.                
Pretty bare bones.  Comes with 3 "Guitar Combos" based on Native Instruments Guitar Rig, but you can only select one to keep.  Also, contrary to the documentation you cannot use the Guitar Combo as a VST plug-in to another audio application like the free Audicity tool that is supplied.   The software also does not let you route the output to your soundcard/computer speakers.  You have to physically connect the headphone output which leads to the high pitched tone problem I metioned in the sound rating I gave it.                
This is fairly easy to use, however the Windows drivers are difficut to uninstall (it makes you physically disconnect ALL of your USB devices then reboot your computer).                
The unit itself seems to be made well.                
Its the least expensive one out there.  You get what you pay for.                
The jury's still out.  I have a request in about the high-pitched tone I get while running it into computer speakers.  We'll see if they respond.                
Eh.                
I'm already searching for another product, though I haven't yet given up on this.                
I foolishly bought two of these things, and both products arrived in factory-sealed boxes WITHOUT any CD enclosed (i.e, no drivers, no audio software, no amp modeling, no nothing)!. Unbelievable! It states right in the USer Manual that the product comes with software on enclosed CD and it shows a software CD right on the external packaging. Are these people kidding? I wouldn't buy another Behringer product if they PAID me to use it! They're nothing but absolute amateurs!                
The interface didn't work at all for me, the native instruments would have been great if it was possible to activate the program. N. I. website activation nightmare!!! Beware! I found the UCG102 a pointless endeavor as the quality did not exist and the unit had no long lasting type of design to it more like the box your burger came in.                
The software is impossible to load on to a computer so I can't really tell you whether or not the product works.  I emailed Behringer for some support but have yet to hear from them.  If I figure it out, maybe I'll change the review.                
The sound of this product is terrible, there is alot of altering required to avoid getting a high pitched noise over everything else.
And even then the amp models arent great.                
The product doesnt do what it says it does, you cannot use the amp models to record through audacity. I have spent weeks trying to fix all the problems.                
Dont bother                
You get what you pay for                
The product is pointless                
I havent tried to contact them                
I was not satisfied with the product and would not recommend it to anyone.                
The sound is quite good for the price...I usually use it with a wah pedal, but tried it without other preamps and sounded just fine...I use it for recording with guitar rig 4 and it works just fine...                
guitar combos are sort of a demo for guitar rig, so you might want to get the hole soft...I did not use the rest of the package, but it includes also audicity.
Has a jack slot for headphones/speakers, and frankly I've never had to push the headphones volum more than 1/3-2/3, so the preamplification is quite good.
A level switch for boosting the signal can be very useful.
I plug in the headphones slot my speakers, and I still can hear my laptop's speakers so, they CAN work at the same time.                
I don;t know about other users but, in my case, I simply plugged it in and it was ready to go...the product's driver is on the cd, but you might want to upgrade it or so from the behringer site or if you want to use other software than the combos you may want to install the asio4all driver, which you can simply google...                
Plastic, don't be rough.
At this price you would not expect otherwise                
It is the best item at this price, you will not get better quality sound from any other interfaces at this price, and the only one that's better and near this price would be a line6 pod ux2, in which you have to invest a lot.                
Never had to use it, but they gave me a 24 month warranty                
sounds comes in, only with line levels though. if you try to run a mic through it you'll have to boost the heck out of the signal                
came with crappy software. crappy drivers.  nearly crashed my computer.  downloaded necassary stuff online, got it working, but corrupted other stuff on my computer that normally works fine. crap.                
i went to school for this stuff and it took me three days to get a signal.                
cheap plastic. gets lost easily, probably broken easy too. mines not broken yet, but then again, the hammer's still in the drawer                
don't buy it.  I've never returned anything to a music store, but i think i just might return this one. like i said, corrupted my computer, and eventually the unit stopped working all together.  i've burned a lot of money on crappy items in my day, but this one takes the cake in my opinion.                 
didn't even bother.  I deemed it crap and all the live support in the world wouldn't change that                
it could easier be mistaken for an hairless albino mouse.. save the time and get a real mouse that eats and stuff                
overall like i said, i went to school for this stuff. i can build and run a studio from the ground up, and if you're panning on buying this unit, you might as well take two twenties and set them on fire. peace                
I bought this unit to record my tapes and vinyl records to mp3. I connected my turntable and my tape player thru a stereo AB switch, plugged my headphones into the interface, used Audacity to record, and with the proper settings in Win 7 and Audacity I was in business. I couldn't be happier with the results. The recording is clear as a bell. Behringer did good!                
I use this with Music Studio app on iPad... (must have camera connection kit, too) It works well but even when used on a PC w/Audacity I find amplification of the signal BEFORE you process will give higher output levels - (no loss of volume on playback as compared to standard mp3) - 
Does exactly what I hoped it would do - convert old DAT tapes to digital files.  Could not be easier to use.  Great price!                
Ordered Fri. PM from zZounds; arrived Tues. AM over holiday weekend for $2.99 shipping.  Can't beat that!  This is a great hardware product.  But unless you are extremely knowledgeable, you may have software problems.  zZounds should include a note with this product, that if you plan to use Audacity, download the latest version, do not use the version on the supplied disc.  The note also should say, "For Windows Audacity users: IMPORTANT!  See the FAQ 'How can I record in stereo?' on the Audacity web site."  I wasted a lot of time getting Audacity to do 2-channel stereo because I was getting only mono and could not tell whether I had a hardware or software problem.                
the UFO202 works as described except for some time/latency "hiccups" that happen the longer I i use it in session. besides that ... it does what it's supposed to do.                
I am very happy with this purchase.                
this mic is built cheap and eat batteris like crazy spend your money one time not twice like me                
For the price, the UM2 is amazing. The knobs on the top are only for volumes, which is not shown, sadly). Either way, totally worth it, sounds great, and works as advertised                
For a small little 2i2 interface its well worth it. i bought one for traveling and collaborating with others and it spot on. a wittle bright and higher frequesncies and on mac i had to create a special auto routing for it on my mac but its spot on behringer made me mad becaue it was not easy to get the Traction & DAW -took months, they never sent a code and i hade to go to customer service which took some time... .                
Ive been playing guitar for thirty years and this pedal screams 80's Metal, Ratt, Vinnie Vincent Invasion, Dokken and countless others. Over the years ive owned about every distortion pedal on the market and this  $25 dollar pedal is as good as any, sound wise. Plastic it is but Metal it screams don't be afraid take a ride into the unknown and release the inner Metal God inside you. It will be the ride of your life!                
I use this in conjunction with a tube overdrive and an old Marshall Govnor. I achieve three levels of drive this way. First is the Tube Overdrive for some overdriven tube amp sounds. Next is the Govnor for classic Marshall sounds and then comes this pedal. I have it set up to sound like a Triple Rectifier on steroids for when I want to get my amp into massive preamp tube breakup and I use it to get classic Van Halen, Santana,  and other heavy sounds. I works great and I never had to do much tweaking to get the sound I want but this pedal is very versatile and playing around with all the knobs can take you from heavy distortion to metal sustained heaven. I highly recommend it.                 
The sounds are incredible, it leaves off where the super metal and the heavy metal are. It has both the mid and high controls with an added mid frequency control that allows you to cut through the mix or make it heavier. The distortion is heavy, in fact so heavy i only put at about   2 o'clock.                
With all the eq it has, its got the best features in Behringer's distortion range  and at this price its hard to beat.                
Its easy to use but it takes a little bit of tweaking to find your favorite sound(What pedal doens't take tweaking anyways?)                
It is sturdy as long as you don't stomp on it super hard but why would you do that anyways. It has lasted me a couple gigs now and its still good.                
Best for this price and more.                
Only had to talk with them once (for a Behringer multi fx-600) and they quickly switched it out for a new working pedal.                
It adds color to my board so its pretty nice.                
I expect to be satisfied with it until behringer comes out with another better distortion pedal.                
This pedal has so much bite and balls.... it sounds just like its 90 dollar competitors... and its 25 BUCKS! True, it's plastic... but for me that's fine since I'm just a bedroom strummer with a practice amp which doesn't give me a metal overdrive... but this pedal is all you need if metal is your goal.                 
i really like it, its the same as the Boss metal zone for way less and it has less his then the boss metal zone!                
it had nothing that came with it, just the pedal!                
really easy if you know the osund you want.                
i have had the ultra metal for about a month and still works, i do worry about the fact that its like 98% plastic!                
for $25 its amazing and the his is lesser then the metal zone                
i have had no issues                
could use like a better name like demon distortion!                
i will keep this as long as it last!                
i woulnt know because i coulnt get it to work! i even called my guitar lesson-place because this was my first one, and i did everything right, and it still didnt work!                
it included nothing except a tiny little panflet of directions (rubbish) and nothing else, not even a battery!                
the directions were a bit of rubbish, it took me about a day to find the battery slot, and it doesnt tell you were it is! this was my first distortion pedal and it SUCKED                 
no, its plastic, i mean, not really quality material                
piece of crap for 30 bucks                
i havent used it                
piece o' crap                
Being very new to recording, I was hesitant to spend a lot of money on an interface only to find out that recording was too complex or too time consuming for me. I am 59 and a lifelong guitar player that wanted to capture some of my playing digitally before I get too much older and don't have the dexterity that I now have.
I use GarageBand  and must say that this has truly been a plug-n-play device for me. GB immediately found the UMC202HD device upon starting the app and assigned it automatically as my input/output device. So all I had to do then was set the I/O levels and I was off and running laying down a new track for a song.
I was amazed at how much better my virtual guitar amps sounded with this device. I haven't tried a microphone yet, but I expect that it will be just as pleasant an experience. The pad switch on the inputs is a very nice touch which I immediately found handy. This device seems to be very quiet as well. I would encourage anyone who is on a budget or like me and didn't want to spend a lot of money on an interface only to find out that recording is too time consuming or they don't enjoy it, to buy this interface. If you are planning to spend $100 -$125 on a new 2 channel interface, I strongly recommend that you buy this one  instead as you will not be disappointed. With zZounds excellent returns policy, you have nothing to lose by trying it. I can't speak for the longevity of this device yet,  but at $59, even if it bites the dust in 2 years, I would gladly purchase the same model again or possibly upgrade to a Behringer with more I/O channels if needed. I was using a 2 year old USB Cable/Interface that I paid $40 for because I did not want to spend $150 at the time to find out that recording was not for me. Needless to say, that cable interface  worked just well enough that I figured out how to use GB, but latency was an issue that would occur frequently and I would have to restart GB.  Now I am wowed by the difference in sound quality and have not observed any latency when recording guitar and bass.
I too have not received my Tracktion software key via email even though I registered successfully. I downloaded all of the free Mac plug-ins on the Behringer site but I have been unable to find them in Garageband even after several reboots of the app. I have not contacted support yet, but may do so in a few days. Right now, I am just having fun with what I have.                
Surprisingly good! It seems that Behringer learned something from buying Midas. I get a clean, consistent 48v signal and very little if any noise. The pots are quiet and overall does a great job!                
It comes with the standard feature set that you find with most two channel interfaces, but it does them well.                
*Almost* plug and play. I say almost because no matter what I do, my production office copy of ProTools 11 Still won't play ball with it. But Sonar X3, Reaper, Ableton Live and Studio One all have no problems whatsoever. And, it makes for a great podcasting/Google Hangout interface too! This really is a great little box for someone who wants to start recording on their own to get into things. This with a $60 license of Reaper can get ANYONE recording! I would of killed for a cheap and easy option like this 10 years ago                
I have only had it for a little over 8 months, but surprisingly good! Dunno if I want to count my chickens before they hatch (because it is still Behringer), but I have been pleasantly surprised                
While there are some others that play in this category, I refuse to acknowledge PreSonus. That makes Behringer one of the best buys I've found under $100                
Haven't had to use it yet... in the past they were as bad as PreSonus, but these days, they may be improving. But, no need to use them yet                
While it looks cooler than the other boxes, it is still just a box. The Wow factor comes from the fact that it's actually made by Behringer... and it's actually GOOD! If they keep doing stuff like this, I may buy much more from them                
I got this as a "fluff" item to fill out one of zZounds financing requirements to get an order to a certain total. I didn't expect much given my previous experience with Behringer. But, I do have to say I am pleasantly surprised! Feels surprisingly good in quality (better than PreSonus... which isn't hard... and even better than Focusrite). But, no one cares how an interface feels or looks, just sounds. And... this one does the job well! Totally USB powered and easy to use, with no extras you don't need. Even the knobs and switches feel pretty solid. The *only* thing I would change is to put the phantom power switch on the front, but that is a small complaint.                
I just got this like three days ago I looked at it was like no way this little thing going out preform my m- audio interface then I compared it to the Steinberg ur22. This little monster can do it all. Plus with a db pad cut button and direct monitoring button. Not to even mention the clear crisp direct sound this little monster puts out. And I tested in fl studio,Reason,sonar,cubase, and the mpc software. It's legit I would recommend this little monster to any one. And I'm willing to stand by it. I been producing and engineering 13yrs. Using outboard and other things. O yea and sampling threw it with my phone.                
I'm not new to USB interfaces, but a bit baffled why it's taking so long to get my download code for Traction software. It requires an upload of receipt (which is weird because I ASSUME it means the one from zZounds???) but upon submitting the registration, it says you will receive email, NO EMAIL and tech support is EMAIL ONLY - which translated means I'm likely to receive a bunch of emails with links to the directions that aren't specfic and all say 'you will receive email.' So - at first unboxing I'm not happy with the support of this product. Box itself 'seems' durable, but boy would be nice to use it! I'll update IF I get it working.                
From recording vocal, and guitar stems. Tracking drums. Live monitoring with no latency (assuming you adjust your driver settings) and plugins. It has made countless songs for me already, and I have had no issues. Built like a tank. Would highly recommend UMC style interfaces to any musician seeking the realm of DAW, and plugins.                
For me I have had Zero issues with this audio interface, sounds great too.  almost plug n play, drivers are obviously needed.                
A great 4 channel USB interface for the price. The pre-amps are exceptionally quiet. The perfect unit for my home studio. I had to download the latest driver from Behringer in order to get my DAW to recognize the UMC404HD, but no problems after that.                
Worked flawlessly out of the box after driver installation, but it went downhill from there. Driver has flaked on me since. After installing newest driver I can use it in Reaper again, but output only from left channel. Have reached out to customer support, but haven't heard back as of yet. I feel like I've spent more time trouble shooting this interface than recording with it so far. Records decently when it has worked. If I can ever get it working properly again and without issue it will have been money well spent despite the issues. If I can't get it working properly soon I will try a Focusrite interface.                
This is completely not compatible with Windows 7. Behringer has LIED in their videos, and they made made several versions to please the FCC. Other versions of Windows have a little more luck. But this is made for MAC. They are dfumping it at 99 bucks. And have had several lawsuits settled out of court already. Stay away from this if you have any WINDOWS OS                
I am basing my 10 rating strictly on the keyboard itself and not the software that's included.
The overall design of this controller is brilliant..very solid,compact and simple,but with very smooth controls and fantastic full size keys with semi-weighted action....I am really surprised and amazed by this keyboard!!                
The EnergyXT DAW that came with this keyboard is virtually useless without the upgrade.
The upgrade was a nightmare,as the upgrade is NOT available for download directly from their website!
You pay for the license first,and then you wait for someone from the company to send it to you via e-mail(whenever they feel like getting around to it).
I waited a week for them to send me the upgrade and when I received it,I spent another week trying to install it and it never worked(I have Windows 7).
I finally got my refund,but I'll never deal with EnergyXT again.The DAW's simplicity is nice,but since it is such an unstable program,it's a sick joke....my advice; stay far away from EnergyXT & save your money for a program that is known to work.                
The build quality is the best I've ever seen for the money.                
The keyboard itself is the best value out there.                
Behringer is EnergyXT's distributor,so you'll have to deal with EnergyXT directly....they are helpful,but very slow.                
Its just a midi controller                
no pads, but it has plenty of knobs!                
Its pretty much plug and play, at least on macs.                 
The only real con here is the pitch bend is kindof loud, and the keys make some noise, but the feel is fine and has plenty of resistance.                 
Worth it. 19                
Its bright metallic  red !  Would easily match a nord lead.                
this is a midi controller, so it doesn't have sounds.                
it hasn't worked for me, despite hours of trying with online searches, manuals, forums etc..                
does not sync smoothly to mac.. doesn't connect to midi sound module at all.. very difficult to get any information from their website.  It is mind blowing that the company offers no instructions in their manuals at all..especially for a keyboard with the unusual aspect of not having a  display window...you would think that they would explain various operations in detail since it limited in visual feedback                
ok, i give this a 3 because when i unpacked it, it felt pretty solid..heavier than i imagined..the knobs etc seem pretty tough..BUT..
one of the keys ( A note in middle of keyboard)only works if you push realllllly hard..making the device virtually useless..I will be returning it asap                
the price is cheaper than everyone else, and the product is unusable..what a bargain.                
ok, behringer takes the cake for giving you the run around..no phone numbers..only endless, poorly designed 'support' areas..this aspect may have been the most frustrating of all..even more than the keyboard arriving broken..easily the worst experience I've ever had with a musical instrument company.                
it's red.                
i will return it immediately, and unless I can get any answers from support, I will just get my money back and buy an m-audio controller                
No sound as its a midi keyboard                
Well built for the price                
Works perfect with iPad 2 garageband an with provided software without any problems                
Looks great well built for the price                
Great price for what you get                
None needed                
Works perfect with iPad 2 without any extra power                
A long time                
This thing is awful!! Not only does it simply not work on all 6 strings, but the tone it generates oscillates back and forth if you let the note sound long enough but eventually it will do it anyway. On the highest string you have to nearly break it to get it to make a sound and even then its a weird modulated sound that only lasts for about a second.                
You pretty much have 3 volume knobs and a hi-med-low switch that, to me, does nothing and no way to raise the pitch and octave.                
Not too hard. Getting the battery in is lame. You have to take the pedal cover off. Maybe that's how it is with all of them. I don't know. It's still lame. An old fashion battery door should do.                
Looks like a great pedal. Pretty solid. Doesn't look particularly cheap.                
Seriously I just got this pedal in the mail today after waiting what felt like forever to get it and it turned out to be just awful! I was so excited to get one after having used an octave pedal with my guitar instructor (his was a different brand). I'm returning this one and getting his brand.                
I purchased this pedal as an inexpensive solution to the tremolo found on some of the Fender amps. I was looking at the Tremolo / Pan / Stereo pedal but ordered this one instead. I was hesitant after reading some reviews online that complained of volume drop.I have not experienced any of the volume drop and overall I am satisfied with this tremolo. I could have spent lots more money to get the same effect but this is an effect that is used sparingly. I find it comparable to the other effects I looked at for a lot less cash.                
Not perfect but for the excellent. It does have a slight volume drop if you use to much depth but it is more of a dark sound. I set the depth about two o'clock and it is perfect. All of the classic fender and vox sounds plus everything in between. Great surf, blues, and R&B or what ever. Very quiet and transparent if you don't max out the depth control.                
After buying two other Behringer Pedals which work just fine, I decided to try a Vibrato Pedal primarily because it was rather fun purchasing a stomp box for only $25 bucks.
The UV300 Vibrato Pedal has become one of my primary pedals.  I play at lot of "clean chordal comping jazz stuff" and the pedal gives the chords a rather "vibraphone quality" which is quite beautiful when combined with a little reverb.
.
One of the things to understand is;  The UV300 is NOT a Tremolo Pedal.  It provides Frequency Modulation to the guitar much as a whammy bar does.  That's what it's supposed to do and the pedal does it quite nicely.  Vibrato is Modulated Frequency.  Tremolo is Modulated Amplitude.  Don't confuse the two.  If you're looking for that "Bo Diddley Tremolo Sound" get a Tremolo Pedal.
The pedal is also capable of provided more "radical modulations" to the guitar but as I'm just a humble Jazz Guitar Student playing clean most of the time I'm no subject matter expert on what to do with the more extreme settings. 
Overall, the UV300 is a keeper and a fun device.
This works really well for the price. It's understandable that it came in plastic instead of an aluminum case. I would recommend for at home or for jam sessions, but not to sure for a live set...                
Terrible.  The thing sounds more like a BAD chorus pedal.  I bought it for the "classic" vibrato effect.  It is nothing like the classic 60's, 70's vibrato effects.  The "RISE" control doesn't seem to do much.  And of course for ture "classic" vibrato, you wouldn't want any modulation.  So that is a real problem.                
Behringer is trying to give us the extra option to introduce more or less modulation to give more of a chorus sound, but the "RISE" control didn't seem to do much.  And it really sounded terrible no matter how I set the controls.  I wouldn't clasify the sound as vibrato nor chorus.  Just a trashy cheap sound.                
They tried.                
It was defective.  There was an audible electronic clicking no matter if the pedal was active or inactive.                
No matter what the price, it has to work!                
Don't know                
I wouldn't even use this if I were at the gig and had nothing else to use.  I would just set it aside and play the guitar flat!  That's how bad it is.                
I more than satisfied with the sound.  Distortion, sustain, echo, reverb are very good to excellent.                
Takes a while to get used to.  Download the free editing Window software from Behringer web site, and get a low cost USB to MIDI converter cable to get to really tweaking your sound.                
The power connection is something I fear is going to fail.  You have to plug and unplug it, there is no on/off switch.                
You can't beat this for the price.  About $108 street price.  Get one.                
The web site has manuals, and free editing software.                
I like the various tones that I can achieve without spending a fortune on 'stomp' boxes.  Even the 'touch' wah is very effectivie.                
I would replace it if it was lost, stolen, or broken.                
This thing is the best, it records with the software and sounds killer, perfect size. Its way better than the old models  and for the money. The Germans score again.                
I have had mine for around two years now, and I've used it for many live shows. I like to run mine through tube, or hybrid tube amps using only slight distortion and effects. This pushes the pre amp tubes really nicely in my amps and I can get all kinds great tones. It sounds really good through the clean channel of a solid state amp to. You can use the two out puts to run to two different amps as well, which gives you really interesting tones. This is good to, if all you have is two smaller amps and need to be louder,  just use them at the same time. It has been dropped, thrown in gig bags, and accidentally spray painted and is still going strong.                
I love this piece of equipment. Its easy to dial in a good tone, and sounds huge through headphones. My Ibanez, a friends Strat and an ESP Les Paul copy all sounded great, with a nice tube-like sag and sparkle and loads of sustain on tap.Simple to jam along to songs using the aux jack. Great investment in your playing                
I have been using this unit for the past month. It has been a good replacement to my previous guitar controler. The amp emulations and drive options give me more control and flexibility with the sounds I get from my guitar. I was impressed because I played with another guitar player who used a Twin Reverb. I liked the sound so I played with the emulation and was pleased with the sound and also that the gain gave me very subtle variations in the amount of distortion based on the level of the guitar. There is less flexibility with effects because you are limited to one selection per memory location. The effects are either one or a combination of two effects with three variations the can be adjusted to the saved memory location. 
     I think this is a very good value for the cost but I am continuing to look at other options. It does not use a standard 9 volt power supply but it does with with other pedals I have.                
Just bought this to get cool guitar and bass sounds to record using my Tascam DP-01......So far it seems cool,but I will need time to play with it(I will do that while I am on a glorious 10 day vacation)                
So far,so good....I will need time to tweak it                
Got this bad boy for 26 dollars less than Musician's Friend.....I am done with them and my local Guitarcenter......(They tried to screw me on a Marshall JCM 800 that I wanted to trade for some equipment)                
It is a cool metallic red.....bad to the bone                
THIS LITTLE RED BAG OF TRICKS GIVES ME BETTER TONE Than my ELEVEN RACK !!! And COST ME 100's of Dollars LESS!

A compact and light pedal comparable to the sound of much expensive boutique pedals. 
If you're on a tight budget but looking for high quality sounding analog delay, VD400 would be the best solution.                
Just like any other vintage analog delay pedal, the three control knobs are easy to use and tweak to get the sound you are looking for in an analog delay pedal.                
Its made of plastic, but industrial grade ABS plastic; the same material used on motorcyle helmets, and other impact resistant headgears/safety gears.                
With the price, this pedal is a winner among the analog delay pedals.                
No problem so far.                
Its the sound. Did a test with the Aqua Puss, and couldnt tell the difference when i closed my eyes.                
Works perfectly and sounds great. For 25 bucks I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I typically dont buy " cheap" products but youtube videos on just about all the Behringer pedals sound fantastic. Took a chance on it and glad I did. Gives me that slapjack echo delay I needed to tune in that Johhny Cash/Luther Perkins tone.                 
I've only had this about a month or so, but I like it!! For the money, this thing works like a charm, does exactly what it's supposed to do, nice little slapback-type delay, and gives a nice full sound. I'm sure it could be tweaked to do more, but I was quickly able to zero in on the sound i needed. I use this mainly for harmonica, but it works just as well for guitar. There doesn't seem to be any volume loss when the pedal is turned on. I like the two separate outputs for effect signal and dry signal (two amps is always fun)
Yes it's plastic, but good, thick, sturdy-feeling plastic. I don't foresee that being an issue- simple as not being abusing the gear. 
I'm sure spending the extra $100 or more will give a lot more tricks and variety. I was a little nervous since the price is so low, and these days it's hard to find quality for this price range. So for us musicians who have to make every dollar spent really count, this is great!!
If you looking for a delay and cant seem to find one cheap here it is. from Atmospheric to Rock-a-billy this does it.                 
Got mine today. For 25 dollars I'm very pleased with its performance. Im generally wary of buying " cheap" products but for 25 bucks I took a chance. Bought it to get that Waylon Jennings sound and it delivers. Watched many youtube videos where this cheap pedal performs just as well if not better than the MXR Phase 90. Spent a few hours with it today and very happy. I expected it to be very cheaply built but surprisingly it is made pretty sturdy.                 
Awesome very clear highs and punchy bass love these PA Speakers                
These Shipped Quick Theyre Nice And Sturdy Very Clean The Speakers Boast Exceptional Highs Very Bright! And Good Bass Response We Installed It At My Church With A 1000 Watt Amp (Samson S1000) With More than enought power since these are 150w Program Each And The Amp 500w Each Chanel At 4 Ohms the power drives them wild the sound is impressive i know audio because i engineer! Good Bang For Your Buck!                 
Very good sounding monitor for the price 
I have 8 and have only lost one due to rough handling from falling (magnet shifted)
For the price I couldn't buy the parts to build this for this price                 
The speaker construction could be a bit more robust in the magnet mounting department 
Which makes this monitor more fragile than most  But if you take care they are fine and hold up well                
Pretty simple plug and play not much EQ needed                 
Great box weak magnet mounting to frame
Sound quality great for the price                 
Great deal for a beginning band or sound company on a tight budget this works                 
The support was great to work with but in some kind of transition so a replacement speaker basket took 6 months to arrive But support was good                 
Looks good well made                 
I've got almost a year on my monitors and hope to get at least 1 more out of them before I sell off and update 
For the price I'm very satisfied                 
I have been using Behringer equipment for many years and all have been virtually trouble free.  My bass amp is a Bugera, GMX110 modeling amp, Europower PMP6000 mixer, (2) VP1520 main speakers,(4)  VP1220 monitors, (3) 1800xms mics and (1) 8500 mic,  I also have a Shure Beta 58 mic ($180) and it is no better than my Behringers.  I have also had a Behringer GMX212, GMX210, (3) GMX110 and their 300 watt 15" combo bass amp as well a 6 PA speakers and 12 channel mixer that I lost in a fire.  In all the years I used them (a lot of gigs) I only had to replace the 1/4" input jack on one of the GMX110s.  Admittedly, the tuners were off some, but I used Korg inlines anyway.  I will choose Behringer products over the high priced "top of the line" equipment every time.  First class equipment with a price that a poor country boy like me can afford.                
Highs not that high lows not that low and mids a little muddy, but the price is right. Guess you get what you pay for.                
I have used Behringer speakers before so this was no exception. It's got all you paid for ,Plus. I'd buy them again. I use  my VP1520 PA SPEAKERS with 2 Behringer 18's Subwoofers  and of course my 30 channe; BEHRINGER PMP 6000 and I rock everybody;s world. Lots of POWER.
             .                
Simply awesome on all scores, and in all environments.                
Solid construction, portability, quality materials.                
They're speakers. They work great.                
These are constructed great. I could not ask for better, and certainly not at such a great price.                
This is an awesome deal!!                
I have not called customer service pertaining to these speakers, but I know that zZounds has awesome customer service.                
After much research, I still feel that these are the best choice for the DJ on the go!                
These are great speakers. I do not anticipate and problems with them, ever, due to the units themselves.                
No!                
I play the bass guitar, i sound good!                
It's not hard at all!I never used any other product! Sorry                
Yes!Very Good!I Hope for ever!                
Yes!                
Never!                
Outstanding!No!                
I bought my speakers a year ago OUTSTANDING the sound and clarity is so sharp, you just have to here for yourself, when i do my inside gigs i donot need all 4 of my spearkers just two will do.                
Amazing for the price. Boom Boom gigs out, this sub is perfect for large audience. The sound quality is outstanding. I am thinking to buy another one to send to my country. (Haiti)                
Peefect, everything is OK                
Its like Plug & Play                
Cannot be better than that                
Worth it                
First buy no complaint                
Well made first class material                
No I am stick with Behringer                 
I am by no means a sound specialist, but these subs deliver with the right combination of amps (QSC GX3),frequency crossover, quality speakon cables amd subwoofer. I have tried songs with deep base and explosive sound effects, and long before the amp indicated clipping the walls and ceilings were feeling the deep bass.                 
Ability to daisy chain 2 subs for ultimate punch was sweet.                 
Just plug in to amp and go. Just pay attention to limiters on amp.                
The overall speaker configueration is nice. Two things I would add to make it more to my liking are:
1- Protective rubber covers for edges
2- Make coasters an available accessory. I added 4 with locks and it makes a difference with mobility and keeing the carpet cover higher off ground when there are spills on floors at party.                 
I thing Zzounds made my day with their pricing and shipping cost. I dont have much disposable income and these are worth every penny I spent.                
did not contact                
Just get it, you would not be disappointed.                
I hope to maximize the use of theis product for years to come. I may add another pair of these bad boys to rock larger parties.                
Bought these to replace a set of Harbinger subs. Really liked the Harbingers, but there is NO comparison. These subs have a killer bass response. We play metal/alternative and they are a great addition to our set up. Our sound guy LOVES them. He says the difference in our sound is like night and day.                
They got an 8 on this because all the literature (even the stuff FROM Behringer)says it has Speakon AND 1/4" connectors. Mine has ONLY Speakon connectors. Don't know if it's a mis-print, or mine are oddballs. Either way, I bo 1/4 adapters and all is good.                
Uuuuhhhhhh.....pretty straight-forward...1 in 1 out.....                
Very well made. SOLID as a truck. And MAN are these things heavy. Like around 100-125 lbs. each. But all that weight makes for a GREAT tone!!!                
You will NOT find a better sounding sub for this price. Listened to several all the way up to twice the price of these and they didn't come CLOSE to sounding as good as these.                
I own several Behringer products and have never had a problem with any of them. So I can't comment as to support. I've never had to use it once in the past 10 years.                
Really like the sound ports in the bottom of the face under the speaker.                
Plan on getting a lot of shows out of these. If they were lost or stolen. I would replace them with the exact same thing.                
first off i dont give 10's  because nothing is perfect...  these do sound good.  I have been running them in a live band setting and they are holding up well.  Driving them with 3000 watt rms  amp  2 pair,,   they are  short throw 18's  and i have a pair of long throw  so i have the best of both worlds.  Compact units, Need to add wheels for easy of setup,,  i have experienced better tighter low end when these subs are crossed at or below  125 hz.   overall  very good quality and price  and  by the why the rms on these is only 400rms  so make sure you are running them with clean power of at least 550 rms                 
none                
I bought 2 of these to use in a bar venue where we do live music and karaoke and these are wonderful. Nice low tone and plenty of thump. I have two of them running on a crown xls2000 mono bridged crossed at 118hz. and they sound great. Only have speakon connections so make sure you have the right cables or adapters.
We may get Two more for another venue we work at. I would recommend these to anyone looking for some inexpensive subs.                
I ordered a pair as back ups. Sounds incredible right out of the box (to my amp of course). This pair did the job on the low end for a 150+ gig. Nice and compact but my only thing is its black carpet not vinyl coated. On the other hand, Shipping was great because I got my shipment a day early which was a BIG +. If your on a budget start out with these bad boys.                 
This passive sub is excellent! Has the deep smooth punch I was looking for. The price was perfect and its a nice piece of equipment sturdy, well built pushes the bass across a room!                
Once again zZounds comes through with the fastest shipping, the best products, and quality service !!                
So far I am very pleased with these subs. A little heavier than expected but well worth the price!                
At higher volume the speaker makes a cracking sound,  so our church has decided to continue to use it,   just making sure the volume level is kept to a more normal level where it sounds okay.                
Overall it seems to be a reasonably performing subwoofer,  at low to moderate volume levels.                
Sounds are just fine as long as the volume level is low to moderate.                
Product has major flaw in that all the weight of the speaker bears down on the lower under structure members,  underneath the speaker.   These wooden members are actually not wood but rather weak particle board and therefore subject to cracking and coming loose,  which is exactly what happened to this unit -- cracked and also disconnected at many joints.                
Yes.                
No I have not dealt with the manufacturer.                
Appeal is good,  but only because it looks powerful,  when in actuality it cannot perform to a high level of output due to cracked speaker and cabinet.                
Product was advertised with cosmetic blemish, at a reduced price.  The listing did not include a specific description or photograph of the cosmetic blemish.  When the product was received I noticed significant structural damage at the base of the subwoofer cabinet,  just as the reviews stated often happens with this model.  zZounds stated they would not offer any refund of money, nor file claim with the carrier,  but would only supply a replacement after I shipped the product back to them at my cost,  which would be significant if done properly.                
I just finished building a dual sub woofer box to hold two 18" daytons. My budget wouldn't allow me to purchase those subs at the time, so after some research I discovered these speakers and the payment options, so I took advantage of it. After receiving the speakers I immediately hooked them up one at a time using a nu3000. I immediately noticed the rattling sound. The whole left side of the front buffle wall was vibrating. After investigation, I discovered the box wasn't even MDF. Long story short, the carpet was pretty much holding the box together in both subs. It's been about two weeks worth of glueing and reglueing. I also discovered mold in one of the boxes upon receiving them. On the day of discovering all the issues I contacted customer service, they send a ra number shipping label. I decided not to wait another week on more speakers and to try to fix the problem myself. Because I'm sure I probably would have received another set of low quality speakers. I now have them somewhat together and they sound a whole lot nicer. You get what you pay for. After all my work I'm happy!                
I bought a pair of these to use for smaller rooms.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of sound they produced.  We had another band play our stuff so we could get out and listen all through the room, and they kicked a$$.  I powered these with an IPR 1600 Peavey amp, and had them paired with some Peavey SP2's.  They do sound good.  Only down side was the ad and the manual showed them with both speakon and 1/4 in inputs but the y came with only speakons.  Zzounds sent me a set of cables to rectify the situation.  Great service!                
I purchased a pair of these to replace a set of Peavey SP 118's to reduce the volume in our trailer. I was surprised at the quality of sound these speakers put out. I am powering them with a Peavey IPR 1600 amp. they are paired with a set of SP2's. I tested them with our band playing throough them and another band as well, so I could get a good feel for them throughout the room. Medium size room with around 250 people and coverage was good.Only problem was the ad showed them with both neutrik and 1/4 in inputs, but they only came with neutrik. This was easily remedied when I called Zzounds and they immediatley sent two Neutrik cables.                
I am a mobile DJ and I must say I am totally impressed with how AWESOME and CLEAR these speakers sound, I have always liked the sound of QSC but I bought 4 of these barely pushed them with my Behringer iNuke 6000, all I can say is WOW !!!  (after the cops came to my gig to turn it down !!! ) The dual 15's were so nice and DEEP (Great for R&B, Down South Soul & Hip Hop I played for that client) I didn't need sub-woofer and I am VERY impressed, ordering more soon for the club. For the price and sound, built very solid (NOT cheap particle board) you can NOT go wrong...Period. .I can honestly see why so many TRUE artist love a passive set-up instead of powered/active speakers...Especially hearing your voice coming out, which is superb, bye bye QSC..                
I recently ordered a pair of the VP 2520 to daisy-chain with another pair of columns.  They arrived, I added them to the sound chain and fired them up.  As an addition to my existing speakers, the VP 2520's add a new dimension of crispness clarity, punch, and sonic acuity to the music. Vocals are crisp, clear, and the VP 2520's handle the full range of vocals superbly. Until there's opportunity to play outdoors, there isn't a need for sub woofers.  Between the existing columns and the new VP 2520's, there's more than enough bass and bottom end to satisfy.  I can see adding another pair, and using the existing columns as monitors.  Given they're a 2000 watt speaker, an additional pair would be perfect in terms of the wattage I'm striving for, with the PA System.  At present the system is at approximately 4000 watts.  Yes, these are heavy speakers, and a hand truck is a good thing, but when you're dealing with Marshall 1960 Cabs, it's not that much different.  Quality is as one would expect, flawless.  You can pay a lot, for your speakers and get the same sound quality or you can pay what these cost and get the same sound quality...  I recommend these for any level of musician or band, whether just starting out or having been playing out, awhile.                
First, Zzounds give's musicians an opportunity to own good equipment with different payment plans option I've been a user of behringer products now for more than. 10 years..
The speakers sounds great, the delivery was qick ,and you cant beat. The price! !!                
I have been using a pair of the Behringer VP2520 speaker since 2011. I bought a second pair three years so I only use the old one for outdoor gigs. Now the infor:First the VP2520 are carpeted covered over particle board. It is well constructed and the particle board has held up very well over the past seven years. Though the carpet along the bottom of the speaker will wear out quickly.I use the VP2520 with two Crown XLS1000 power amp operating in the mono bridge mode. In the bridge mode Crown rates these amps at 1100 watt RMS. I never run the amps into clipping. Most of the time only the first two LEDs on the meters are lit when I am playing music. Even when used when I DJ high school proms this amp/speaker configuration easily provides sound for 500 plus students. Plus note I do not use the VP2520 below 100HZ. I use to JBL dual 18s operating at 4KW to 6KW. By removing the low end from the VP2520 they perform better. Additionally I use a DBX Drive Rack speaker management system. This help makes the VP2520 sound even better.Issues: Over the years I have had the following issues with my first two VP2520:1. The carpet tears easily. Always keep Elmers glue handy to make quick permanent repairs.2. An internal brace came a loose. It wasn't broken so I was able to fix this issue. See #3. 3. One of the port tubes fell into the speaker twice. The second time I repaired this I took off the grill and removed both woofers. I also found and fixed the internal brace that had come a loose.4. The rubber feet need replacing. The original feet were held in place with one wood screw. I replaced the screw with a bolt, two washers, and a nut. You will have to remove the grille and bottom woofer to complete this task.These were the only issue to come up during the seven years I have been using the VP2520 in my mobile DJ service. I use these speakers every weekend.Simple put, the VP2520 is an outstanding value (at least the way that I use them).I have use the VP2520 along side my JBL SRX tops and the VP2520 did very well.Technical detail: System A: two VP 2520 powered by two Crown XLS1000 BridgedSystem B: two JBL SRX725 powered by one QSC RMX4000.From the listeners stand point there was not difference in the sound. The SRX725s were able to play the same sequence of music 3 dbs louder than the VP2520s. Is 3dbs worth triple the cost? Probably not.                
The product performs very well. I have karaoke business and the speskers provide very good sound both audio and voice.                
utilize speakon connections for connection.                
plug and play.                
Quality is excellent                
The product is well worth the price paid.                
Haven't had to use support for this item.                
Will continue to use product indefinitly. Would replace with like item. Have had nothing but good experiences with Behringer Products.                
Love big but not too big I'm mobile so that is key but quality is everything love these                
Great sub, I use it for guitar and Behringer electric drums.  Also hook my phone and or laptop to it and a Behringer B110D (also great PA speaker).  It sounded OK running my laptop directly to it by means of a 3.5 to XLR cable.  But once I got the Behringer xenyx 502 mixer, it made a big difference.  Before I  had early clipping and had to have my speaker and sub volume almost all the way up to get anything close to loud.  But after the mixer, loud and clear and very powerful!                
I have two of these. I also have two JBL JRX15 on top. These VQ1500D work very well to create a good balance of mid low and highs. If you are looking for something with some real punch I would recommend finding something larger with more power. Overall for the money these subs are well worth the money. They are built well and sound amazing in a small venue.  They tend to clip even when the level is in the mid to lower ranges.                 
I've owned a pair of Behringer B215d speakers for 18 months, and they've held up well, even though as a resident club DJ, I gig with them three nights a week. They still sound great. 
So I already had a good impression of Behringer. I believe they offer lower priced products that are definitely competitive with the higher priced brands.  So recently when I decided to purchase a new sub to add some extra bass to my existing rig, I really didn't consider any other brand. 
I bought the Behringer VQ1500D, and I'm very glad I did.  I can't believe that a sub priced this low offers such great sound! The bass is thumping, and with the Bass Boost function, you can push em even harder. I'm telling you, get one or two of these for your rig you won't regret it!                
so i dj at a bar and needed some bottom end bass i gone with this sub due to i have a set of the vp2520's what i like it the speaker is small and only 400$ and is self power and bass dose sound clean but what i dont like is you turn the level knob just a little bit and the clip light is on so i wish it could have some more of a kick to it but for the price its not bad for a small bar or wedding even a school dance it would work but for mid + size club i would go with something else                 
The behringer VQ1800D Active Subwoofer has an amazing low responce, that's the reason why i purchase another one to match my first purchase, i like it very much and it's very easey to set up. thank you so much zzound and their staff for shipping my order ontime.now i'm using it to my dj sound service and our audiences at the party's are very please with its sound quality.Thanks, jed r.                
I purchased the Behringer VQ 1800 for medium sized wedding venues in which I provide my DJ services. I used it this past weekend in a 3200 sq foot wedding hall with 20 foot ceilings. The Behringer performed very well paired with my 4 powered 12 inch speakers, and reached the dance floor (20 feet from my set up) with punch and full sound. So far, I am more than pleased with this subwoofer.                
Well this subwoofer really does the job, off course there can be another options but for the price range  the quality is just amazing I used it for church or other presentations and it just really surprise me, I play piano and when it comes to combine the bass player drumms and keyboards it works perfectly very clear!!! The only thing that can be better is the cable is to short at least for me.                
Not as loud as I thought it would be however it gives a serious 'thump' to our band's kick drum and bass. We're a working blues band and wanted to add some more bottom end and this sub works just right for us. We're not an overly loud band to begin with, so this gives us some more depth. This will work good in the small dives we play, and when we play big venues and festivals they have their own sound, so this is just right for us.                
The metal grill seems like it should protect the speaker well, and since the Fed-Ex man threw it off the truck onto my driveway, I guess the metal grill works just fine. Not much else to it, a few knobs, a plug and a switch. Simple as can be.                
Plug and play. We are just using this to give more thump to our bass and drums, and not even going through our main mixer for it. Simple as can be. Mic the bass amp and kick drum directly to the unit. Works just right for us.                
Some folks deride Behringer stuff, but I have never had any problems with any Behringer products ever. Bass amps, power amps, mixers, speakers, for many years and never had a problem. All my Behringer stuff always works, never let me down, and even if this unit fried, I would still buy Behringer stuff, based on all the gear I have from them which has been flawless.                
I purchased a scratch and dent unit, and other than the above mentioned issues, it was a great deal on a good product. I'd buy another.                
Never had to call or work with the company, never had an issue with any of their products.                
It's a sub woofer...wow... :-)                
Purchased a scratch and dent. It arrived in a box that looked like it was dropped from a plane, every piece of foam padding broken in little pieces, and the bottom foot broken off and stripped from the screw hole. Manual missing too. However, it was advertised as scratch and dent so with a little wood glue, and a toothpick fixed the broken foot issue. Can't complain based on the discount I received, coupled with 10 minutes of repair work. The unit itself looks and works perfectly.                
Very good speaker for the money.I am selling mine because it was to heavy for a 63 yr old man to be transporting around.But you cannot go wrong with this product.Great strong bass sound coming out of it and when you hook up the other 2 speakers to it, you get a nice rich sound coming out                
Wow factor !!!I added one subwoofer to my DJ system and the lows were very impressive, so impressive, I just ordered another one plus subwoofer poles so each top speaker will have its own Sub. Thank you zZounds for the awesome customer service.                
Pros - These speakers sound great, solid bottom and crisp highs.  Not too heavy to heft onto a tall stand, angled sides tilt for use as a monitor, they can be used as monitors or mains - I use them for both.  Love the metal grille.
Cons - The side handles need to be flat w/ the sides for the speaker to be used as a monitor,  these stick out some.  I'd also like a Speakon jack besides the 2 - 1`/4" jacks, but that's just being picky.                
I received my VS1220 3 days ago and immediately hooked them up. I am running them through a Peavey powered mixer. The power rating for the mixer is 200 watts RMS. When I first hooked them up I was satisfied but not wow'ed. To be fair I needed to spend some time and tweak the EQ to get the sound balanced. Then I decided to run them in bridged mode. This is when they came alive. They needed more power. I am now very pleased with these speakers. This kind of sound from speakers at this price range is incredible. My only small issue is that the highs are too bright and have to be turned way down to balance the sound. They may be better balanced with a compression driver. The final word is "BUY THESE SPEAKERS". For the guy that does occasional DJ'ing or small band gigs- they are an incredible value!!                
Great Sounding Speakers, very light, and have deep bass response, and vocals are crisp through the as well, i have the pmp 2000d mixer/brain/ and i run mics and instruments through these and they are loud and crisp, great products from behringer,  love em,                 
I bought a pair of these to replace a couple 15" Behringer molded speakers. They were just too heavy and I was too lazy to haul them around anymore. I'm doing quieter 'adult' type gigs now, and i don't ned the high power speakers. These speakers are compact, light, and you can carry a pair of them easily. They sounded great at the New Years gig I did, and I never pushed my new Behringer mixer past 4 on mains, and 3 on monitors, using a 900 watt 10 channel mixer. I have an older pair of Behringer VS1220 monitors, and I noticed they have a much brighter high end sizzle, but they also use horns instead of tweeters. So, I do a single solo act and use backing tracks and play guitar and sing. I had two of these set on the stage floor facing out, and two monitors facing up at me. For the dinner set, I was almost only on the monitors, using the mains for filling out the sound. I aimed the mains almost in a baseball diamond pattern, 90 degrees. The people I play for want to hear the music but don't want them pointed at their faces. Later in the evening I cranked the speakers up and they performed well except that I had to crank the high end up on the mains, my new speakers, cuz they didn't sizzle like the older Behringer monitors. These speakers were perfectly matched to the Behringer mixer, and none of the equipment ever seeemed to be strained or distort, even at loud volumes.                
Two ergonomic handles on the sides, easy to lift and compact. However it's worth noting that I did have one handle snap off one of my 3 year old monitors, how that happened I have no idea. When I looked into the hole where the plastic handle went, it looked straightforward to fix. Nice sturdy metal grates, fuzzy animal grey covering, sturdy rubber feet. These guys, like their predecessors, are sturdy and I expect them to last a long time.                
Plug and play!                
For the money you won't find a better made, high quality value for a speaker. I punched these little guys on New Years Eve and they cranked out the volume and low end and it was surprising how much bass they put out. Make sure you get a good high powered mixer to match these guys. 
The manual like with all Behringer documentation was well written, extensive, and clear. The speakers were packed well, plastic wrapped and taped, and had extra padding in the boxes. You get a Behringer bumper sticker in every box. I've heard people slamming Behringer products over the years, and I've only had one speaker arrived DOA. They are well made, sturdy, well thought out, and perform beautifully for the money. I've bought Behringer since 2003 and this is going on seven years of customer satisfaction. I just bought a Behriner GMX110 guitar combo from Zzounds and that also is excellent for the money. Buy it, you won't be unhappy, i promise.                
Behringer uses the same factories as Mackie and other name brands, or should I say the other name brands use Behringer factories for their products?! All their stuff looks unbelievably nice and high quality for the price.  I've been buying Behringer stuff since 2003 and push my equipment hard on special occasions. The stuff works tough, with spirit and keeps pushing out the music as much as I push it. When I was younger I used to worry about name brands now I buy what is the best value for the money. And I think Behringer is getting quite a good name now that they've gotten control of their quality control over production. You will not find a better value for the money. Period.                
Sent them a couple questions and they emailed me back a couple days later. Friendly, informative and made sure I understood the solution. One time I had a failed Behringer effect, and they directed me to a store that sold Behringer, and I received a brand new replacement and the store mailed back the defective unit at Behringer's expense. Good service.                
these speakers look great and sound great. they make me sound sexy! seriously the stuff looks very professional and clean on stage. I've been performing since 1970's and owned it all. this looks as good as any of the stuff on the market.                
I can probably use these speakers for years until I decide to sell them to someone else. The other pair of Behringers I got in 2003 are still going strong in another club down the street! If you're comparing these to another similar size by other brands, save yourself some money and get thse. If you're that worried about the name on the cabs take the grill off and unscrew the logo. But you will love these little guys. They have soul and will work hard for you.                
This is my first time ordering from ZZounds and ordered 2 of the Behringer VS1220f Floor Monitors and I am blown away. The sound is superb. I don't know why people put down Behringer, they put out a quality product, at reasonable prices.                
I love this company, Behringer is the @#$%! I have been building my studio using almost all of their product great value and this speaker sounds great. i bought this for the drummer in my band to use behind him as a monitor                
Good sounding floor wedge monitors.  Not the same quaility as my JBL's but they still sound good and are the fraction of the cost.                
1/4" jack....wish it had speakon                
Plug and play...what else is there?                
Can't answer this yet...only had them for a month now.                
Like I said...for the money you cant beat them                
NA                
I like the wedge design....but there is only one handle on the monitor, makes it sort of ackward to carry.                
As long as they dont blow...I plan on using them forever.                
Excellent sound, excellent quality, excellent value. I'm thinking to buy all sound
system for my Church from Behringer                
We bought these floor monitors for our son's startup band. They require a speaker amp to operate, but look and sound fantastic! One of the great features is the cross connect feature, which allows each speaker to power another. They seemed to be priced on the low end, yet seem to be very high quality. We're new Beringer fans, and will likely go back to them to add to the band sound system.                
These were pretty impressive. Good quality of sound at any volume. Price is nice too. Purchased 4 for our band and was a great investment. I have 2 name brand higher end monitors also and these sound just as good as they do for half the price.                 
Works great. No problems                
I bought two of these. One was to be blemished. The only difference was a small dent in the metal grate cover that did not effect the quality of the product.                
I bought this speaker for our church but did not know that there was not a volume control on the speaker. The quality was good but I had problems when I hooked it to our mixer. It could not handle the extra load of another speaker and therefore " slowed " down the song. I wished it had a volume control but it didn't so that lead me to returning it to the store. The people helped me a lot trying to find ways in which it would work on our mixer. But in the end , I returned it to the store for a refund.                
No, it did not have a speaker cord with it so you had to buy one if you did not have one on hand. Also, as mentioned earlier, it did not come with a volume control knob. The sound was great even though it did not have certain features as mentioned above.                
It did not have a volume control knob to change the output. It would not work well with the mixer that we had at our church.                
When I opened the box and picked up the speaker, I noticed that something was loose inside. I don't know what it was but when I returned it to the store, I did mention that there was something loose inside the speaker.                
The value was good.                
 The people were great to try and find ways to help you with your problems. I would still buy from them.                 
It sounded like a great speaker and it was when I listened to it but it did not mention that there was not a volume control knob.                
The quality of sound was great and the price was good but it did not have a volume control knob on it. And it did not work well with the mixer we had at our church so I decided to return the product which they had no problem with returning it to the store.                
I got a pair of these speakers and they sound awesome. I thought I will need to get a subwoofer to go with it, but to my surprise, I don't need one. These speakers alone have lots of bass and they are long throw, the further you are from the speakers, the harder the thump. Believe it or not, I use these for home stereo and TV surround sound. 
I was a little nervous when it arrived, the boxes show some damaged outside. I was there when the Fedex guy deliver it and I mentioned  to him that there were some damges to the boxes and he asked me to open the boxes infront of him incase there were damaged inside the boxes, but there were no damages to the speakers. They all came in one peace and not a single ding or dent. I was very happy that zZounds use Fedex instead of UPS. I could have ordered these from Amazon, but there were so many horror stories about UPS delivered the boxes damaged so bad that the speakers came in pieces and many had to be sent back. I plan to order the Behringer subwoofer from zZounds soon eventhough I don't need one.
The reason I bought it here is because of so many good reviews about this company and their fast shipping. I am glad I did because it is everything that the many good reviews said about them and I got my speakers in 3 days. I will definitely recommend this company and I will buy from them again.                 
Nice deep bass, the other reviewer is right. Don't need a separate subwoofer. I love these speakers. When I received it the first time, one was defective. Called zZounds at night almost 10pm. They picked up and put an RMA ticket in right away. Got another one by 2 days. I was surprised at how helpful they were. Love the zZound service. I've been using them everyday. They sound excellent, highs and lows and all. Would recommend to buy from zZounds. Would buy it again if they do stop working somehow. Nothing wrong so far. I am very happy with the purchase.                
Just got my speakers,got them hooked up,and wow ,they sound great. Has agood build quality.great bass and highs,would definitly reccomend for a friend to buy.also delivery was prompt and damage free,only took 3 days.                
The sound is totaly amazing it sounds better I think then my mackie 600 watt speakers and i paid three times as much for the mackies.My 1520 vs berhinger the lows are awesome the highs are awesome they sound great for any style of music country rock blues metal jazz i just wish I knew how they did it I will be buying more of there stuff soon      Thank Berhinger                
yes chords                
great sound all the time                
very nice looking speakers                
best bang for the buck                
Have not needed them yet                
tryed them out and had to have them                
for a very long time it will be hard to top these speakers                
Use Behringer gear most of the time. It is good gear at a good price. 
A great buy I will say..however..I purchased a pair but when my order arived I only got 1? Not 2! And I had a gig booked for the same week..I was not notified at the the time of the purchase or anytime after that I would only receive just one..so to say the least it put me in a pinch..it wouldn't have been bad if I'd known before hand that their policy is first come first serve on these restock items but I had to find out the hard way..and as a result they apologized but made no attempt to find a comparable item and satisfy the customer..I can't stay in business doing that and they won't get my business again.                
I personally love the sound. Again, though, I don't play out. This is not something I use for stage. I bought the VT999 solely to warm up the sound and give me good tone response going into my PC. It performs perfectly in that role.
With the gain on the VT999 around 5 to 8 I can get some rich, luscious, overdriven tube sounds. Less if I only want some crunch, or 10 if I want some full-force overdrive. The noise gate on the VT999 works excellently! And it's very simple to use - just like a basic stomp box. It can be barely noticeable or it can chop up your notes if you like that. I keep it dialed back a little and find that it works very smoothly, but effectively. Admittedly, my EMG pickups go a long way towards a noiseless sound, but the VT999's noise-gate adds a perfect final touch.
I haven't tried replacing tubes as I find that I love the way it sounds in my current arrangement. It responds just like older tube-amps I have used in the past, with beautiful tones and rich harmonics. However, after reading other reviews, I am curious to find out what other tubes can do for the tone. The idea of it being a starved-plate pre-amp is not detrimental to my purposes.
Most importantly, the pedal doesn't suppress my guitar's own tones. Those still come shining through no matter how I have the pedal set.
A huge downer, though, is that you simply cannot get a good clean sound. No matter where I set the gain and volume controls, I either get a mild crunch or the sound drops out altogether.                
I find all of the features are well thought-out for a 'cheap' pedal. You have the tube - the heart of the sound - and the EQs and noise gate, and of course a master volume. The bypass switch is very smooth - NO POPS!!                
You have to be an idiot to not be able to use this pedal straight out of the box. You plug it in and set the knobs to whatever you desire. If you've ever used an amp, you can use this thing.                
Well, the casing is built like a tank. It's solid and nothing rattles.
Yes, the knobs are plastic, but as long as you don't throw out of a 5-story apartment window or let your 4-year-old bang on it with a hammer, it should survive most road use.                
For my purposes, this pedal is a great value.                
Haven't had to use manufacturer support.                
Tube-in-a-stomp box ... for under $100.
And it works.
This has earned a permanent place at the front of my guitar chain.
But then ... my name is not Bonnie Raitt or Eric Clapton.                
I'm not a true guitar player - my thing is keys. I have my own little PC-based home studio (doesn't everyone, these days?) and I compose and record my own stuff. I use Elec Gtr to fill out critical parts in certain blues and rock tunes I record, but I have no stage amp and I never play out.
For me, the VT999 serves as a tube-based preamp going into my PC. I have an old Epiphone Strat-style guitar with EMG active PUs. I go from that into a Boss Compressor/Sustainer (CS3) pedal and then into the VT999. From there, I run it through my Digitech rack processor to add a hint of delay if I want, and then into my PC interface (Onyx Blackbird). I use the guitar channels/effects in my recording software to further fill out the sound as needed.
I personally love how it looks. It has a unique, almost retro appearance. But that really bright blue-LED light does annoy the h#!! out of me.                
This is simply the best starved-plate front-end I have heard yet.  This is my first Behringer product, and I have no prejudice against the company as many seem to.  I also have built several single- and multi-tube preamps over the years.  This pedal's circuit design is a success.  The stock tube was unimpressive, bland, and murky; but still not the worst distortion sound I've heard.  I substituted an old RCA 12AU7, followed by an old, generic 12AT7.  Wow... Each tube completely changed the character of the pedal.  The tone controls enabled dialing in the optimal settings for each tone.  Mind you, I've had the pedal two days, and I'm running it into a Digitech RP200 (to add a touch of reverb--that's all!) and straight into my PC with its tiny speakers.  IMO, this only increases the challenge for the VT999.  I was extremely impressed at the variety and musicality of the tones I was getting, with little thought or effort.  And I want to emphasize something---many players buy a distortion pedal, crank it to 10, and bang on power chords during their evaluation.  Even the WORST products sound decent when you do that.  The real test of this type of pedal is when you dial it back and listen carefully to how the sound breaks up as you're just starting to overdrive the tube.  Bang a chord and listen as it fades to clean.  Such testing separates the good distortions from the wannabes.  The VT999 does very well in this department.                
The VT999 is simple, straight-forward and does what it says.  I haven't used the noise gate feature yet, because it is so quiet.  It's nice to have, though.  Comes with AC power.  Sweet.                
I haven't read the manual yet.  No learning curve at all.  Just get yourself a Phillips screwdriver and scavenge a few old, used 12A_7-family tubes and do a mess of swap-and-listen sessions.  (BTW--forget about NOS tubes at this point -- until you home in on a favorite, just stick in whatever tubes you can find--stuff you may have pulled from Granny's Philco radio, etc.  If you find one you really like, THEN worry about hunting down a few NOS tubes of that brand.)                
Solid construction outside, absolutely adequate and typical inside.  Nice spring clamp for the tube.  Some find the spring too tight.  Mine seemed just right.                
The sound is fantastic.  BUT it only does one thing, so I think its typical selling price of around $70 is a bit steep.  But IMO it's a pedal you will use a lot, so that must figure into the question of value.                
Unknown                
I don't "lust" after equipment anymore...I'm too old.  This pedal is not particularly pretty, but it sounds incredible.  THAT'S what attracts me to it.                
If lost/stolen, I would immediately replace this pedal.  It makes me want to play, which is high praise.  Since it is simply a distortion pedal, it does need some sweetening with back-end EQ and reverb/delay.  In my experimenting so far, I'm not sure if I would attempt to use it as a DI box, but that would require more testing.  I'm eager to hook it into the effects loop of my Carvin tube amp.  If I had to change anything (practical) about it, I'd be interested to hear a version of this pedal with a higher plate voltage.  I bought this pedal because I know from experience that low-voltage tube circuits can work, but most are executed badly.  The reviews I read told me the VT999 was different.                
The pedal sounds really nice, it's very responsive to even the slightest of changes in the settings. Is doesn't have a really variable sound, as it will always stay quite warm and round, but thats also the case with almost every tube overdrive I've come across...
Someone may dislike the true-bypass on the pedal, but it suits me perfectly...                
The pedal is very straightforward - it has controls for bass,mids and treble, and has level and gain knobs. Also, it has a very usable noise gate with a threshold knob and an on/off switch. The power supply included in the package is also quite reliable, as I've used it with a lot of other pedals...                
Its very simple to make the wanted sound, a matter of seconds, really.
The presets in the manual are quite logical and usable, also...                
The casing is robust and can be kicked around a lot, so its very usable on tours or for constant gigging. I've had it for around 3 years and it survived some 20+ gigs and countless rehearsals. Only thing to watch on are the knobs which are made of hollow plastic and aren't replaceable.
Some pedals also have a faulty tube in them, so try out before you buy them !
Also, the blue power LED is too bright and will annoy the hell out of you if you use it in low-light situations (I've put gaffer tape over it)                
The pedal has a great sound for a very low price in comparison with other tube overdrives out there.                
Never had the need for it...                
It's a love-hate thing with this one - some think it looks very retro and like it, some think it is ugly and looks like a russian sewing machine - a matter of taste on this one.
It could get a better combination of colors, as this dirty-white with a giant black V gives it a cheap look...
In my case, I don't mind the look as long as the sound is right.                
I play a variety of genres (from electronic-rock crossover to grindcore) and this pedal has proved really useable for all of them. If it died on me, i'd buy it again. I may need another dist pedal with a more synthetic metal sound, but this one will remain in the setup aswell.                
I bought 2 and they both have inferior tubes. They barely light up and take 5 mins. to warm up to where there's no static. It muddies your clean tone and there is no touch sensitivity. The distortion is fantastic. Noise gate and EQ are great.                
I already have a good clean tone . I wanted this to add the tube feel to a ss amp. With these tubes it just can't get true clean, even with gain on zero. It is built very well with metal housing and jacks.                
It takes some adjusting to dail in.                
road worthy.                
Half the price of others.                
Have not called yet.                
Fully adjustable tube dist. for my solid state amp. Nice.                
This is worth the extra 10 bucks for a new tube. Maybe yours will have a good one. I am going to try a 12au7 for more clean. I am keeping both of mine.                
Got this to go low gain and sweeten a solid state amp. Put a lower gain tube in 12at7 and it does fine. Really shines when you scoop the mids and crank it, but I don't play that way! If you want 70's rock distortion, look no further.                
Buy this pedal if you want classic vintage OVERDRIVE sound. Then order a JJ ECC83/AX7 from Tube Depot and you will have a nice pedal. The Bugaria tube that comes with the pedal is definitely junk. For only $69.99 this pedal is a steal.                
 this is a great pedal to have around with solid state amps, but it shines when being used along with tube amps. I looking forward to purchasing more tubes. I bought an extra tube when I purchased this pedal since that really is the beauty of have tube devises. You can really experiment more with such pedals and amps and the overdrive is always better and distortion is always better sounding. This pedal is a great entry level pedal into the tube world. But kids this is not a real tube amp replacement. All tube amps are something very special in my book and has got me more way more into playing and sculpting my tone. This pedal is very interesting when you have a few tubes to experiment with. I wasn't that happy with the stock tube with my particular set up. I hope they make more pedals like this one.                
First and foremost,this is a "starved plate" circuit,which means that the 12AX7B Bugera tube that comes stock with the VT999(or any other tube for that matter)is not really getting the adequate voltage to work at full capacity.The good thing about this pedal is that it is a 9volt power supply,and it will integrate easily onto your board.Some would say this is a bad thing because it needs more power.I think Behringer has a winner here,but you need to change out the stock tube because it is a high gain tube,and the signal/notes "choke out" at lower gain/volume settings(which to me is unacceptable)After trying a few different 12AX7 types I settled on the JJ ECC83,which is slightly lower gain than a normal 12AX7.This tube worked for me really well tone-wise although I now have to turn the master volume to at least 8(almost all the way up)so the VT999 can keep up with my amplifier(Bugera V55 head)I bought this pedal to be a substitute for the gain channel on this amplifier which I thought was lacking.I only use the CLEAN channel on this amp and with this pedal,and I am very pleased with the results.Yes,you could probably find a better tube overdrive pedal out there,but it wont be 9volt power,and it wont be $73.00(I bought mine last year for $57.00 so look out the price on this unit is GOING UP...)I believe this overdrive pedal will work best with amplifiers using a 6L6 tube platform running a CLEAN signal into the unit.                
This pedal is very versatile,and all the controls work.For a classic rock sound keep the gain at 2:00 and turn the midrange to about the same,with the bass at 11:00.The treble control really works too so you can adjust the brightness to compliment YOUR amplifier.To achieve a more aggressive "metal" tone,your going to have to put a compressor in front of the VT999,and turn the gain and bass up-while dialing back the midrange.This is surely enough for ME.If you are looking to achieve a "death metal" sound this pedal may not fit the bill,and there are probably better choices for you out there.The noise gate works well,but I don't use it because again the notes tend to "choke out",however if I played a heavier style of music,I probably would use it;anyway it's nice to have it there as an option.                 
This is where this pedal shines.It just can't get any easier than this.I did take a magic marker to it to mark all my settings I use- but hell,I do that to almost ALL my pedals.BTW,a Tube Screamer type pedal after this thing works wonders to get you that "over the top" tube saturation tone.I run my board in this order:cable from amp,tuner,delay,compressor,VT999,Tube Screamer,modulation effects,wah pedal,cable,guitar.Just FYI.                 
I definitely would not beat up on this unit,because the control knobs go all the way into the pedal,right into the circuit board itself.This is not the usual pot/shaft/knob deal here;this is another Behringer "cost cutting" move that I've seen on their pedals before.The circuit board itself looks sturdy enough,and fairly simple.In fact,opening up the chassis and seeing all the room inside makes you wonder why they didn't make the VT999 smaller.??????Things that make you go "hmmmmmmm".....The unit is a steel box,and it seems very durable,just don't be stompin' on the knobs bro.On/off switch works beautiful,never had a problem with it yet.Time will tell.....                 
You can't touch a pedal like this for under $300.00,and it comes with a 9volt power supply and a noise gate built in.You're going to have to do some tube swapping IMHO,although I've seen some reviews where the person says the stock tube works best-not for me though.This is not the best tube overdrive you can buy,but it works for me and the price was right(and still is).For the money this is a steal.                
I don't think Beringer services any of their products,the best you could hope for is a replacement,or warranty from who you bought it from,or send it to Keeley or some some other mad scientist to get it fixed or modded or whatever.                
Beringer products will never have "sex appeal".However,I can tell you that I'm starting to see this unit at gigs-people are using it,mostly as a substitute gain channel on a 6L6 platform.                
I'm getting a really nice guitar tone with this thing,I've tried other pedals(solid state/modeling I.E.:metal zone,crunch box,fuzz pedals,distortions)and they just don't have the harmonic "richness" of a tube powered pedal.I don't really NEED anything else right now,I'm kind of pleased with the sound I'm getting from the VT999.Go figure.                
Seems to work well. Have not compared it to similar product from other brands. Still experimenting with settings.Like the control setup although am concerned about how plastic parts will hold up over time.good value if it holds up well.                
All i got to say is don't let the name fool you. just because it's not a boutique or highly recommendable brand doesn't mean it's trash. I would call it a overdrive/dist driver. It does it very well. I am glad i am here to witness what a good dist/drive box it's. Lets not be arrogant, this is a tube driven box. hello, it will replace some of your drives shockingly.                 
Let me see, tube dist/overdrive, noise gate, decently responsive controls. HHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMm not bad behringer.                
Fairly easy, it can be versatile and compliment your tone. do not try using a daisy chain with this pedal you'll suck juice and tone from it. don't be retarded, use the power supply given.                
I am giving it an eight only because the knobs are plastic and straight into the circuit. everything else is legit and good quality.                
A good value apart from the knobs. the price, sounds, and options make up for it.                
haven't called. The spring it comes with inside popped. i accidentally pulled hard on it so be careful it is a tube box...hello.                
I have it and like the vintage x-men graphic look alike from a marvel comic book. Born in the '90s.                
If this were stolen i would replace it, it has a good sound. really that's what counts.                
I bought it a while ago and it sounds great to me, but beware: this is most likely of the "starved plate" category of tube drivers, running at a low voltage. Google that if you don't know what I mean.
Other tube drivers like the Seymour Duncan have circuits that really utilize the tubes, but those were too expensive for me.
I went ahead and bought an Electro Harmonix 12AX7 tube after hearing that the behringer tubes are unreliable and sound bad, but personally I liked the stock behringer tube better than the Sovtek (behringer was softer sounding with less high gain) I could definately hear a difference, which means the tube can't be completely for show.
Overall, to my relatively untrained ear this pedal sounds great and gives me what I think is a nice tubey sound, and I'm glad I bought it since my solid state amp's OD can't compare.                 
The wall mounts are solid and avoids unecessary vibrations.                
The wall mounts are designed for the specific Behringer speakers that I had on hand. Accessories to hold the monitors were included.                
The wall mounts were easy to install with the proper screws from a hardware store. Mounting the monitors to the wall mounts was easy.                
High quality steel, well designed.                
Yes                
No problems                
Nothing sexy about a wall mount.                
I like the product, but the price could br lower.                
I have used this in only limited settings. I am very pleased with its very low noise floor. I have used three different type microphones: condenser, dynamic and acoustic guitar transducer pickup on stringed instruments. The transducer has the worst noise issues but can be EQ'd out fairly well. I also have a dual CD deck feeding into the mixer with no noise issues at all.                
For a relatively small board it has a host of excellent mixing capabilities. I got this unit for its FX capabilities and was not disappointed at all.                
I rate this a little low only because I had to go online and grab a block diagram from another similar unit. The manual DOES NOT come with a block diagram and there are so many nice features to use that without the block diagram it is not at all clear how to use them well. After I got the block diagram and only a little learning curve I have generally mastered the board.                
I have not had it too long but I was nicely impressed right out of the box. Everything seemed very solid-all the connectors, sliders, knob-pots, etc.                
For the mix options available, the flexibility and FX it is a great value.                
This steady mixer sounds great.
As I value ease of use very much so, I bought this mixer, expecting it to deliver me less headache then my former ProTools Set-up.
And it did! ProTools is history for me, now I use this mixer, combining it with the ultimate user friendly production software Energy XT 2.5 Plus. The results are phenominal! Even the reverbs sounds great, ass well as all the other features in Energy XT. My advice to all is, learn to use and experiment a lot with this set-up, and you'll be nicely surpriced how professional it actually works! It made me very happy to finally get rid of my over-the-top Protools Setup and start working intuitive instead. If you go for creativaty and inspiration, and don't want to let it get spoiled by endless menu's and difficulties, then this mixer, together with Energy XT, is the thing for you.                
Comes with standard software Energy XT (producing and recording software), but I bought a seperate package of Energy XT 2.5 Plus software. Together with the 1204 FX USB mixer it works wonderfull!                
In one word...........easy.
And all the highs and lows can be put right in the mix and recording...on the spot.                
Hasn't let me down                
Great value for the money!                
Buy it!                
i was surprised at how well the mic preamps sound on vocals,and the compressors are a sweet bonus. i've only used an allen & heath mix wizard16 live, and was very pleasantly surprised with the performance of the xenex 1204usb. it has made my home recording a smooth operation with the energy xt software, so...if you only need a few channels for live performance, and want to record with ease..you need one of these!!!                
I wanted a USB mixer with effects.  This mixer makes that happen just fine.  In my case, I work from a computer.  I use the USB port to channel sound from my computer into the mixer.  Then output the mixer back into the computer's sound card.   It does this flawlessly.   The effects are nice.  The mixer is good quality.
I wish I had some control over the USB audio.  I don't have any control over EQ or effects on the USB input.  But honestly, this is not necessary.   
The only complaint, if this is even valid, is that if I have a mic muted, with effects enabled, the effects are not muted.  I still hear echo or whatever.  I have to use the slider, not the mute button, to get a clean mute.
I bought this as a zZounds scratch/dent item.  This item was clearly open-box, but it was flawless in every way.  No visible signs of use or damage.  It was a tremendous value.
I wish it has blue led instead of orange.  :)
Overall, highly recommended.                
Once I figured out how to adjust the echo...its been GREAT!                
More than enough for my purposes                
Easy to work with.                
If cared for, should last years                
Pleased with quality for the price                
Haven't had to use as of yet.                
Compact but powerful                
No issues                
i was very curious how happy i would be with the xenex x1204usb, since i've been using an allen & heath 16 channel live for 8 years. but, i have to say i'm extremely pleased with the sound, both live and in the studio, with energy xt2.6 software it's perfect!! the software that comes with the 1204 is energy xt compact, which you can use to practice your recording, but the sweet part is, the upgrade to energy xt2.6 full version is only 19 euros!! all the other recording software upgrades like ableton etc...are hundreds of dollars. get this package!!!                
It lets me change and corect sound                
I love efect 14 it is pitch so i get a song take the voice change it to higher pitch mute some set my mic on 14 and say something diffrent as i record and it is sweet                
I rate this nine out of ten because iam nine so its hard to figure out but once i have its easy                
This will last 30 more years then i will get a 24 channell mixer                
yes it was worth it                
have not used it but is probly great                
it looks good with the pa its cool and will be even more in case                
28 years then i will make music and will need more channels                
this came with no software included. I believed it was supposed to come with energy xt, , amongst other things, per the behringer website. I got nothing, and now may have to return my mixer to get another one with a box that does include it? hopefully? I am in a bit of a hurry, so this is frustrating. I have a deadline. I still want to work with these products, but I just don't have the time to send things back and forth. I was happy that my call was answered by a live person, but he will have to do some searching to see if I can be supplied with only what was missing, or pack what I have all up again, and send it all back, to play a long waiting game of receiving, then sending out what I had ordered. A bit frustrating, to say the least.                
I was looking for a rack case that had a few spaces available for effects/CD player(s), but also accommodated a top mounted mixing board. This was really the only one I found that suited my needs in the price range I was targeting. The removable top, front and back panels give you great access from every angle and make it easy to quickly change patch cords, etc.                
It's easy to pop off panels and get them back in place. The only complaint I would mention is the cord access holes on the sides near the bottom rear of the case. The spring action to keep them in place or remove them is poorly designed. Spring doesn't stay put and comes out easily. I could recommend not bothering with them since you can easily route your cords by removing the entire rear panel                
Well made and looks good too. It looks rugged and I'm sure will last for many years of gigging.                  
Good price for this style rack.                
I like this case much better than my previous rack mount case, it fits everything I need to take on a gig and makes my system look more professional. Since I'm a solo Frank Sinatra tribute singer I'm almost always on my own at gigs, and this rack makes it easy for me to walk in with one case and a set of powered speakers and be ready to go in a few minutes. Only minor complaint, it is kinda large and a little rough for one person to carry when it's loaded with your gear, since the handles are recessed on the sides and a stretch to get your arms around.                
The sound from the mic inputs are crisp.                 
Plug and play even for the most novice.                 
Seems like it will last for a while, very sturdy.                
For the price this is an excellent piece of equipment. It does what some of the more expensive doesn't.                
Didn't have to use it.                
I love the design; I like that its compact easy to carry around.                
I will use this product until my venue calls for a larger one.                
This mixer is brilliant! I am able to record on my pc with no latency  using the inbuilt 16 bit 48kHz USB sound card . I now use the desk as the main recording source for any instrument with ease and combined with the inbuilt effects some very professional sounds can be easily achieved.
Effectively your pc can be used without a sound card with this  mixer as the sound can be redirected back via the USB return. 
At this stage I do not use this mixer for live gigs but I can tell there would be no issues.                
The mixer has inbuilt effects and  effect send/ return that can be sent  to any channel.
A good compressor is built into each channel.
Phantom power is available for any mics that need it.
There is only one thing I miss - no solo buttons on each channel, but for the standard of features this mixer has I can overlook this.
A Behringer ASIO driver is supplied but I use ASIO4.DLL with no issues so far.                
The controls on the desk are simple to use (even for a novice)
It may take a little while to figure out how to set up effect parameters as the instruction manual isn't clear on this, but again it isn't difficult.                
The desk is well constructed and attractive with good quality connectors, knobs and faders. The main mix send has gold tipped male XLR connectors.
As long as the unit is stored in a road case for transportation it should fair up as well as any other desk for live work.                
Great value for the features.                
I haven't had personal experience with Behringer yet but a close friend of mine has and he has nothing but praise for the efficient way his mixing desk was quickly replaced ( 3 days) when a fault was detected in it.                
It's a very tidy looking mixer, not too large so it fits well in a home situation.                
This mixer has all the features I require for my home recording and for what I payed for it I am very satisfied.
I chose Behringer under recommendation from a friend who owns a complete Behringer PA system and loves it.                
First of all, the product works as expected.
There is noise at very high gain settings, but it pretty quiet below about 75% of the gain range on any given segment of the mixer.
Used mostly with phantom powered mics and direct boxes with great results.
I thought it was noisier, but it turned out to be some poorly made XLR cables.                
Unbalanced 1/4" Main outs would have been nice, but it works great with XLR balanced line outs...and cheap adapters are readily available.
Bought this for USB track recording for roughly the same price as a 2 channel XLR in/out USB dongle of the same quality.                
The mixer was very easy for me, but for someone not used to mixers, a more detailed manual would have been great.  Also confusing is that the manual covers two mixer models.                
Fit and finish are very good.  I wouldn't take it on the road without a hardcase or a rack box around it (brackets come with the product for rack mounting).                
Yes, at 50% of MSRP or less, it's well worth it.                   
It just works and has a reasonable layout...but it's a generic hunk of gear that does it's job.                
Hope to use it for the next 4 or 5 years...currently I would replace it with the same unit and the same cost.                
I bought this to replace a similar model I have had for several years and needed two extra channels. It is a great mixer with lots of features..and sounds great. Very quiet operation. I know you can only put so many features in a mixer of this size, but I do wish that there were channel mute buttons on it. That, however, does not take away from the excellent value of the product.                
Best mixer I have ever owned hands down.                
Bought this for a one man show using backing tracks and occasional karaoke shows. This unit outperforms my expectations. Feature rich for the price point and everything works as advertised. Very pleased!                
Great little mixer for computer recording or small band                
Built in compression an EQ                
Plug it in and it works                
Everything seems solid and works                
Try to find anything close for the ptrice                
Had a different Behringer mixer that failed, Behringer sent me a new one no problem                
So far so good with this. I just got going with it and I like the quality, onboard effects and preamps and compression. Affordable and pretty quiet for what it is.                
I got my 16 input Behringer mixer this Christmas fro my diabled wife.. I have pwered speakers and this mixer is Great..But, when I got the board (one of my main reasons) was to download the softwire and record on my computerThe specs say (comes with ALL the recording & editing software you meed toturn yourPC inti a  complete high-performance  home recording studio..That was NOT TRUE..On the box it said to doenload FREE software  from Behringer.com and there is no FREE doenloads..My mixer should have came with the mixer like it said..I think it was a trick to get you to buy it and then lied about the software..Never buy anymore music equioment from them again,,I am very angry about this,but thr mixer is good,at least I am trueful,,,RickMcKean                
this little thing will satisty all your needs if you're like me, a one man performer or simple 3 or 4 piece band... I love it.. compressors ... nah.. not what I wanted.. but I use sonar X1 so got kool compressors with it.. great deal for the money...never happened to call the menufecturer so rated it anyway...                
Just from putting the headphones of my choice on AKG k240s and listening that way, I thought the sound was nice and pure. The mic I used was an AKG 414 TLII (the gold one) at least to say this little board did not insult me in any way. Next to the board is my big blue pre Focusrite ISA 430 MK II which is obviously hard to beat. At the end of it all the EQ, compressor, built in effects, its a nice package, and if you know how to use gear properly there should be no problem!                
As far as a compressor goes it does what it does, I have not had it long enough to say what I would use them for.                 
For the money, it smokes!                
I have been doing a lot of recording with this board. The quality of the recording is just as good or better than the Allen & Heath board I've been using in the studio. The preamps in this board are nothing short of amazing.
It is loaded with lots of very useful effects. Reverb, delay, chorus, compression, EQ, etc.
All of the effects are very high quality. The reverb is especially good. Very natural and rich. 
It takes some patients to get it linked with the computer. Be prepared to use a cable to hook up the first time. You will mosr likely need to update the firmware and download usb drivers from Behringer. This is all easy to do and only takes a few minutes.
The PC app is great. Very intuitive. The Android app is also very good. Not as user friendly as the pc app but makes mixing on the fly easy. I prefer the pc app for detail work like fine tuning effects.
Overall, this mixer sounds better than any I've used. I own a Mackie and a peavey. I've used Yamaha, Allen & Heath and other Behringer boards. The only one I've used that sounds as good as this one is the Behringer x32.                 
This is my first sand alone ALL digital mixer so I have nothing previous to compare it to. Having said that my only warning to anyone looking at this is there is a relatively steep learning curve. There is a USB port for multi track recording to a computer or iPad, but the audio signal path is access ONLY thru wifi on a computer, iPad or Android device. Getting past the wifi connection, the depth of control is massive and can be overwhelming. Every channel has built in phantom power if needed, a gate, compressor, EQ, Level, Panning and 4 Aux sends. On a physical mixer, this amount of knobs can look intimidating, and in the digital world it can be equally so. Getting past the complexity, the main reason for this device is the amount of channels and the quality of the sound.  For the price, I don't think anything touches the number of inputs and the quality of the preamps is far greater than the price would suggest. The channels sound clear and clean with no noise even at high gain levels. There are a lot of videos online that give tutorials on how to use this beast and be prepared to watch them as mixer has very little included documentation. But that's what the internet is for right? There is a better manual/web page online as well. It may not be simple, but it a great piece of gear and except for the complexity, I can't imagine anyone being unhappy with this mixer's quality and flexibility. 16 input channels (all individually record accessible), 6 physical aux sends, dozens of effects for delay, reverb, compressor, eq, overdrive, leslie speaker and more, midi and USB connectivity.                
I received two weeks ago and waited until I purchased a tablet to download the X AIR App. It took me 15 minutes to figure out the basic mixer functions. All I can say isWOW!
The music sounds at high volume levels like the band is there. I have it feeding signal to two B15x powered speakers and it so impressive how each instrument is audibly accounted for. The bass notes can be attenuated ratio to mid-high frequencies for spectacularly well balanced sound reproduction. I have set the speakers to neutral settings across the equalizer grid and set the frequency crossover points with the xair personal settings.I will never need to experiment with another mixer. True digital fidelity.                
This mixer works very well. I wish the reverb was a little better but maybe I haven't played around with it enough.                
I'm really happy with the amount of features this thing has. It's got compression and a low cut on each of the mic inputs, a good amount of effects, and a 9 band eq. It has more features but those are the main things I use and can remember at the top of my head right now.
And not only is it a full fledged, versatile mixer, it also works as an audio interface! So that's two for one! You can use it for live performances and also at home for recording. Or even recording at live performances!
I've looked around a lot and did a lot of research and couldn't find such a feature loaded mixer for the same price as this one.
I use this mixer with a shure pg81 mic and behringer b212d speaker to amplify my flamenco guitar. I need something with more control that's why the 9 band eq is so useful. Plus every room and situation is different so that makes the 9 band eq even more useful. A typical 3 band eq just doesn't cut it.
If you play something with a lot of dynamics, the compression can really help to set the right volume level.
The reverb sounds a bit funny to me. I need more time to get used to working it. In some rooms, it sounds great, in other rooms, not so great. I'm sure this is just me needing to work with it more. I've heard other reverbs from other mixers and they weren't that great sounding either.                
It's pretty simple to use if you've worked with mixers before. The layout is simple and straightforward.
You might need to do some reading if you've never worked with a mixer before to really get all the use out of this thing, but that goes for any mixer.                
I'm pretty impressed with it so far. I've had it for about a month now and have been gigging at least once a week with it. Let's see how it works out in the long run.                
I think I got a LOT for the price of this mixer. Well worth the money.                
It looks pretty good to me. Everyone always looks impressed when I take it out to set it up. I guess all the led lights make it look pretty high tech and cool or something.                
I'm really happy with this mixer and won't be needing to upgrade anytime soon. Like I said before, I wish the reverb was better but that could totally be just me not knowing how to use it to it's full potential yet.                
I love the subtle sound changes, that I can elicit from the keyboard and hear with this mixer. My vocals reflect all the modulations I am capable of voicing! If you can sing, this board really does the job. You can modify the effects (reverb etc) and you can fine tune where and how much is employed- GREAT!                
Nine band EQ- FINE! Feedback finder combined with the 9 band EQ reduces the wide swath cutting that occurs with fewer bands!                
Learning curve is short- very short. Instructions are basically 43 pages of basic information in 6 Languages- ugh! You can download the full Behringer manual and you are set to go! I repeat, my Casio PX-560 sounds awesome, crystal clear and all subtle changes are heard in this mixer/ ditto vocals!                
It appears well made. I take great care of my equipment, so I expect it will do very well. Time will tell.                
Best value to cost mixer on the market. I have been in and out of music since 1964!                
No contact                
I could make good music without it! But- I make BETTER music with it!!                
Have had this mixer one week. This is an incredible device. Tons of headroom, crystal clear sound from my piano (Casio PX-560) and great vocals (Shure SM-58 Beta). The effects are very good (you can adjust parameters). EQ (9 band) is great, and the controls feel good- no slop. Compression, works very well, and the feedback finder s a great aspect. In actuality this is a 10 channel mixer (6 XLR/ 1/4 inputs) and 4 stereo) But for me this is no problem. The mains are XLR and I wish the monitor out was as well (I use QSC powered). For $249.00 this is an incredible mixer. Time will tell how it holds up. But, I have nothing but praise for this device!                
So far, a really decent mixer. The effects are great. It was easy to set up and get going. I haven't tried to connect to the pc for recording as of yet, but will be doing so soon. Used for a party and 5 musicians with mics, guitars and a keyboard.                
Behringer Xenyx X1832 USB Mixer has been reliable. Very pleased with the performance, I've pushed it to the limit and it performs great.                 
If you don't care about using the USB port for recording, this is a great mixer for the price. However, I am not probably 48+ hours invested in trying to use it for recording. Have tried their EnergyX SW that came with it, and two other recording SW packages I've used successfully with MAudio products, and I still cannot record. Playback was a cinch. But I've downloaded and installed the Behringer ASIO drivers, the ASIO4ALL drivers, and nothing is working. So I'm wondering if I have a bad USB port in this brand new mixer, or what? And I'm a 25 yr veteran with the largest IT company in the world, I know a little bit about computers. :-)                
Can't get the USB to work with recording, playback is fine.                 
Mixing and live sound if fine. Works as it should. Manual could be a lot better in describing how to adjust the FX parameters. Would have been nice if Behringer would have offered a software interface via the USB for adjustment and storing of the FX patches/parameters.                
Quality of the mixer main controls and chassis seems to be fine, probably better than most at this price point                
I'm disappointed I still can't get the USB to work with recording, and trying to make up my mind whether I was to return it or not.                 
Not easy to get answers from Behringer. They force you to search their FAQ on their website.                
It looked good, had all the right functions in a compact mixer.                 
If I can't get the USB to work on recording, I'll have to buy another USB recording device, and would likely choose something that comes with ProTools SW.                
I bought this mixer for live use in my band space and for small gigs so that I don't have to carry my big mixer and effects rack. I love how it sounds.                
The effects and built in compressor are both great features.                
Very intuitive. I played with it for about 30 minutes the day I got it, and had figured out everything that I needed to.                
I've only had it a short while, but it seems sturdy enough.                
For the price, this is about the best thing out there. It also came with some recording software, but I use Pro Tools, so I haven't put it on my computer.                
Haven't had a problem.                
It is much smaller than my other mixer, and it has way more features, though the inputs are somewhat limiting. If I have a big room gig, I will have to carry my full set up to mic all instruments, but for rooms where vocals are all that need to be amplified, this baby is perfect.                
I would buy another if it was stolen.                
great sound for the money. love the new compression control knobs                
mics and music from computer are used most because of karaoke gigs  reverb is also used a lot                
never had problems i have two of these                
Ive had this mixer for about 2 weeks, i love the looks of it, and it is completely functional with plenty of inputs & outputs that you might need. The manual however, lacks something to be desired. Not everyone is a sound engineer, so for those of us who have limited knowledge of inserts, subgroups and so on..not to mention the various combinations of buttons that need to be pressed or left alone...the instructions came up short.  I did manage to learn most of it simply by trial and error....something i don't normally like to do.  So far I am very happy with it, Behringer helps those of us that don't have serious bank to continue with serious music.                
I use this for a karaoke/ live guitar/ vocal on stage. This is more than adequate for a club band and it is very quiet. Plenty of in/outs, dual busses and very professional sounding. Plenty of EQ, just enough monitor sends and it has effects but I don't use them. I use a lexicon effects unit which is much better. If you can't afford an outboard effects unit the built in ones are more than adequate. Most club bands don't need more that eight xlr inputs and there are four stereo channels to boot. F or the price this mixer can't be beat.                
Perfect addition for a home studio. I like being able to record from the mixers usb directly into my computer. Just go to the Behringer website and download the free audio driver so your recording software will recognize it, I'm using Magix recording software.
On the Behringer website hompage: click on support, then click drivers, then click on USB audio driver that has your operating system listed then download and you're ready to go, Now you can use whatever Mic you want along with instruments, you name it, very versatile. Great for a studio on a budget.                  
We've been using this mixer for a few weeks now and are very happy with it.  The effects aren't particularly impressive but are a little better than those on the Mackie CFX12 it replaced and the monitor out is a great deal cleaner.                
Good mixer for this price, I use it for my internet radio show and it give me versatility that I need to record form Mic to computer.                
Came fast and safely packaged. Coming up on my second payment and received a notice about it. Everything works perfectly.                 
I've had it for three days was mad as hell with it. But took some time to mess with it myself. And found out it. Works the only problem I had was recording and hearing the music at the same time. But figured out what it was. On mines don't know bout every one else I pushed both trs buttons in and pow. It was doing the job flawlessly. And I didn't change the driver for it. In sonar x3. Or had to highlight a lane to record. I guess the only time you have highlight lanes is if you are recording with all outboard equipment. Thinking bout ordering one more. You can't go wrong it. Take it from a producer,artist, and mixing engineer.                
It is a great sounding mixer. Almost no noise, great headroom, and great sound coming out of it.                 
The effects processer is great. The four aux sends are more than come in most mixers in this price range. It also has four subgroups, another feature most mixers don't have in this price range. It also has direct outs on eight channels and has inserts on all the channels.                
Very easy to use with any mic or instrument. I've used some different mixers and, apart from and Allen & Heath mixer, this is one of the easiest mixers to understand and use.                
Great preamps. Knobs and faders are good quality and can take a beating. All the inputs and outputs have quality connectors.                
Fantastic value! No mixer I have ever seen in this price range has as many features as does the 2442usb                
Anything you don't understand, Behringer's website has something on it to help you out.                
It has a very beautiful look to it. Behringer redid the colors and look of the 2442usb compared to the older 2442fx, and it looks great.                
I plan on using this mixer for a very long time, as long as it lasts, which will hopefully be a very long time.                
Hey gang. Semi-pro musician here. I have owned various Behringer mixers, amps, headphone amps, and other miscellaneous gear over the last 10 years and I gotta say I love this company! I'm REALLY waiting for the UFX1604 but it's not out yet (Behringer...it's been almost 3 years...hello??). Anyway...my older UB2442FX-Pro had a few channels go out and for the price to fix it I figured might as well get something new. I'm used to the amazing number of outputs, sends, groups, etc., (from the UB2442FX-Pro which is a very similar chassis and layout), but what really intrigued me were the compressors. I have a female vocalist with a LASER like voice. Her dynamic range is very wide which is good (and she does a good job controlling it), nonetheless in smaller rooms I don't want to cause nosebleeds with high volume notes. So on our first gig with the Xenyx X2442 USB, I dialed in compression on her channel to about the 2:00 position. PERFECT! I believe the term for the compression algorithm they use is "soft-knee" which usually means that the compressor kicks in gently rather than those examples you hear where the compressor "breathes" in and out. Whatever the terminology, the compressors on the X2442USB kick in such that you almost cannot tell they're working but they definitely ARE working. Her laser voice is capped and doesn't exceed the threshold and overall, our live performance has indeed been enhanced by the use of the compressors on this board. I love the effects as well. VERY nice reverbs. We don't use the other effects much mainly because we ALSO need some reverb on the keyboards and acoustic guitar...so trying to use the effect that has reverb AND delay wouldn't help us because I don't want that on the keys/guitar (again...waiting for the UFX 1604 which has TWO independent FX processors....Behringer...hurry up and release it!).Another interesting point to be made: I bought this "warehouse resealed" which knocked $40 off of the price. When I received it and opened it and took off the side "bumpers" (since I rack mount my mixers), I noticed about a quarter sized dent in the side of the mixer. I contacted zZounds via email and told them about it and they offered an exchange OR would I accept another $40 off? Wow! That is customer service ladies and gentlemen. On my part, IF I accepted the additional $40 off, I had to be happy with it and accept full responsibility (which I did...I seriously doubt anything can go wrong based on that particular dent...but ya NEVER know!). Anyway...great service.Finally...once I racked it up and hooked it into our PA as well as to a Behringer POWERPLAY PRO-XL HA4700 headphone amp (which I HEARTILY recommend), we, as a band, were off to the races. Great clean sound. Plenty of routing options. Plenty of gain on the mic channels. We record our gigs religiously via various means (direct out of the headphone jack into a Zoom Q3HD as well as multiple Direct Outs, Group Outs, etc., to a Zoom R16 multi-track) and believe it or not, as long as we are mixing well in real time, the direct stereo output to the Q3HD sounds GREAT! This has the potential to save us time since there is no post-gig mixdown from the Q3HD (like there is with the R16). Alright...I've talked your ear off...but if you're considering this mixer, stop stewing and buy it. You will never look back! Also...for those geeks out there (and I'm one of them) who are agonizing over the number of channels, number of Aux Outs, number of Group Outs, Direct Outs, etc., stop agonizing over the other Xenyx models that have LESS outputs and simply buy the King of the Hill in the X2442 USB. We're talking about a difference of $50-$100 between them all and you WILL need the extra outputs/channels some day...so just DO IT.I have SAID my piece and counted to three.Sincerely,Kevin B. Selby                
I use this board for live performances to mix everything from our vocals to electronic drums to piano & keyboard. I've rigged it to feed our PA amp with a separate feed for sub-woofer. The board is versatile, well built, quiet, has great effects and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. The one thing you need to get use to is the "British" equalizers. But once you get the knack, you're off and running.                 
The effects are great. The reverbs, delays, chorus, etc. offer a real selection to choose from. The board layout is very straight forward and intuitive and there are enough inputs to satisfy any small to medium sized band.                 
As I've said, it's very straight forward. If you're a smaller band and don't have a sound man, it's easy enough to set up and get the right sound... set it and forget it.                
I've had this board for over 2 years now... no issues. 
I have quite a few other Behringer pieces of equipment... no issues.                
If you're on a tight budget, this board delivers more bang for the buck than anything out there.  Ignore the nay-sayers.                
Because I also have a powered mixer, I once ask how the "power output wattage" was rated. I quickly got a response but it was a "song & dance" as they said their rating couldn't be converted to "continuous average watts" or "RMS" values. (C'mon guys, it's only math...I guess the low number would embarrass them.) 
But at least they responded quickly.                
It was a great buy... so I got it.                
My first Behringer mixer was a powered mixer which I stated in another review to be a waste of money. I said "get a decent power amp (QSC, Crown, Peavey, etc.) and then get THIS mixing board."  I followed my own advice and haven't been sorry. This boards got all the features I need and it works perfectly, day in, day out.                 
The X2442 is exactly what we needed to to improve our sound and to add additional elements to our performances.  At first the vocal group and the band had to have two separate systems in order to perform.  With the X2442 USB Mixer we can combine the mic's and all of the instruments on the same mixer cutting down setup time and sound check time, and that to us is a blessing.                 
I used to use a Behringer X1222USB for my home studio but needed the extra channels of the X2442USB. I am very pleased with the 2442 however, the one thing the 1222 had that I wish the 2442 had is a graphic eq. The 2442 has lots of bells and whistles that the 1222 doesn't, not to mention the added channel space. Both boards work well in a home studio setting and neither one takes a degree in engineering to figure out, although, I thought Behringer could have gone a little more in depth with their owners manual. All-in-all, what a GREAT purchase at a bargain price!                
Very nice mixer, simple to use. Like the effects it has, and it's rack mountable. Behringer at its best.                
I have a lot of Behringer products and have had a great expierence with all of them. For the musician on a budget the price point can't be beat. This mixer was put into our show from day one and has performed as expected...love it!                
For me this is an upgrade from the Behringer Xenyx 1204FX/USB. Seemed like the logical step since I am getting great service from the one, I decided to take a bigger step to the top of the Analog Mixing Capability in this series. I especially like the sub-group capability so I can isolate my feedback prone mics and instrument mics. Can't justify a X32 but for me this is more than I need without having to just add inputs with nothing to plug into them. The subgroup capability alone is worth the upgrade....and the BNC connector for a light. Great piece of gear with lots of use and still useable foot print. Now I can take the smaller mixer on the road and have not had to relearn everything.                
IT'S ALL THAT NICE AND CLEAN                
I WISH IT CAME WITH THE NIGHT LAMP BUT IT'S FINE                 
YES THE PRODUCT IS WORTH IT I WANT ANOTHER ONE SO I CAN LINK THEM TOGETHER TO GET A BIGGER BOARD AT A SUPER PRICE PLUS I LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS AND THE FEATURES                
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM                
LOOKIN GOOD                
LONG TIME LIKE I SAID I WANT ANOTHER ONE SO I  CAN LINK THEM TOGETHER MAY 2
MORE THE SOUND IS HOT ,IT LOOK HOT,FEATURES HOT,INS AND OUTS ARE HOT,COMPRESSION ON 8 CHANNELS DO I NEED TO SAY MORE JUST BUY IT AND YOU'LL SEE WHY I SAY I WANT TO LINK 2 OR 3 UP TOGETHER.                   
Have had this mixer for about 5 years. Out the box I had 4 channels not work. Couldn't send it back due to no other mixer to replace it with for my gigs. Other than them 4 channels it has worked great. Everything else has worked flawlessly for my live concerts and shows. Oh have yet to try the computer plug in or software as much as I would love too I don't have time. But it has been good to me besides them 4 channel's out the box being out. I use it at least 3 times a week and it's been good.                
I am a Drummer .I use this to Sub mix my drums this into our main system.... good. punchy sound & clean .....then I also use it to do small gigs with no problems...They have stepped it up                 
I checked up on this mixer, the reviews are mixed, so with zZounds return policy, I took a chance. This is worth the money, Im in a few bands from 2 to 5 Insruments plus up to 4 vocals, works great and easy to use.....Buy it.                
The X2442USB Mixer is great for the price. I've purchased other Behringer mixers and they seem to have stepped up the quality a bit on this model. Even though it's missing the talk back feature you can still pick a free channel and us a microphone. It just works! The sound is clean and for the money and you probably can't find another mixer in it's class with all of the options this mixer has without spending more money.                
This is a well made, flexible mixing board with plenty of I/Os.  The microphone preamps are good, although require a delicate touch.  The faders have a nice feel, the effects are limited but useful. The unit has an internal power supply which is makes it easy to set up or transport.  It is also rack mountable.  Great value for the money.                
AWSOME CRISP AND CLEAN                
NICE SOFTWARE                
DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY THING  THE SOUND IS GREAT RIGHT OUT THE BOX                
ALL GOOD                
YES                
NEVER HAD TO TALK TO ANYONE YET                
IT LOOKS AWSOME LIKE A RECORDING STUDIO MIXXING BOARD                
NOPE KEEPING IT HOPE TO BUY ANOTHER SO I CAN HAVE TWO SIDE BY SIDE TO MAKE IT LOOK REAL BIG                
I find the board to be very intuitive and soooo quiet I thought it wasn't on! Musicians I have used it with love the sound!Planning on getting another bigger Beringer plus more of their speakers.                
Once again very intuitive. If you have ever used a board you can just start this one up and GO.                
Beringer is by far the best bang for the buck.                
I will add another board as aformentioned.                
I play drums with a variaty band and the versitility is unreal. Ican run 6 mics for a main mix, then run a monitor mix back from the main board for headphone use. Everything is seperate and clean. I just got the board but hte longer I have it the more I love it. The preamps and compressers give the drums a great punch. I use this unit with a 4-gate and the sound is great.                
Could use built-in noise gates for drum mix.                
The effects unit is awesome.                
Not much more to say except for loving it in the studio!                
This is long anticipated unit that does everything very well, sounds great, and at a very reasonable price.  I use it every week, and it does everything well.  With the new FW 2.02 it just got even better, a whole new collection of FX, great RTA, and few other things added.  Music Group really has been working hard at this one, and it beats any competition.                  
i admit. this is easier than most digital boards but people writing reviews about how difficult it is to use has obvioulsy never even seen a fully digital board.. compression is amazing as well as CAT5..                 
I am very happy with the performance of this console. I have been using digital consoles in some form since the 90's. The X32 is truly a giant step up from anything else in the entry level digital market. If you are looking for a desk with many "pro" features, this is it.  For digital newbies- I recommend setting the console up at home while watching the myriad of instructional/tutorial videos on YouTube.                 
I have been a drummer for over 40 years. Always played with bands that had a sound tech so never really had to know much other than helping setup and run cords. Started a new band and we had very little sound gear so I decided to invest in a board. Purchased the X32 after a lot of searching. Out of hundreds of reviews I only found a few that had anything negative to say. I've have had it about 5 months now and it is just an amazing board for the price. I did spend time getting to know the functions and features and it has paid off. Another great thing is if you don't know how to get around the board there are hundreds of great tutorials on you tube. Take the leap if you are considering the X32 you will be glad you did. Also as far as the reviews I have read about the manual being small, Behringer now has a full PDF manual available on their website.                
This is a great sounding desk very easy to setup and get going. Effects sounds great and over all performance is killer.                
Im very happy with my Behringer X32. It's as advertised. Smooth pre amps nice effects, I'm glad I purchased it. Zzounds thanks!                
Very surprising. Sounds great. No issues at all. If reliability is half as good as features and sound quality this console will be a game changer. Once this has been in the field a few years we'll find out!                
I mix FOH on one of these 2 times a week, in addition I own one that I use for live bands and a Live variety show for FOH and Recording.  It's really a great package for the money.  Dynamics on every channel and built in efx are great to have. The Firewire/USB card is awesome to have as well. I can record directly into pro tools without the need of additional interfaces.   I do wish it had additional Digital outs, though the Stereo. AES out has been nice to feed my amp rack, as I can stay digital all the way to the output of my x-over and speaker manager.    A Wordclock input would have been great so i could lock it to an external source, though at this price point, I understand why it's not there.   Overall I'm extremely satisfied with both of the boards. 
I've found the Mic Pre's to be pretty nice, and more than adequate for any live sound requirement.  I've done everything from Rock bands, to lectures, classical performances with it and have been quite pleased with the sound. 
Paired with the S16's it's a great combo.  Though adding a couple of those does significantly add to the price tag, I've found the reduced setup/strike time to be quickly paying back the S16's additional cost.   
I've not had to use Behringer's Manuf. Support, so I can't truthfully rate that. 
Ease of Use I think is subjective. I cut my teeth on SSL's and Large format Analog desks, and have worked on Digital desks since they showed up on the scene. As with anything there is a learning curve, and it's just a matter of learning how to get around it. 
If you've never used a digital console before, I'd highly recommend getting familiar with it before your first gig. It's pretty easy to get around once you're familiar with it .
The iPad app is handy if you want to check the mix in other area of the venue besides from behind the console.  The PC/Mac App is extremely useful I've found. Especially for adjusting Efx and entering the info on the scribble strip.                  
Through the years I have used some Behringer products, some good, some OK, and some well, not so good at all. I slowly phased out most through time, but I still have a few things. So when I made a leap of faith to the X32 it was definitely something I did my homework on. This is a great mixer in every way. I've seen some Presonus and Soundcraft digitals and would say I prefer this over them . A pro level platform all the way, compared to a :club" feel of the others. I had no problems with wireless control using a Surface Pro (though I do look forward to software upgrades). If you're looking for a pro level digi of touring grade on a budget, this is it.                
Sound is fantastic! The effects are easy to sculpt once you get the hang of it. It has a great ability to effect the sound just as you want. You can stack up to 4 effects on a single channel and that's great for my field.                 
Great features with the visual eq I wish there was a signal eq in it though. Or in ither words an rta meter. Again the effects are top shelf                
Easy to use once you work with it and going from an analog to this digital can take some getting used to. Main thing is don't over complicate it cause it has good ease of use!                
I keep having to tell myself it is not a behringer! This is a Midas all day! It's like the little brother to the midases though!                 
Great for value!                
TERRIBLE!!!!! Behringer a support is a phone loop of death that will lead you to no where and make up you end up smashing your head into the board until something happens. BUT if you call Midas they will get you squared away!                
Very clean and sexy!                
Great board overall.                
the best                
my experience with the beringer x32 is not that great till now, the owner's manual only has a few pages in english for it's tutorial.it's lack of good instructions very difficult to understand since they have shrunk it.;you connect its' output to the amps and there is noise.they should have made it easy as a analoge board.i am waiting to see if they are going to sell a tutorial dvd, which i have already looked it up but no luck, i try to go to you tube but the information i want doesnt show up.it is very difficult for and expensive equipment and you cannot use it because there is no help from the owner's manual.                
This is long anticipated unit that does everything very well, sounds great, and at a very reasonable price.  I use it every week, and it does everything well.  With the new FW 2.02 it just got even better, a whole new collection of FX, great RTA, and few other things added.  Music Group really has been working hard at this one, and it beats any competition.  If you won't need all 32 inputs at the console, this does everything just like bit brother X32.  I am very pleased with it.                
This console is great! I was a bit leary about spending this kind of money on a Behringer product but it is every inch as good as everyone says it is. We use this as our main console in our home studio and our live mixer as well. Being able to save settings for our studio and different venues saves a ton of time. Wrapping your head around the routing is a major pain the butt at first but once you have it down everything is pretty intuitive. We had to call support a few times and they were awesome as well. They were able to work with a console on their end and gladly walked us through whatever we requested. On a closing note......... We have seen the x32 as the main console at every medium size venue we have played or been too lately.                
I used this board with protools 11 and studio one DAW and it works super great. Great Midas pre amp and no need for any external gear with this mixer. I used it in my recording studio and also have the p16m for my artist to hear and they enjoy every moment in the studio.                
I bought this mixer on the recommendation of a local pro sound man to replace a Presonus StudioLive16-4-2. It came highly recommended. This mixer is loaded with "bells and whistles and is therefore quite complex, the owners manual is 74 pages, for example. It was really overkill for my application, a traveling weekend Acoustic Gospel band. I am really the only sound techie in our band, and I play bass. Our sound person is very inexperienced, and we use an ipad our front to mix sound. I was also looking for something a little more compact. I returned the board without even using it with our band.Here is my take: The X32 compact is slightly larger and heavier than the Presonus. I was disappointed in the laminated scribble strips, they were very hard to read. Another thing was the inability to assign the 16 main sliders to the 16 inputs all at one time, that is, only the first 8 sliders could be assigned to inputs (1-8, 9-16, etc.). Also a wireless router is required to connect to an ipad. Another I really missed was the lack of factory pre-sets for channel settings, etc.On the plus side, the mixer seems to be of very high quality, the motorized faders were ultra-cool, and it is loaded with features.                
I bought a board from these people sx4882 and they never corrected a problem in manufacturing that should have been by the time I ordered it and now I have crap board from a company that doesn't respond DO NOT BUY ANY BEHRINGER PRODUCT there's a reason why it's cheaper it's crap !!!!!!!!                
This is a very complex and difficult mixer to learn. It's not like you can power it on and go, like a hardware based mixer with actual faders and knobs. It's all done via an iPad. Granted you can used the onboard knobs to make changes but you wouldn't want to because it's a lot of pushing, turning, and clicking, besides the knobs not being inline with the menus makes it very difficult to use at first. But that's the initial "Hump" if you will, that you need to get over. Once you get a grasp of this amazing audio mixer, it is really pretty incredible. You'll spend some time watching YouTube videos and doing research since the manual it comes with may as well be taken out of the box and used to start a fire. I've never understood these companies (DAW's included) that send you these complex devices with very little instruction. You have to buy books, watch videos etc to even begin to use them. I made the mistake of trying to figure this out a week before our first gig. That was the most stressful week of my life. I did get through it and I did figure out enough to get the mains and monitor mixes working but it was no easy task. This IS NOT user friendly by any stretch of the imagination. But take your time, give yourself ample time to learn this and you will be overly satisfied with its features and abilities. Clean and quiet, and very very powerful. This thing has built in effects racks, you can use it to crossover your frequencies, there are eq's built in etc. You'll really dig this thing. Once you learn it. Believe me I almost said forget it and bought a normal hardware mixer with faders and knobs. But I stayed the course and figured it out. I'm glad I did. Love it now.                
After playing an standard set for almost 20 years it is a change to sit behind an electronic one. I bought this set to practice on but would not hesitate to use it in a gig. Setting it up was really quick, the sound that came with it are really good. I like the fact that the cymbals can be choked and that all of the pads are dual zoned, plus there is additional inputs for another drum pad and cymbal pad for later expansion. The brain is easy to use, easy to navigate and everything can be customized. All in all, you will not find a greater deal in a electronic drum set. I highly recommend this set.                
I've owned a few electric drum sets in my time (Alesis).  These are very good drums, great sound and features.  Real feel.                
For the money, this drum set seemed to offer a lot at first.  Indeed, if the unit were more robust, it would be a great value.  Unfortunately the set felt flimsy when I first set it up, and sure enough the kick pad stopped working after only 4 months of relatively light use.  I submitted an RMA request, and instead of just shipping me a new pedal, I had to go through the process of shipping the pedal out (at my expense) and waiting for it to be repaired, which will delay my recording for who knows how long (I am using it as a midi interface for Superior Drummer).  Despite my pleading with Behringer's outsourced customer service company to work with me, shipping the pedal back for repair was the only option they offered.  To the employee's credit, he offered to "expedite" the processing, whatever that means.  I have read many reviews where customers experience similar issues with the kick pad on this drum set.  I suppose this is my fault for not heading the advice of others and relying on a Behringer product for something as crucial as recording.  You get what you pay for, and I don't plan on making that mistake again.                
I bought this unit in May 2016 and have used it a few times to record. It is now early August and the kick drum trigger doesn't work.
I haven't even finished paying the 4 pay plan and now I need to send it to Behringer for repair.                
set is defective out of the obx. Behringer is aware of the issues with snare and kick responsiveness. Behringer will not back product nor can you get parts. So done the rode if something breaks, buyer would be out of luck and have to scrap the whole kit.                  
Compared to my Mackie - best not to. But I bought this little guy to ride around in a Pelican case and travel to seminars to run background music, movie sound tracks, and the audio from Flash and PowerPoint. For that it's fine and the tiny size is a real plus. Not much noise, and the preamp is better than OK for PA and simple voice tracks.                
No accessories, though the dedicated external power supply is a pain. It's big and heavier than the mixer. Worse than that, Behringer scrimped and made it single voltage. Not a problem if you don't travel. If you do and an over-anxious "helper" plugs it straight into U.K. mains and fries the 120v power supply with a quick pffffft, you'll lament the absence of dual-voltage when they were 'conceiving and designing' this thing in Germany for a Chinese factory to churn out. Lots o' luck getting parts - or a response - from Behringer. For the price, consider this item expendable.                
For my purpose it's plenty. Everything is straight forward and clear. Even the manual is OK. There's actually lots of flexibility for such an inexpensive product.                 
See above for "on the road" - single-voltage power supply. Mine has a slot in a padded case with lots of other gear and gets on fine. You can't bash it around, but one held up for 3 years just fine. The mechanics are surprisingly good. As to the quality of the electronics, I'll know when something breaks. So far so good.                
It's good value.                
Have one lying around with a fried power supply. Multiple emails to "service centers" listed on the Behringer website have gone unanswered, as has a query to the company, itself. A year ago I asked about dual-voltage or 240v power supplies and got no response. I'm giving them a 2 because they didn't have the opportunity to be obnoxious.                
Does pretty much what it pretends to do. No glitz or glamor, but functional enough.                
Size and weight are important in this portable application. I've replaced one already. The power problem is the big annoyance.                
Bought this for my small home studio.  I run Behringer electric drums and guitar through it.  I also run my phone and or laptop for playing music.  I was connecting my phone directly to my  Behringer B110D powered speaker and Behringer vq1500d powered sub with a stereo to mono 3.5 to XLR cable.   Before the mixer the sound was OK, but I had a lot of clipping and had to turn the speaker and sub's volume up to almost max in order to get the music loud.  After hooking up the 502 mixer, I have my speaker and sub volume under half, no clipping and the sound is clear, loud and just powerful!!!  At first I was not happy with the sound I was getting, get the mixer.  It made all the difference.  My drums are twice as loud with no clipping.                
I operate two full time internet radio stations. www.479xx.com and BoilerRadio.com and always need new equipment.I have always loved the board......the 502. .big tasks in a small package...for not a whole lot of money. and the service was awesome.......just what they said.....and quicker than they said it would arrive.                
This product works exactly how i want it too and its perfect for the job. the only problem that i have with it that pretty much only will affect some people, is the power cord. its very bulky and space taking but thats because i have it in a briefcase for easier transportation. if you have it set anywhere with space then that shouldn't be a problem. overall great product for running simple sound                
I needed a small mixer to add my keyboards together to one amp. This is perfect for my needs, with everything I want in a small package.In addition, it is stereo with panning for the inputs. This will allow me two outputs to add a bass amp and each channel can be adjusted to give a balance to each amp. Hope to try this soon. Lee                
HA! I just got this today..can't remember having this much fun and improving my set up for only 45 bucks...                
Very compact and light..no accessories included.                
Don't count on the owners manual to figure it out; it's poorly written. No helpful diagrams, nothing..Oh and a bit of a surprise, no on/off switch, have to manually unplug it..                
It does feel solid. Nice to plug in with the pre-amp, the mic, effects, guitar, drum machine and control it all though the mixer. Great tone though the headphones..                
Bargain really..                
Ummmmm..checked the website for helpful hints on how to hook up everthing; what is the function of the "main" ect. And nothing..                
Looks like the real deal only smaller. If I order one again I'd get the the 08 instead of the 05.                
At this point I'm very satsified with the sound quality and the functions.                
I cannot call myself an audio engineer with my 16 years,but still i HAVE used some of the best consoles avalible : I've worked with Fairlight consoles,the SSL's and many more classic consoles.Though i was always taught to FLEE from Behringer,when the time came for me to assemble my home studio,the pocket dictated.And so i bought this mixer and guess what-it's just as they said it would be!                
Though the product had NO acessories,it sounded good with the c414.When i was called to do some Recording for a metal band,i saw this mixer and laughed out loud,but than i almost changed my mind.
The preamp is not even close to what they say! In fact,it just cuts the cake and nothing more.You can use it until you buy a stand-alone and it will have a descent quality,but for a 50$ mixer,what do you expect?
The small number of channels is NEVER going to be used up on this mixer.Why?Only one amp.But still,the other channels DO have line-ins,so you can plug something else into them.
The peak-meter was broken when i came to use the mixer and all,but i don't doubt that the colors were pretty.But when it comes to the BEST features here,i gotta say i was impressed by the separate Headphones jacks.i really loved it-i could monitor what was being recorded in the booth while the artists were hearing the MIDI Mock-Up perfectly on the phones.
And there are the Tape and Mix options.Awesome.Though in a mixer this small,you don't need em.
So why would anyone be stupid enough to buy this mixer?Phantom Power.
Just plug-in a 80$ preamp in a Line-In,Plug the Mic in the Pre,and you're set.At a price of like 50 dollars,i guess it's worth buying.
Definitely getting one for MY studio.                
Yes it is easy,though the manual couldn't be more unclear.                
Behringer,bros!
Even if it's a 6000$ console - and behringer will NEVER make a console that pricy- the quality will suck.Why?made In China.Plastic.End of story.But may i remind you again....50 bucks!                
yes...because no1 sells this cheap mixers.                
uuuh behringer.That's all i gotta say.                
Well it has no sex appeal at all.The plastic looks awful.                
I think that it's a must for any newbie in recording,because it's almost a Starter Set in studios.                
There may be preamps that sound better than the ones in this mixer, but they cost hundreds, or thousands.                
Really good headphone amp, worth the price of the whole unit.                
Never dealt with Behringer.                
I had a bigger Behringer mixer and its power supply died; it shorted out after the plug got smashed in transit.  It was about the same price to buy this smaller unit (including a new power supply) as to buy the power supply alone, plus nobody had the PS in stock.  This is the third one of these mixers I've bought, and if one broke or I needed another, I'd definitely buy the same product again.                
Bought this one to replace the exact same model that had the headphone jack/Amp burn out. This one did the same thing in a matter of days. Not sure if I was doing something wrong. I was using it as a headphone amp, had a computer sound output (rear speaker) going into the "tape - in" jacks, and was using the stereo headphone out jack. Could smell it burning both times, both time burned out the same tiny surface mount resistor.                
I'm not using it as a mixer but only to control the audio volume from a DVD player toan embedded house built-in speaker system via a XLR wall socket connection tothe house amplifier, which I cnnot have access to once it is turned on............this device suits this purpose very well and its simplicity is a plus                
This gets the job done just fine. I use it just playing music from my computer. I use the Behringer UCA222 USB soundcard going into this mixer and my monitors going out of that. Very clean sound. 
I plan on eventually running my UBB1002 into the inputs on here for recording but have not tried that yet.                 
For what this has it has plenty. 
One of the main reasons I wanted to review this is, I read many reviews and none of them stated this has NO POWER SWITCH. I found that odd as I have never seen a mixer with out one and I find it inconvenient. I can look past that and just pull the plug each time I am done with it I guess.                 
It will last while it sits in place on my desk but I wouldn't want to do any traveling with this.                 
Love it so portable yet advanced Got it with the podcast USB kit but it does all my work perfectly. Come ON BEHRINGER!                
Cables,Mic.,U-CONTROL Interface                
Easy a Dog could use it, i had no experience and now one of a few who got 35th on NME Ameuteur Remix Charts Of Australia                
Made well (Dont Throw or blow up)                
Good value for the  price.                
needed a repair after a flight on virgin. But i didnt pack it well                
Sexy Portable Design feutures got a girlfriend from it thanks behringer                
Help with your goals but if you are serious look for its older brother 1002                
The sound quality after whatever I play is hooked to it sounds awesome.                
I like that you can even hook up CD Player/MP3 Players to it via RCA. That's a HUGE plus.                
Very easy to setup & there are so many different ways to get sound into.                
Extremely sturdy & durable. You would think it cost more from it's solid construction.                
Most certainly worth the money I wouldn't mind paying more for it.                
Haven't had to deal with support thus far.                
It looks very professional. I must be honest I feel in love with the look at first..                
I absolutely love this mixer! This is my first mixer ever but it has everything I need plus more. The Best part I would say is it's compact design. Fits nearly anywhere possible. I officially rep #TeamBehringer from here on out...                
The audio (going through the mixer and my Focusrite 2i4 interface sounds clean with little to no reduction in audio quality. I can still hear smaller details.                
Doesn't have too many features, or too little. The EQ is nice to have, although I don't need it. I leave it flat.                
Very simple to use. For a newbie, it might look like a lot, but once you figure out what does what, it's very simple. This is the same with most mixers, though.                
The mixer is built very well, although it wobbles on my desk as if one corner isn't touching the table. It's not much of an annoyance, but I thought I would mention that.                
This mixer is definitely worth the price, especially if you only need to hook up a few instruments in your home studio.                
n/a                
I am using this for a few instruments (A Yamaha MM8 piano and a Moog Little Phatty.)                
Excellent little mixer. Exactly what I needed for my PC DAW. The mic pres are very good. They're clean with lots of gain. I had my Great River patched in at first but after some experimenting I found I didn't need it. I was surprised at the comparisons. The on board pres come very close.                
Great features for the price. Especially the monitoring system. Very convenient. Behringer should've installed an on/off switch but no big deal. I just plugged it into my Furman power conditioner. Problem solved.                
Just plug in and start recording.                
It's built very well and so far has been very reliable. Knobs are tight and the housing is very sturdy.                
Without question. Big bang for the bux!!I'd really like to check out some of Behringers other mixers after hearing this little guy.                 
Never needed them but I've heard they are great.                
As long as it lasts. I would buy another in a NY minute if something happened to this one.                 
Great mixer. It helps to boost the sound quality and also provides additional input/output to hook extra mic or equipment. Thanks to zzounds for making my purchase affordable and possible.                
Very quiet, no hum.  Smooth operation, sq works well, sounds great!  I got this to go 
with two Mackie MR5 powered reference monitors I snagged for $99 each.  For less than $250 I have a 110 watt sound system.                
Blue power-on led is outrageously bright.                
Easy setup, just plug n play.                
Metal case, quality design.  No issues-perfect out of the box!
Great value for a handy little mixer!                
Unknown.                
Hey, it works.                
I use it for live gigs - I run my acoustic guitar microphone, pre-amp, effects and synths through it - works great, very ow noise and plenty of headroom. Only wish it has sweep EQ on the mic channels but, for the price may be too much to expect.                
I initially got it to have something in the home to allow multiple hook ups when streaming live sets to the Internet. I was impressed with the ability to set it up and within minutes of opening the box, I was good to go. The only thing I do not like is that  it does not have a power button.                 
The sound quality is very good for that price.                
There's a lot of features such as effects send/return, phones preview and phantom power.                
Plug in the power supply, plug in your inputs and you're good to go.                
It's very well built and the knobs are durable.                
This mixer is amazing for its price!                
Didn't use it.                
The unit is extremely compact and it's very well designed.                
This is a great mixer at a very low price.
Pros:
- Phantom power
- CD/Tape Input
Cons:
- No On/Off button                
for a beginer its a great option, no doubt. i stared to record with this mixer, but if u can buy a mixer from anothe brand do it. couse its good, but not great. you get what you pay                
it has some good features, i like the EQ and the phantom power, whit all the features this mixer its a very good option if you want to have a litle more control of your recordings                  
Like any other mixer, no complains here                
its a solid machine, honestly. i got to reconize that. very good finish quality, never fail to me.                
like i said, its cheap, and has some good features and good finish quality for the price, just dont expect a studio quality results with it                
never need it                
sex appeal?? looks like a regular mixer, not bad, but nothing that shocked me                
i will recomend it ONLY if you are beginner, its a cheap option, and a good one considering the price but you will not hear anything close to studio quality. if you have the money and you are serious whit the music, buy a mackie or something better                
The sound is not clean. I use it for a practice area. There is very little headroom and the preamps are very noisy. I've tried it side by side with my Mackie 1202 and difference is easily discernible. The Mackie is quiet and has a wide range before you hear noise; not so with the Behringer.                
not much static when i record...                
with wut there is... features work great                
new to using mixers and i started recording in 5 minutes....                
looks great and works great                
definitely worth the money                
shipped rite away                
glad i bought it.. looks great                
ill prolly use this for a long time                
This is truly showing to be a very big bang for the buck. 550 watts, about 30lbs,has EQ, small and with handles.A real winner for me. It really does sound good and with lots of punch and volume to spare. $271.99, I could not find anything to beat this near its price.I had it for about 4 weeks. It was packaged excellent. Mounts on my speaker stand with ease. I play guitar through it,Keyboard, Bass guitar, CD player and use mics. I am very pleased with this product.                
has EQ LOW,HI                
Simple , loud,  sounds very good                
it is very solid                 
Biggest Bang for the Buck                
low profile and well designed                 
I want another one of these and then some subs                 
Clean...makes my MIDI files sound more better, i use midi files for my live performance...& i hooked up my keyboards with it & they both sounded good together.                
nice features...3 band EQ...high headroom pre-amps..just what im looking for                
as easy as 1-2-3, or a-b-c...i wonder if anybody can go wrong with it.                
metal chasis...plastic maybe sturdy too...let's see if this thing falls...hope not...                
well,,, worth every penny... just what im looking for...                
havnt used it,,maybe no comment for now..but the store i bought it was quite understanding..coz the adaptor that comes with the package is broken so i went back & they replaced it right away,,but ofcourse they tested it first...sucks...anyway i hope next time no more defective adaptors Behringer..ok?                
i have few other compact mixers before but this stand out...maybe i would buy a mackie in the near future but for now im hooked with this...i tried Peavey, Phonic, Yamaha & other compact mixers, but this is much better...                
well maybe if i would go on a more bigger venue that's time i would improve my gears,,but for now earning a few bucks a night,,what can i ask for..cheap on the price but not cheap on the musicality...                
The mixer is simple to use. I am only giving 7/10, however, for two reasons: (1) there is no on/off switch, so you have to unplug it to turn it off, and (2) it has a piercingly bright LED that indicates the power is on but is so brilliant that it makes it difficult to see the controls on a darkened stage. I covered the LED with black electrical tape because it was so annoying.                
The AC adapter plug is badly designed. It is difficult to connect because there are 3 small prongs on the end of the wire (like a PS/2 mouse/keyboard plug on an older PC) that connect to a female jack on the unit. The wire only fits in a single orientation, and it is difficult to tell what the correct orientation is. In the second month after purchase (shortly after the store's 30-day return period, of course) the female jack in the unit started pushing inwards and tilting, and the cord became even harder to connect. After half a year one of the prongs on the cord broke off, making it impossible to power the unit.
Note that the unit did not get heavy use--I only used it about 10 times before the prong broke off, and I am gentle with my gear. It probably would be fine if you plugged it in once in a studio and left it there, but it is not gig-worthy by any means.
The AC adapter interface should be like all the other AC adapters you have laying around the house: a wire that has a male plug with a hole in it, and a unit that has a female jack with a single prong in the center.                
The price is low, and the quality is commensurate. You get what you pay for. I will replace mine with a better quality product from another manufacturer.
To get this unit repaired under warranty, I would have to repackage and mail it to Behringer at my expense. Hardly worth the hassle given the initial cost.                
I needed a small mixer for gigs with multiple keyboards, and I wanted one that had the option to send separate outputs to my own monitor and to the main PA. This mixer does that, but the quality is too low for serious use outside the home.                
i was surprised that this actually made my mc-505 sound better. warmer. less digital.
and running my guitar through it, distorted or clean, sounds almost as good as my amps clean channel.                
pretty good features. most my gear already has eq on it, so the lack of freq. on the eq isnt that big of a promblem. im sure when i purchase some microphones, ill be wishing there was more flexability.                
i dont see how anyone could have a problem haha. very straight forward.
plug something in, turn the volume up, plug something out.                
only had it 2 weeks
seems very solid. knobs are very smooth, not loose at all. if i had a carrying case to protect the knobs i would have no problem traveling it.                
definitly worth the money                
no clue. no problems                
looks pretty good.. the plastic sides are a little lame                
i bought it so i could listen to my 505, my guitar, and my electric drums at the same time.(of course i cant play drums and guitar at the same time, i ment to jam with a buddy.)
what i actually got wwas that, and it warmed up both the drums and the 505. very nice                
The mic-pres are good and provide a clean sound.  I use them mainly for vocals.  The noise is pretty quite.  I'm sure acoustic guitars would sound great through this mixer.                
Just what I needed for vocal recording.  Happy about the main mix outs, phone out, and control room out.  It always me to monitor the sound perfectly with my small set-up.  I would pay a lil more money for a sweepable mids freq on the eq.  I would pay even more ($40 -- is it feasible?) for two sweepable mids.  It would allow my computer to rest a bit more, and it's hard to get a decent and dedicated mic-pre at that cost.  Oh, yeah, thanks for the RCA in/outs.  I would pay a more, also, for an optical digital out or USB.  (But I don't want a huge mixer.)                
I am self-taught, so I use it for mainly what I need: recording vocals.  I read the manual to figure out how to use the sends.  I had read plenty on it, but never had a piece of equipment to try it on.                
It appears to be built decently.  I enjoy the metal face, and don't mind the plastic side pieces.  The knobs ARE NOT loose at all.  If it lasts me 2-3 years, I would be more than appreciative.  I'm just wondering how long the mic-pres will last.  That's most important to me.  The earlier Behringer mixers have received pretty good ratings, so I suspect these new Xenyx's will soon get the same.                
It's definitely worth its price, especially if you're short on moolah.  Of course, there are other mixers that I would love to have.......but I'm not paying $500-$1000 for them.  At this price, I have learned some things (like digital outs/USB) have to done away with.                
Haven't had to use them.  My first time buying a Behringer product.  I am aware that music equipment companies don't provide the best customer service, so I'm glad that I received a mixer in working order.  Please, God, let them answer my e-mail/phone call the day I need them.  Pleeeeeeassse!!!                
It's a practical addition to my set-up.  If Behringer adds two sweepable mids and an optical digital out to this mixer, then I would lust for it.  But "lust" could still only command a fair price.  I'm no fool.                
I'll use this for some time.  The price and purpose go hand-in-hand.  Since I am self taught, and only record vocals at this time, I would look for another product if I started recording bands......or if I needed more fx returns.  Or if sweepable mids became a necessity to give my processor a break.  I'd rather destroy my mixer than my Apple.                
Never had a mixer before this is my first but it sounds great                 
The best for the price if you want to play some british 70s 60s rock                
Never had a mixer before took me very little time to set it up                
Everythings rock soli                
Worth spending the money                
havnt needed any                
looks better then any mixer ive seen                
So many options with this solid mixer... a true workhorse. One of the few small/table top mixers with smooth accurate faders, quality preamps and plenty of mic/line/stereo options. Why people overlook this mixer is beyond me! We also have an older model;this new 1002B is even better. These things are built like tanks. Runs on batteries, if needed. Unity gain is true on all channels,including master mix channel. Great for a small band, a drum mixer, keyboard mixer,etc. We also use it for a DJ mixer, alongside a laptop and a USB 2-2 Mackie ONYX interface. Love it for band reheasals!                
I am SO glad I found this on your site. As a composer/performer who performs with and without backup and numerous locations (some without a house system and even some remote spots without power), having this and other equipment that offer both AC and battery powered usage is invaluable. What's more is the fact that this unit allows awesome sound via its well enamored preamps and Phantom power (even when battery powered). All tolled... one could mic-up several vocalists and acoustic instruments and run them through a couple battery-operated amps and flood a moderate crowd using no AC power at all! Before this purchase, I was stuck, solely, with the few inputs the amps allowed (in my case, a total of 4 - 2 each). Behringer has earned my dedication over the years... not because they're inexpensive compared to others, but their quality exceeds the others!                
Great little mixer. Sounds good and very versatile. I needed more line inputs than mic inputs. Using it for recording.                
Sound is great. I use it on the gig and recording. No complaints.                
This mixer is well laid out. The only  thing lacking is the missing power switch, but it's a very minor issue.                
No problems.                
Great quality. Well-built.                
Are you kidding? I don't know how they do it, but I hope they keep on doing it! Well worth the price. I also purchased their XM8500 mic for using live, which is rugged and sounds clear - awesome value. Behringer rocks!                
Have not had to contact customer support.                
I checked around a long time before I settled on this mixer. I wanted the smallest mixer available with effects. Some musicians I work with have Behringer mixers and they love them.                
I would buy another in a heartbeat. In fact, I may get a second one for back-up when I have some extra cash.                
It has low noise, even with the gain cranked up on the microphone channels (with 60+dB of gain, that's really saying something!) I've made several good recordings with it - everything ran through it sounds good live and in recording: vocals through a condensor mic, acoustic guitars through a condensor mic, five-string bass through a direct box and electric guitar through an RP500. The tracks that I've made with it mix together well on my archlinux-based DAW (so very little distortion as well).
This mixer is clear and transparent. With tone controls at zero and "fx" levels at zero, it does not color the mix as far as I can tell.
Turning the treble (on the mic channels) all the way up can add significant noise however - you can't forget how to mix when using this thing (cut rather than boost if at all possible).
The pan pots are center-detent types. However, none of the pots exactly "center" the sound when the pot is in the center. (That's a common problem with center-detent pots). Using a meter or computer, you'll have to micro adjust the pans to ensure exact centering.
The effects are surprisingly good considering the price of this mixer. The reverbs are realistic, clear and usable, especially for vocals. I was only looking for a mixer, but the 1002FX was not much more expensive than the 1002 (same mixer, but without the effects) - I figured, "why not? - I can always zero it out if I don't like it."
For the price, I'm giving this an eight, only because of the cranked treble control adding more noise than I expected to discover.                 
Power supply included - it gets warm when in use.
There are center-detent pots on the tone controls, pan controls and the "fx" controls, making it easy to locate "middle" or "zero" (or almost, as noted above). 
I don't use the tone controls on the mic channels (I set them at 0). I use my DAW for equalization.
The mic channels and main have clipping indicators - very useful, especially since it is rarely obvious from the sound when subtle clipping is happening.
The blue power indicator LED is blindingly bright. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but something to know. It can be easy to see from a distance that the unit is on.
The phantom power works as expected - has a slow turn on and turn off time, as is common.
The effects - I like the reverbs. I've used the chorus and flanging effects on a bass for some interesting results.
No on-off switch. I hate that, but I knew that when I bought it. I would have gladly paid an extra $3 for a switch - that's about what an acceptable rocker switch would have cost retail. In fact, Behringer could have left out the tone controls (which I don't use anyway) and used the extra budget to include a power switch.
The mixer does not come with 1/4" male to RCA female adapters, so you'll need some if you want to plug in RCA equipment to channels 3-10.                
Easy to use, especially if you've ever used a mixer before. The only thing that might be different is the effects module - turn the dial to the effect program you want, push the dial down, adjust your "fx" levels and you have effects.
I read a PDF version of the instruction manual before I bought it, as I try to do with everything I buy. The mixer comes boxed with the same in-print manual (one English, one German and one written in eight different languages).                
It is compact. Nothing rattles when shaken. The paint and lettering seem well attached and are without flaw. It is encased in durable plastic and barring having a speaker cab dropped on it or something (which would likely damage the pots rather than the plastic housing), I expect that it will last for years. 
Since the power supply and unit get warm when in use, I am concerned that those may overheat and self destruct. Therefore, I don't leave it running 24/7 - for example, I don't run my home entertainment signals through it. I do, however, run it for up to twelve hours at a time when doing recording sessions without any obvious thermal problems.                
Compared to other mixers around the same price as the 1002FX, I'm satisfied with the value. It is worth the asking price. It would be difficult to design and build my own mixer with comparable quality for the price...I'm an electrical engineer, so I'm capable of that (just don't have the time, despite being hopelessly unemployed).                
Didn't contact Behringer - did not need to.                
I wouldn't call it sex appeal, but this mixer is laid out well. The lettering is easy to read. The knobs on the pots are color coded (white for level, black for pan, red for fx, blue for tone).                 
I like this mixer and expect to be using it for twenty years or so (like the RadioShack mixer this is replacing). It suits my simple "low noise, low distortion, one or two tracks  at a time with phantom power" recording needs perfectly. The effects were extra, but I've made good use of them. If it were lost or stolen, I would not hesitate to buy another 1002FX.                
Although is a good choice for entry level and home studio, there is a background noise which can not be eliminated whatsoever. The price is great as you can start at $38 for the 502, but you must be aware that this piece makes noise, not so loud but noise anyway.                 
I woould give an 8 in features as it includes all the ones you need for your home studio. You can connect a microphone, your guitar pedal effects, a CD player, your mobile, a recorder, etc.                 
Nothing to read if you want to start right away. Very easy to use.                 
The presentation of the product is very nice, looks quite robust, quite modern. I have given 5 as the noise is the main concern here.                 
This is perhaps the best point here with Behringer as my 502 mixer was just $38.                 
I have never had to use product support, so I can not rate it.                 
The general product looks great and very well designed.                 
This is a product that you will choose for the price; however, after 4 or 6 months you will start thinking to look for something with better quality as the noise will be there...                
I purchased this little mixer to use with the Mackie SRM150 PA as it has some nice effects.  It works very nice.                
It seems quiet and the effects are a nice touch.  You can download the effects page at the Behringer site.                
I ran sound test From 20Hz to 20Khz....from low to high thu the mic EQ's and up to internal clip...Witch takes a bit of trying...And the sound is great....I am very opinionated on my sound...Nothing but great sound to my ears...                
I gave this a 7 on the features, Not because its lacking...I got this model, tho if you want more features the 1202FX would be the 10 in this size mixer...                
not too small that you need 4 year old fingers to use it...but not so big that its not a great portable Mixer...Not overly heavy like it has lead in it...but still feels nice and sturdy...                
hey i feel i got more then what i payed for...in the good way...not that i think it should cost more but for something like this... worth every penny and the everyday Joe can get a brand new one w/ out selling everything they own to have something, That will do everything they ask of it and take a beating....                
Again I feel i got everything i ask for and more...                
yet to need it....The best type of support is when everything you need to know is eather just that simple or well documanted when you first open the box"...10 points..."                
LOL i want it because I already have it...LOL sorry just had to say that....Corny i know...                
I gave it a overall * not becouse its missing anything...Because its very down to earth...Plan...If you need more step-up a few models...But I am in NO...I repeat.."NO!" way complaning about something that feels this good you use and work w/...and still is not going to break the bank or skimp on sound quality..                 
Sound is Clear,  No distortion or unwanted Hums or Buzz. Our Acoustical Group plays a lot of Small to Medium size Churches.  Most have a P.A. but they tend have 2 - 4 Inputs / Mic's. Our group requires 5 - 8 Mic's.
By having this very small and portable Mixer, and piggy backing it to the House P.A. We can add 4 more Mic inputs in a matter of minutes.
Oh yea bring Extra Mic's and cables.                
So far the Pots, Jacks and slides seem to be Ok.                 
Pretty Simple to use. Hardest thing to do is to plug in the power supply.
It's a German Din type Plug. Looks a lot like the PS2 plug from your old PC keyboard.  Before the Advent of USB. Meaning  don't bend or force those little tiny Pins.  You may find the replacement power supply is $75 dollars. It has very odd Voltages  and you will never find a "Generic" replacement for it. Of course it will run 3 hours on three 9 volt batteries.  But you will have "Low" voltage for Phantom Power.                
Fit and Finish are good.                
At about 100 bucks, It is priced slightly below comparable Yamaha products.  However Yamaha is Known and Proven High Quailty Manufacturer.                
Don't know,  Never had to contact Behringer.  But they have a good Web site for Operator manuals and Product Specs.                
Small, Light and lots of Inputs and Outputs.                
Another 3 - 5 years.                
Very versatile mixer for the price point . Easilly accessible, clear concise, labeling. Great for a small combo. Would definitely recommend purchase.                
The sound is of really high quality i actually prefer this mixer to my Mbox 2 the mbox has too much noise these preamps are amazing                
it has plenty of features more then any other mixer ive seen i mean come on? On Board Effects on a mixer? b4 i would say YEAH RIGHT but Behringer pulled it off and made it affordable.                
I only gave it a 9 because tho its easy to use you have to travel thru alot of effects to get the one you want i mean it has 100 effects.                
The product is excellently made if i didnt buy this i would think it cost like 300.00                 
you have a lot of bang for tha buck with this one! just look at all the features and the PREAMPS...lets just say they could compare to Focusrite!                
i havent had to call them so i havent needed support so i cant really rate them on that.                
it looks good it sounds good and it feels good                
Im lovin it!                
Very quiet mixer.  I honestly just wanted a small utility mixer but I am surprised at the quality and will use it on actual recordings.  The reverb is very detailed sounding, not tubby or digital.  It is not capable of customized settings.  This quality of effects in a stand alone processor would have cost hundreds of dollars just a few years ago.  The reverbs are better than the flangers and phasers, effects that I don't really use much.                  
A lot of features for the money.  It has four mic preamp channels with three band EQ, effects and panning.  Then 4 stripped-down stereo channels with panning, effects, and level.  There is also an effects send and return, tape in and out, and master outs.  Perfect for a smaller project studio, a keyboardist, a songwriter with a few instruments, etc.                  
Easiest mixer I have ever owned and used.  You can just look at it and you can see where everything is being routed.  You will have to look at a separate sheet of paper to see the effects listing because it is a two-digit display.                
It has plastic sides but it feels very sturdy and has some heft to it.  The knobs feel very good, especially for a hundred bucks.  The design is handsome and well-engineered.  Reminds me of my old Mackie 1202.
I am very pleased with this purchase.  Probably the best $100 I have spent in musical equipment.  For that price you can get an effects pedal, a small practice amp, or THIS - A quality-built 12 channel mixer with impressive effects.                
I have not used support.                
It packs a bunch of features in a small space.  I do enjoy looking at it and feel that it is an improvement over the euro models in both color and design.                
I purchased a Mackie 1642 for hundreds of dollars more and it stopped working within a couple of years.  At this price I will not be so bummed when that day comes, perhaps it won't.  The Behringer track record seems uneven to me.  My compressor works fine and it is pretty old.  Some folks are not as lucky I've heard.                
Nice for the bucks, a fully loaded small mixer for the price of a stomp box. plenty of features, lots of in & outs. Clean transparent sound. Mic preamps cover a wide range for high to low output mics. Phantom power a big plus. For someone familiar with mixers it's pretty straight forward and easy to operate. Seems rugged/durable. Never have had an issue. The effects are great, nice sounds and lots of 'em.
I use this mixer for home based recording with another unit for a 4 bus out. Computer is set up with a sound card that allows 4X4 full duplex recording. I can see this board being used for small club venue. Has four mic inputs, plenty of outs for room speakers, stage monitors and recording simultaneously, or as a practice/rehearsal mixer. For the price you can't go wrong. It works good with all types of mics, eletric, condenser, dynamics, ribbons. Again the sound is clean and transparent, very professional. It is small so my two fit easily on my computer desk. i use mine daily, it's one of those things that helps feed my music addiction. I have only two minor complaints about this unit; 1. it has no on-off switch. 2. the headphone output is wimpy. Wussy headphone output is common to almost all small mixers this size. Half a dozen or so manufacturers use the same electronics/design in these boards. Electronics has grown over the past decades, A mixer of this quality would have cost thousands not so far back. This is one of the most useful tools in my arsenal of music stuff.  Easy to use so it's great for  beginners. Something I really have fun with.                
i play guitar and sing backups,and a few whole songs in a rock band, and this thing is gonna help my voice sound much better than going dry like i have been,i need anything to help my voice...lol...and this does the job!!!                
no power switch                
very easy this was my 1st time setting up a mixer and it was very easy!!!                
its plastic,but its a mixer not a stomp box                
awesome value!!! i would pay double the price for this mixer!!!                
i had a problem in the past with behringer with a guitar amp i bought,it took a while but they gave me a sweet upgrade...hopefully i wont have any problems with this mixer,seems like it will be fine though,ill give manufacturer support a 9 on my past experiance with behringer                 
100 effects to chose from and having the fx level on each channel and the main fx for the board is great!!!also the mic preamps are a good plus!!!                
good little mixer!!!easy to set up,sounds great!!! i give this thing a 9 on features because it has no on-off switch,i just went and bought a small power strip so i dont have to keep plugging and unplugging the power since the input to the board is kinda flimsy,the sound is nice and clear,to set a effect channel you want dont forget to push down on the fx selection button to set a effect or your just gonna be in the test mode lol like i did for a whole practice..lol..duh..(if the number on display is blinking your not set) for a $110.00 you cant go wrong with this baby!!! even in test mode i was happy...lol...but now i know how to set effects wow the sounds are great!!! i would pay double for this mixer,and oh yeah itll be great for our small venue playouts very easy to set up and small...                
So far, I have been blown away by these preamps. I have a mackie 1604vlz that I use in the studio, and wanted something portable so I wouldn't have to undo everything when we played a gig that required our own stuff.
I started testing this last week so I could get a feel for it before our next show. We were playing along when I noticed something...silence.
There was no hiss. Just clean warm sound. So far so good!                
Built in effects are cool...not listing the effects...not cool.
I get get that you can't give full control over every effect in such a small package...so you have 99 presets and something should take. Honestly, the reverb sounds pretty good. However, there is nothing in the manual about the effects...only something writtin on the board itself saying something to the effect of 1-16 reverb, 17-29 mod...etc
I would rather not play with 99 presets to find the sound I am looking for, I still have no idea if one of the effects is compression.
So the features seem nice...the instructions and usablility of them...so far, not so good.                
see above.
The mixer itself is really straight forward, the effects section, much less so.                
I won't know until I use it for a while, but it has a nice weight to it, and 'feels' well made.                
So far, its a great value!                
no idea...hopefully I won't find out either :)                
Its a mixing board...I guess its nice looking, but...its a mixing board.                
I would get another...great sound, small, and convenient.
Besides, once I finally figure out all 99 presets, I will be damned if I am NOT going to have it :)                
I use this mixer to sub-mix my keys, vocals (both dry and post Voicelive Touch), as well as my guitar and a monitor mix.  This provides a perfect 'more me' setup for my IEMs (output of mixer feeds a limiter box and then to my in-ears).  One of the biggest complaints for this mixer has been that the blue power LED used to be so bright on stage, it would blind you and you would have to cover it with tape.  Not any more, great news is that Behringer replaced it with a normal brightness orange LED.  The only other issue for me is aligning the power cord plug into the mixer body correctly on a dark stage without bending or breaking the pins in the cord plug.  I had to apply white electrical tape to the cord plug and make a 'sharpie' mark to indicate proper plug orientation.  Great mixer at a great price.                
Budget price budget sound!                
The FX is great,  The 100 FX are listed in an appendix to the manual which can be downloaded.                
Very intuative.                
No problems at this early stage.                
Nothing matches the bang for buck.                
Very helpful phone support before and after purchase.                
Looks and feels great!                
This will suit my limited needs for quite a while.  Where have i heard that before :-)                
This model is about to be discontinued for the USB one that will cost more.  So grab one while they last.  I needed extra mic and inputs for my Bose L1 Compact.  I now have studio quality effects on all channels.  You can find a sheet of the effects to print out  if you do some searching on line.                 
Purchaced this in 2010. Previously I was using a USA made Mackie 1202.
The Mackie lacked effects, it's only shortcoming.
The Behringer XENYX 1202FX Mixer is an amazing piece of gear.
My advice pertaining to Behringer gear in general is to HANDLE WITH CARE. 
The stuff is fragile. This one has been transported in a hard breifcase with enough room for all the hook ups and more.
This unit was produced in 2009 and is going on 6 years of regular use and running strong. I have set this baby up over 850+ times (one to four hrs).
I stopped using a bigger Behringer mixer in my band gigs because this one was always in my trunk and it worked for my single act and small band venues
So, it's all about protecting the sliders,knobs and that tricky power supply jack.
It even took a line in from another mixer,no problem.
If you can live in a 1/4 inch world check this out!!!
Can't beat it for the money, it's my second one, the first one was Non Fx. It handled so much just wonderfully! But the euro rack is better organized wire wise and worth the extra money. I will eventually upgrade to that one...it will be part of a rack box set up. I had trouble registering  product, but so cheap who cares, they want receipt uploaded...like it's really necessary. Power display  is meant to stay on, not broken.                
This mixer is the only one I've seen in it's class. Anything else at 100 bucks is a line mixer or something. This is actually gigworthy for a small band. Particularly if you have powered speakers! Then, your load in is easy, set up is easy, use is easy, tear down and leaving is easy. Sure beats the days of a rack of gear to do the same amount of work. It needs a power switch. But, the weaker point in the design is the input for power. It has very fragile pins and they are not marked well. If you don't line them up right, you will easily destroy the plug. I don't know why they couldn't use the same 'computer' plug everybody else has. I used white paint to mark teh arrow that shows the right way to insert the plug. At a gig, it can be dark...Anyway, that pretty blue light is too darned bright and can keep you from seeing the controls in a darker setting. Behringer has this light on many of their products and it is annoying. Over all, the mixer is very good. Fix those things and it would be excellent. I really don't have any experience with their support service, but it doesn't seem right to down grade them for having great stuff that doesn't breakdown.                
Solo acoustic sometimes duo.. perfect for an easy set up. Dial in your favorite reverb, set it & go. Light equipment. I am very careful with it since it could be delicate. Don't want to take the chances of finding out.                
Just plugged in this mixer and put it through its paces. The sound quality is really good. I have it hooked up to a Tapco 1400 power amp, so I've got plenty of headroom. (overkill?) My Takamine acoustic sounds full & rich, and vocals are clear & strong.Two criticisms: 1. The power cord uses a funky, small computer typ multi-pin connector that was a pain to get lined up & plugged in. Bad design decision.2. My unit contains built in effects with 99 pre-sets, but the unit comes with a manual and a catalog, and the listing of the effects is nowhere to be found. Will have to go online & hunt them down. Other than that, I'm very happy with the mixer.  *Have no experience with Behringer customer support, but they made me rate them!                
I now have two and use them with stand alone high power PA amps. They sound great. I have a bunch of Behringer gear and have never been let down.                 
This is a very good piece of equipment that should handle most of your needs for small and larger venues.  The build in FX processor really adds a great touch.  Don't know where your going to find another piece of equipment that does everything this will at this price.  The only improvement I would make would be to add sliders instead of knobs.                
Works perfect with my Bag Amp to put some effects on the vocals. Sounds great for little money.                
Mic pre-amps are silent. Effects work as advertised.  Sounds good for a tiny little mixer.  I was honestly surprised that the Behringer product sounded this good.                
It is simplistic, but extremely functional. The channel controls are not as fine-grained as a full-sized mixer but I didn't expect them to be. The phantom power is an 'all or nothing' deal for all XLR inputs, but that's fine with me. The built in effects are a real bonus. You need the included cheat sheet to know which effects you're dialing up, but I rarely change the setting, so it works for our band. There is no on/off power button that I can find, so I've resorted to using the power button the amp to prevent clunks and chunks. If it's plugged in...it's on.                
Really easy to use if you understand anything at all about sound. It's pretty intuitive and it does what it's supposed to. It's easy enough that I can adjust the mix in the middle of a rehearsal without putting down my bass.                
Seems solid. I've only been using it for a month, but no issues so far.                
Extremely high! For far less than $100, I have a small sized 12-channel mixer with the essential features that I need. I combined it with a 200W rack-mount amp and can run a monitor mix at rehearsals without breaking out the full-blown sound system.                
Haven't used.                
It's a mixer. It has lots of knobs and plugs and it has a pretty blue light and an LED number display and some of the LEDs blink on an off with signal. It's entertaining to small children. Seriously...the small size, plus included features are what sold me on the Xenyx 1202FX mixer.                
I bought this mixer as a 'rehearsal' mixer for our band. We run 4 vocal mics, rhythm guitar, and keyboard through it. There are plenty of inputs to run bass and lead guitar as well, we've just chosen not to.                
I am the owner of a number of Behringer products and most have been pretty good if not excellent in performance and price. I thought this would have been the same with the 1202 FX Mixer. When I received the unit yesterday I plugged it in and after 5 minuets the bottom panel gets very hot, There is no on/off switch so you have to unplug it to turn it on and off. It comes with a proprietary electrical cord and transformer giving very little forgiveness if you lose or misplace that somewhere. The design for ventilation on the unit is very poor, anything that runs that hot is not going to last very long. Called zZounds and they were very cordial but I did have to pay the shipping back and waste a lot of time going to Fed Ex and UPS and the shipping costs are 20% of the mixer. With all manufactures of musical instruments, never take anything for granted. Ask the retailer the dumbest questions and safe yourself some grief and time .If you cant test it out at the local music store or their are insufficient reviews on You Tube beware.                
Seems like a good little mixer EXCEPT I wasnt' aware that it was NOT powered . Make sure you have all supporting equipment before buying (POWER AMP)....then you'll be good to go. I'm rating it a 3 on sound simply because I was not aware that it could not be used as a direct plug in for shows and because it's not powered, it's quiet. Once properly connected to a powered source, I'm sure it will be fabulous.  SOLID make, GREAT quality of sound if using for studio work, and will be equally as great for shows once powered....(did I mention it's NOT powered?? LOL)                
Good quality sound. It respons very well. Im not sure yet how to utilize the special effecta since im only using it for karaoke.                
It does well for karaoke, i do not use it for a guitar.                
I really hate that it doe snot have a power switch. If i had known would have bought something different. I dont want the hassle of returning the item and waiting longer.                
No power switch. Dont understand the idea, or lack of.                
Yes, i would replace with something else.                
Behringer is a German base company. Fine engineering typical of the Germans. but made by a substandard Chinese manufacturer. The power jack is unlike anything I have ever seen. 3 tiny pins no longer than 3 millimeters and a Jack housing on the board that does not hold the jack plug securely. 4 times in the middle of recording the jack fell out on it's own. the very cheap Plastic Plug in chord has a life of it's own. Being barely pliable it is prone to reverting back to it's original wound state, which pulls the jack out of the board. the board itself is the cheapest plastic I think I've ever come across. I had to not only tape down the plugin jack but also tape down a barrier to keep the weight of my guitar cable from pulling it off the desk. this bottom has no rubber bumpers typical in most all electronic devices is made of the pre-molded body of the board and is very slick. I sent the first one back thinking it was just defective. The second board was no different and I sent it back too. Don't buy this board unless you are into the cheapest Chinese made product on the market.                
Praising what is good and what is not so good is MOOT. The power chord connection to the mixer is loose and sloppy and prone to loosing power if the power cable is even brushed by another cable. It is the worst power connection I've ever seen. 3 very tiny post that barely go deep enough for a  connection. I sent for a replacement and it was exactly the same. Behringer is from Germany and known for excellence in engineering and build. It is no longer made in Germany. Alas it is just another piece Chinese manufactured junk. If I were the head of Behringer I would be highly embarrassed to see the companies fine  products reduced to junk by the Chinese.                
I'm giving the sound 10 because there is no way even those "big" name mixers can approach this small baby! The mic preamps are simply sweet! It is even good to use it for recording...                
It has everything a small mixer needs. The effects are very good for live performance applications.                
No need to go to kindergarten to be able to use it!                
Strongly built! Although the older versions seem to be stronger, but it is perfectly good.                
I would pay double the price and still be very happy.                
Did not need them.                
Perfect high-quality compact mixer. Good for live and even recording. The preamps are sweet!                
Very good, clean sound with little noise. It's a great improvement from my old Behringer mixer.                
It has more than all other mixers in the price range, even some costing $100 more. The effects are clean and crisp, BUT, and this is why I'm giving it a 5, it doesn't have a ON/OFF switch! Come on Behringer, I'd pay $5 more for it! Need to unplug it every time I turn it off, which is pretty annoying.                
As easy as any other mixer                
Looks well built, very compact.                
Awesome value for my money                
Haven't tried to reach them                
I was a little worried about getting a set of mics for 40 buck, but once i received them i was impressed with the quality, and then I plugged them into my board at our church and WOW what a difference, everyone noticed how clear they sounded. I was so impressed i ordered another set. Highly recommend them.                
Our trio needed some mic fixing fast and CHEAP!!! I can't say enough about these mics. We thought we'd be tweaking for hours. Right away, we were pleasantly surprised. Within minutes, no "tweaky" feedback. I am using them in the studio and out in front at gigs and there great. Everybody knocks Behringher, people need to get a grip. 80% of our gig rig is and it's awesome stuff. People say we sound like the radio.                 
These mics are solid and well made. I have had em a few months to abuse and no beefs to report.                
Flexible for the most part....they were only $34 bucks. For this price I could not have made em doing for us what there doing????                
nicely made                
no                
it's a freakin mike....want sexy, go retro and blow a wadd                
For now, a nine as we have agreed to wear these out before we worry about some 58's.....think it's going to be a while?                
We bought these mics to replace cheap cordless mics that sounded horrible. These are much better but they will pick up any bump from the stage or mic stand. Have to use wind screens even at indoor events to cut back on the vocalist breath from being picked up by mic.                
The case and the mic holders are a plus.                
If you can hold it in front of your mouth you can use it. If your sound guy can plug it in to the right connection it works. Does not work when turned off (just picking on vocalist).                
Very durable                
We payed a little more than the price here would recommend them to anyone looking for mics on a budget. For live performance. But if you want to record spend the money to get better quality.                 
Hold it or put it on a stand (just kidding) have not needed any.                
The question here is sex appeal, but my daughter and a young man use these for ministry no sex appeal desired!                
We have already purchased better mics but keep these for back up. If we were not planning on recording these would have been fine for our needs. We lead worship for youth and small worship services and they work good giving a natural sound to the voice. My only complaint would be they have none or very little noise canceling properties and pick up a lot of excess noise in the area of the mics when left on.                
Found these mics to have very good sound quality. They have no prblem picking up multiple voice ranges. I'am using them in my home studio with a small PA system.                
Having 3 mics all the same makes it very easy to set EQ's and FX. Having a nice case aids in safe storage when not in use. All in all, I can't say anything negitive about these Behringer mics.                
Very easy to get good sound when mixing with other vocalists.                
These mics seem of good quality as do my other Behringer products, well made and if you need looks in a mic, these will fit the bill.                
Three vocal mics that sound this good,and are of Behringer quality, should last a long time in my application, and this price you can not beat!                
N/A                
Was making music without mics. Now we have fun hearing and recording with a little more volume and accent. Just adding to the enjoyment.                
I belive I'll get several years out of these mics and if that works out I'd buy them again. Oh' I'd buy them again even if their life span ends up shorter than mine.                
I got these mic's and was impressed with them. I don't know why, but everyone tries to compare mic's to SM-58's. These stand on their own. They've got a great sound. I recommend them to anyone looking for a good deal, on a budget. Good sound , low cost.                
great mic's and they are super cardiod, which is a plus in pro gear, and they are very sensitive does not take much volume on these to make them come through the mix,                  
I got these mic's for an upcoming play and needed some extra ones, so the price was right. Mic's sounded better then our more expensive ones. They sounded so go I am buying another set to replace our other mic's.
Like one reviewer noted the plug hookup is hard to make lock, but i think a different end on the cord might help on that. Or some good old electrical tape around the connection.                
I bought these mics because I wanted the case and clips for my 58s. I was actually surprised how good they sound. I said I was going to throw the mic away but I've actually used them. A couple times at my writers nights with great review on them. I covered the name up on the mics with electrical tape. Everyone assumed they were expensive mics. For less than $40 it's a no brainer buy them keep them as back up mics. I'll buy another 3 pack soon just to have around.                 
I have owed 10 or 12 of these things over the years. They are a great 'stop gap' affordable mic                
These mics work fine for PA system in church. They provide clear audio for those speaking. They were a very good value.                
Compared side by side to a 58, it performs admirably. The gain and off axis rejection are on par. It is definitely a bit more nasally and less smooth than the 58.                
The box and clips were surprisingly good quality. The switch, however, has a small design flaw. It is press fit into the switch hole (as on most mixers, etc). This becomes a problem if you are like me and gaff tape over the switch for some gigs, because removing the tape means pulling the switch handle out. Given, it presses back into place just fine, but it can become a hassle. Also, the center portion of the mic cannot be disassembled to bypass/repair the switch.                
Not nearly the weight of a 58, but still reasonably sturdy feeling. The ball and capsule appear surprisingly solid (the capsule itself has a metal grill over it in addition to the mic ball, impressive). The xlr jack is a bit of a tight fit and some cords have a hard time locking in place, but with some wiggling they will.                
This is one of those deals that shouldn't require too much thought. If you could use a few decent throw-away mics, get this kit.                
Meh, gaff tape over the Behringer logo and swear to the backup singers its a sennheiser.                
Keep these mics until you have the budget for some 58s.                
You cannot go wrong for $20.  I've bought microphones that were $500 that sounded much flatter and lifeless.  I record into 8 or 4 track recorders and process into a program like ableton live, so I tweak everything afterward.  Tweak it up, compress, eq  and this mic is awesome.  My voice is sultry so it sounds awesome.  My only beef was that Fed Ex delivered my package to my neighbor's house across the street.  Good thing I was home and saw that.  
Buy it.                
Look,
I read the reviews, listened to youtube clips, etc...I'm a lead vocalist in a hard rock cover band and needed a better microphone.Bottom line, Whether this mic is as good as an sm58 is irrelevent.This thing is under $30, if you feel the need to buy a name than by all means,spend $100 on an SM58.But, obviously your not wanting to spend a bunch of cash on a mic,or you wouldn't be reading this right now. lolneither was I.I mean come on,I'm not a multi-platinum musician, and neither are you.I play in a band, we play bars, I bought this mic and it does the job just fine.If you buy it you'll have no regrets,as I said, it's under $30 for petes sake...                
we have 3 of these along with three sm58's, and and a difference between the 2 brands can't be heard.  the shure is slightly hotter, but that is easily compensated for on the board.  xm8500 has a good hearty wheight in the hand,  very little to no  mic handling noise.  our church has used them live for well over a year, and i have even used to record drums (especially toms) and guitar with great results.  best part?  you can get 5 of these for the $$ of the other brand!!                
I'm a professional sound engineer with my own sound company. I bought one of these microphones on a whim, thought I would use it for a backup. I had sennhauser misc for vocals, then I tried this mic. It sounds great! From then on I use this mic for front vocals, it's that good. Many singers look at it, and I tell them to at least try it. Everyone that has tried it likes it, and are amazed it's a Beringer. I'm thinking of getting a few more, why not, I want to see what else I can use them for. I'm very happy with it.                
I bought this Mic frm zZounds a few months ago and it is an excelent buy. Great sound, no noise and is well made. The singer in my friends band uses it every gig and she love it, it really brings out the great quality of her vocals. All in all an excellent Mic for anyone whether you gig every week or just once in a while.. BUY IT :)                 
I bought this microphone on a whim. I thought for $20 what do I really have to lose if it's a lemon. I just got it today and I put it through the wringers. I'm not a fan of the Shure SM58 microphone. This microphone puts the SM58 to the curb. I never seen what the big deal was on the Shure SM58. I never caught the fever and didn't understand all the hype. If you're going to go with a Shure microphone go with the Beta 58A if you want to spring the money for one. But getting back to this Behringer microphone. I couldn't believe I was singing through a $20 microphone. It is incredible. Like I said I'd put it up against the overrated Shure SM58 any day of the week. All I can say is give it a try and I'm sure you'll be writing a review similar to mine. Try it. You'll like it.                 
If you are a real professional vocalist, musician or sound man, this mic will not suit your needs. This mic lacks the full, "warm" sound that I am used to when I use my EV or a Shure. Feedback and handling noise is a real problem with this mic. For the price I would recommend this mic for young kids still in the garage, but not for the serious stage.                
I love this mixer! As stated by others effects usage is probably the hardest part of the mixer to figure out, but hey that's what there YouTube channel is there for and it was a lot of help in that area. My primary use is for my weekly karaoke gig. And the sound I'm able to get using the parametric eq's to bring out the vocals for my singers. Every week my crowds are growing as my singers pass the word around. And I get great comments from the club owners and singers. My next purchase will be the xr18 just for the more advanced recording flexibility, the xr12 only does 2 channel stereo recording and I want to be able to tweak my singers recordings and I'll be able to do that with the xr18. And the built in wireless works great with no issues and has great range to sit in the back of the room to make adjustments with my iPad. I've been able to reduce the weight of my 10 space rack case system by 20lbs removing components because it's all built on the the xr12.                 
This has made my sound stand out. I used 4 Behringer CE500bk with this mixer. Im so impressed with what it did. It made 4 80 watt powered speakers sound like I had MORE then 4 80 watt powered speakers!! This has the dacs and audio processing that cleans the sound up nicely. And no noise. I used for speech and light background music. But after doing that I see I can do a lot more sound wise.
4 mic inputs with 4 pair of 1/4" plugs. 2 of which are low z for direct instrument hook up. the 4 mic inputs are phantom powered as well. Aux sends and all channels are completely assignable thru the software. iOS, Android Windows. All work with no problems. There are so many features I can't begin to go thru them all on this review.                
Only thing you will need to setup is router. I used a simple NetGear router ($21) and plugged the mixer into port 1 on router. set up my own personal wireless network that only my iPad sees.                 
Its built well. You can put this unit under the table (not on the floor or ground) and just have the router on the table top, with the computer, tablet or phone running your controls. It has rack ears as well and rubberized sides. Also has handles.                
Its a win. All tech that do sound must get one.                
Didn't need it                
IM still finding out more about it.                
Overall, this mixer has everything you would need and some.                
This mixer makes everything sound better. It has so many features I'm still finding stuff everyday. Like other reviews have said, manuals are not helpful for features. 
I used this mixer with 4 Behringer CE500bk and 3 audio Technica mics and an iPad for back ground music. Just that alone was enough for close to 300 ppl to hear announcements and music. 
The effects are controlled via the iPad. The features with the iPad, Android or Windows are just amazing. You have so much control over your sound. You have full rack equipment all in your tablet ( maximizers, compressors, reverb, stereo exciters and many more) for total control over your sound. The software is stable and doesn't crash. 
I set mine up with a simple netgear router with the Ethernet cable plugged into "1" slot on router to the Ethernet on the mixer. I left the mixer under the table and all cables under the table. Only things on top the table is the iPads and router. And that's the setup. At home I found use for it in my  desk recording studio setup. It bring my music out full and up front. 
Behringer has made an excellent product yet again.                 
I've been a sound guy, singer, musician for a long time and the flexibility this little piece of equipment gives me and my band is unlike anything I've seen come along in regards to mixing. The quality of the sound is spot on, quiet, and responsive. I am nor experiencing any latency at all! It has all of the tools of the large digital boards, but without having to run a snake to a sound table that you had to either find a hole to set up or move a few people in the audience to set up....now I can sit right in the middle of them only taking up my seat and do all the mixing and fine tuning I need to do for whomever I'm mixing for! Only downfall is learning fx...a little tricky. And....all this for $299? Crazy!                 
I've been using this mixer for 6 months now and I have been impressed with it's ease of use and features that are included.  I've been a DJ/Karaoke host for 20+ years and this is the best mixer I have ever owned.  I'm able to bring out the singers voice with parametric eq's and ring out the speakers from the main mix.  I have every possible effect if could need for any situation.   and the price point is the best feature of all.  i've been able to remove 4 other pieces of equipment from my rack case because this mixer has every thing built into the software that I was using.   external eq's, reverb/delay, compressors.   I've dropped at 10 LBS out of my rack.  and packing in & out on a nightly basis this mixer has made things a lot easier on the back.                
First things first:  the mixer sounds good and it's easy to use.  Wi Fi works well and the unit is made well enough to last, if you treat it properly (as with any piece of equipment) - The things I would like changed (they could be via firmware and software updates) are:  
1) as it stands INSERT EFX take a spot from the SEND effects.  That's a limitation because the inserts effect should be a separate entity from the send effects.  Processing power should not be an issue nowadays when you have phones that can do amazing things.  Seems Behringer is stripping down the unit for no reason.
2)  The USB playback does NOT read mp3! If you want to play music on breaks and/or use some backing tracks you will have to do everything in WAV, the ONLY supported format. Again, totally unnecessary limitation and a short sighted one.
3)  You can use the 31 band EQ on STEREO out and BUSSES only - if you want to take care of problematic feedback on individual channels using the 31 band eq...you can't.
4) on the subject of feedback: why not add an automatic, real time feedback process since Behringer already has it in other units? They already have the software. OF course, you can tune the room before but, that's not always possible on smaller gigs, especially when people are already there. No one wants to listen to you "ringing" the speakers.
5)  Would have been nice to have an additional STEREO out with an analog volume control. There is a phone out but, would be nice to have another out for monitoring the live mix with a set of speakers in certain situations.
Those are my wish list changes. The mixer does sound good and it's super easy to use. Some the UI could be improved and surely they will continue to issue new updates to both firmware and software.  
Their support is non-existent as is the documentation. The Wiki page is useless for the most part and their forums seem to be taken over by "know-it-all" users that look down upon features request making it useless to post there. I hope Behringer addresses those issues. I think in an effort to cut down on their customer service expenses they have actually created an endless (and useless) loop of Wiki Page, links that are wrong, lacking documentation and hostile forums.                
It sounds beautiful.  clean and clear, with no hum present.  the sound control is crazy.  My guitarist plugged direct in and through all the FX options was able to model his desired amp tone, as well as all the pedals he used.  If you are a minimal pedal fiend, the four channels within the single guitar channel are enough.  If you are an effects fanatic, you can use the fx loop option and run it before or after.  The control over your sound is just plain nuts.  It carries effects for each of the 16 channels, you can set up memory presets and switch your sound for individual parts of each song in your set lists, which your sound guy can change or roadie, if you are lucky enough to have one.                
Want to record into a computer for an album? check.  Want to run and charge your iPhone while you are on a break? check.  I listed the features per channel in the sound section.  Have an Android phone?  You can run your mix.  Have an iPhone?  Get an iPad.  This is my only gripe, and its not much of one.  You can operate from an Android phone, but not an iPhone.                
Once you download the ap, you can get started right away.  I wish Behringer had included a little further instruction.  There are so many functions and so much capability of this system, I'm sure the book would weigh 20lbs.  There also is not much I could find on the Behringer website.  I will continue to look.  However, just playing around with the system, finding new features and options are easy and take a little trial and error in some areas, but everything is easy to work through and you can always find your way home and undo any mistakes.  This ting is genius...just wish there were more instructions.                
So far so good.  I addressed this in the review section.                
What you get for the price is insane.                
More instructions would be nice, but I repeat myself.  You can find your way through, and I would guess that's as good a way to learn as any.                  
I am completely blown away...did I mention all this music mix goodness only weighs 8lbs?  Hooray for easier load in and out.  We lost 90lbs by switching to this system and leaving the Peavey board at home.                
This mixer is so much more than I expected, especially for the price.  Everything will be detailed further in the review, and there's a lot of it.  They do not do justice to the features and capability on the product description...or the box it comes in for that matter.  The features on this mixer put it up there with most of your high-end mixers like Prosonus and the ilk.  As time goes by, the only thing I will be watching the durability and built quality, as with all things.  But comparatively, even if it breaks, I can replace it four times and still not equal the price of the major name mixers, so I'm not really that concerned.  I will continue to update.                
I love this thing! It's a little noisy but not bad for live applications. My only complaint is the manual is only available on wiki. I'd rather have something I can download and keep with me. This mixer is not for the novice; it has a lot of great features I haven't even begun to try yet.                 
What a great value in a digital mixer. I don't know how Behringer continues to crank out such HQ stuff at these prices but I'm thankful they do. My only complaint is that the USB is not a bi-directional audio I/O.  Seems like they could've easily implemented an audio interface via USB.                
By far my best investment in musical equipment ever!  Easy to use, easy to save rooms, easy to setup, easy to take down!                 
the purchase and I arrived on a Wednesday and Friday and the use did not have any kind of problem, The EQ and the Efx are very good                
Just purchased my second XR16 and could not be more happy. The unit arrived promptly and in fresh, sealed packaging. This mixer is a complete game changer for the small live video production arena. It's built solidly with high quality connectors and a practical 3RU space requirement. I strongly urge any purchaser considering using a tablet computer to use the Android app rather than the IOS application. I read a review by someone who said the Android app was a better interface and that is true, in fact it's brilliant. The MacOS application is also superb and works perfectly. My only warning is if you choose to rackmount the device you should use locktite or lockwashers on the screws holding the rack-wings. The screws will back-out if you travel the gear on any commercial jet.                
I'm not really happy with the Behringer X16 for several reasons. When I ordered it, it was defective (no power) I since replaced and notice that the wifi antenna is very fragile. The instruction manual is not helpful at all. I find myself going to YouTube quite often because the Behringer staff doesn't seem to cover the basic troubleshooting needed for new users.                
Mixer works great when its working. But can become a nightmare when it's not. When I first bought it, I tested and played with all its features. However, I used it at an ideal gig education was a short theatre performance. I could not link the mixer to 3 different devices and the customer was on my butt. I ended up grabbing an analog console. Customer lost, Lesson learned.

The Midas preamps in this board are excellent. Our friends, fans and even club owners have commented about the improvement sound, particularly complimenting the clarity of our vocals - none of them knowing that we have changed out equipment. The intelligibility and cohesion of our mix is noticeably improved.                 
The most obviously useful feature here is the built-in WiFi that will support up to 4 devices at once. I use a 10" Samsung tablet for a mixer view, and an additional smaller tablet to keep the FX window available for tempo tapping. My guitarist uses his droid phone to mix monitors. We've never had a signal dropout.
The RTA built-in to the graphic EQ on every output has afforded me the best monitor mixes we have ever had. All of the audio processing in this mixer are outstanding.                 
There is a learning curve with this board, however it is pretty easy to get a great sound. One must remember that the user has to tell this board how you want your signal routed, i spent a couple of tense moments on night #1 before I noticed that I had not yet specified that the software Buss 1 had to be routed to the physical Aux 1 in the app.                 
I am impressed with the build quality. The jacks and switch are of good quality. The WiFi antenna seems like it might be a little bit vulnerable, but nothing makes me question how long this mixer will last. Seems pretty tough.                 
I think this mixer is a real sleeper - a small device with huge performance. I have had zero buyer's remorse and would gladly buy another one.                 
There is quite a bit of user info sharing on the web, whereas Behringer doesn't offer much in-depth instruction or support. I didn't really need it, and I doubt you would either.                
Huge wow factor here with the wireless mixing!                
I am very impressed with this mixer. I perform 2-3 times per week with my 4-piece rock band and primarily wanted to downsize some of our bulky PA gear. I did not expect the quantity and quality of outstanding features that the XR18 offers and delivers on. The networking and WiFi aspects were a little intimidating before I opened the box but have proven to be flawless. I had planned on giving myself a week to become acclimated to this mixer before taking it on a gig - I ended up using it and getting great results the same night that it arrived. We have now used the XR18 on at least 20 gigs and I am completely pleased and totally impressed.                
Out of the box the unit was very intuitive and easy to use for me, an old school analog type. After one practice we used the mixer for a gig with the iPad Ap.  Every thing worked great. Our sound guy had his own iPad and we had one on stage to tweak monitors as needed. Based on reading and watching several tutorial videos, It does appear that the Android Ap is more robust, and we will give that a try eventually.  I would recommend looking up some videos and sorting through them for new ideas and applications.  Overall very satisfied with the unit and with zZouns with this my second purchase from them.                
Our band has been using the XR18 for 8 months (or so). Set up in small venues is great; no hassling with a snake and mixers, just put the box on the stage, plug in and do all the mixing from a tablet.
Issues we've had has been related to adapting to the mixer applications. Each different device (iPad, Android, Windows) are programmed slightly different. They are laid out differently and may have features that aren't found between apps. For instance, mixing just for monitors in a bus output to the stage; I set an Android device in front of the guitar player - the Android app allows you to select and show only the faders for a given output (such as bus1). This allows the guitar player to dial in his own mix without accidently changing the main mix. 
I am the keyboard player and bought one for personal use with my DAW. Through USB, it is possible to record 16 channels straight to audio channels in the DAW. I have yet to try this out, but it seems pretty straight-forward. In the meantime, I've been bringing it to our practice and working with the others in the band to show them the capabilities it has. We've been experimenting with the effects; there are so many things to choose from. It makes sense that the musicians get to know how this thing works. Our sound man has encouraged us to work with this thing so we all have an easier time when it comes to setting up and performing.                
I haven't had a chance to A/B the pre's on this with any other unit, but I will say that they sound good.                
Where do I even start? This thing will replace an entire refrigerator rack full of gear. The 6 buses are great for monitor mixes. Being able to record live performances on the track level is absolutely amazing (I would recommend checking out TracksLIVE for recording). Having EQ/Comp/Gate settings on each channel is great. I haven't really dug into the FX yet, but what little I've heard sounded good.                
There IS a learning curve to this unit and if you're not familiar with the basics of technology I could see you having a difficult time initially. HOWEVER, it's definitely worth spending the time familiarizing yourself because once you get the hang of it it will make running sound infinitely easier in the long run.                
The unit build itself seems to be quality. It comes with rack ears and once installed it sits solid in the rack. The Combo jacks seem like they will stand up to years of use.                
Amazing value. Like I mentioned before it has already saved me approx $500 on In ear monitors, and it will also save you time and money by replacing tons of outboard gear you no longer have to haul around.                
I haven't dealt directly with support, but they do have a product forum in which they are active. There are facebook groups for the XR series and I see company reps answering questions in there quite a bit. Also, Their dev dept seems to be on the ball with frequent firmware updates and application updates.                
Digital mixers such as this one are game changers. For me the HUGE wow factor here is being able to run your monitor mix from a phone. Everyone knows a bad monitor mix can derail and entire show, now there are no more excuses. Also being able to track your live performances w/o any additional hardware (other than a laptop) is amazing.                
For many years I wouldn't even allow anything with the name "Behringer" into my signal chain. But when i saw the XR18 and all of the features it promised I had to check it out. I've had it for a few months now and mainly use it for band rehearsal with in ear monitor mixes. First and foremost, the unit almost immediately paid for itself with it's headphone output. You can assign the headphone source to just about anything, so in our case we assigned it to BUS5 and use it as a monitor mix for our drummer. This not only saved us from having to spend $500 on ANOTHER IEM pack, but he also gets his own dedicated monitor mix.I've read other reviews where people complain about the built in wifi cutting out but I haven't had any issues with it. However, the 2.4ghz spectrum (wifi) can get pretty crowded in some areas, and this can cause problems with ANY wireless device so if you plan to gig with this unit I would always be prepared to run hardwired to a laptop in a worst case scenario.There are currently applications released for Windows/OSX android & Ipad, but it's my understanding that an iphone app is still under development. Don't let the lack of an iphone app hold you back though. I use a cheapo $40 android tablet to control my XR18 and it works great. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase. The bang for your buck factor here is extremely high.                
I purchased this about a month ago and, given all the features it has and the low price, I was a bit skeptical that it would deliver. How wrong I was !  We have been using it for all our gigs and it has proved to be the best investment I've ever made. We all run in-ear monitors from a separate bus so, everyone has his own personal mix. Each guy has the app on a phone or, tablet and, can tailor his own monitor mix to suit his taste. FOH could not be easier as you can walk around the club and get the mix perfectly set. The lack of running snakes, carrying equipment racks, and wedges cut our setup time dramatically ( And made it easier on our backs)  We are a 5 piece Country, Rock, R&B band and, this mixer is a must-have for any gigging band.                
We just replaced half of our sound system with this thing. Small live venue we replaced our snake, Mackie 24.4 and all our rack gear. If you properly set up the gain staging this thing is awesome in a live setting, the mic pre's are clear, the built in dynamics work amazingly well. We just purchased 3 Kindle fires to run the xair Q app so monitors can be run from the stage. speaking of monitors the graphic eq with built in rta made ringing out the monitors so easy, I was able to do it myself from the stage. Built in effects are not bad either                
I work at a night club 7 days a week I use this 7 days a week. I have famous Mexican bands come in and some bring their engineer some bring expensive gear. I have out beat them with this. People have ask me to teach them the come in with yamahas tf5 and the have years ahead of me. I have a secret I play 7 instruments and heir it all. This is all you need and pride. Has all you need good fx and echo compression gate. Bottom line what els you want?? Something that does the work for you? Then don't call your self an engineer                
My only regret is not buying one sooner. 
Do your homework. Watch as many videos as possible. It's easy to get a solid mix in a short time. This unit eliminated two racks of gear. The endless effects (up to 4 per channel), 6 aux sends (I use one for subs), and an affordable price tag. We've used it for months, and no hiccups at all. If you're looking for an affordable digital mixer, this is the one.                
I have had this for over two weeks and have used it on about 8 gigs so far. The more I use it the better it gets. Highly tweakable! Sounds awesome!!! Only downside is the different app interfaces between the different platforms. I have familiarized myself with them all pretty good so it isn't that much of a pain to deal with now.                
Lots to like about this mixer - small footprint, extra line inputs (17,18), easy to use, apps are pretty easy to navigate.  It has two glaring flaws and they're both related to the built in WiFi.  
First, 802.11g is an old protocol and for looking at screen redraws, it's slow and laggy.  If more than one device is connected, it can take 3-5 seconds to register a fader move.  That's useless in a live situation.  
Second, the encryption options are Open, which no one should do, or WEP, which was cracked more than a decade ago.  
Since wireless IS the interface of this mixer, you should expect to add $100 or more to the cost for a good, but small wireless router to keep in your gear bag.  It's a huge overlook that was clearly driven by marketing to say wireless was built in.  Mackie is coming out with a similar mixer, and hopefully it doesn't fail here too.                  
Just purchased and am using it with Logic Pro X. The way it has increased my efficiency and workflow is mind-blowing. And the best part is it actually works! I didn't rate manufacturer because I haven't used them.                
This is a great controller for the price. But, I use Pro Tools primarily, so the device is limited by HUI limitations. So, in Pro Tools the master fader (9th) is inoperative. Most people are aware of this HUI limitation already. But another HUI limitation is that the scribble strips are not in full color, just black/gray backlit.Having said that, the scribble strips are impossible to read unless you're right on top of the surface, literally. I have to mix standing over the unit in order to see the strips. Other than that, it's great, I plan to buy another for 16 channel control.                
If you are a Logic Pro user this thing is awesome. in fact i am starting to think they created the X-Touch primarily for Logic. It was easy to set up and all the buttons work as they are supposed to. In my opinion, Behringer hit a home run with this one. for the price you are not going to find a better controller for Logic Pro.I also use Pro Tools and Digital Performer. With these, the X-touch works, but there is less functionality. The faders, pan and transport all work fine but not all the special function buttons. I am hoping in future updates this will be fixed. but since logic is my primary DAW, i am thrilled with the X-Touch                
I use this with Presonus studio one. This is really a surface controller for Logic so you won't get a lot of the bells and whistles if you use it with anything but. It's really limited with Pro-Tools. I use it in conjunction with a Xtouch compact and they both work flawlessly together. Again, this was really designed for Logic but it suits my needs for what I use it for.                
this controller worked instantly and perfectly with my software (reaper, harrision mixbus, tracktion). it does everything as advertised and the fader noise isn't noticeable to me when i'm using to mix. 
my only real compliant is that it is a bit bigger then i'd like. it's sorta boxy and feels a little oversized. mostly it's too tall and a bit bulky / chunky. on the plus side it feels very sturdy. 
when i received it noticed it was used. it appears i was sent accidentally sent a refurbished unit instead of a new one. 
i contact zZounds and they were super helpful. they offered a full refund / return or exchange at no cost to me. they also offered me a generous partial refund. i went with the partial refund and kept the unit, because it works perfectly and does exactly what i thought it would do. 
also, i tried to register it with behringer so i could claim my free tracktion 7 daw software download code. i contacted behringer several times and they never responded to give me my warranty registration infor or my download code. not a big deal but i was hoping to get the tracktion software as advertised.                 
I never review products, but this one is worth taking the time. Excellent Stuff! I am very meticulous and precise when it comes to setting up my guitars. Tuning inconsistencies bug the hell out of me. Even with good locking tuners and a Graphtech nut, the tuning stability of my Wilkinson tremolo was alway a little erratic. Adding just a tiny bit to each nut slot during string changes makes my Tremolo action and tuning smooth and stable.                
I have 6 guitars of which one is a Gibson Led Paul. Gibson guitars can be difficult to keep in tune due to the angle of the neck and string nut pressure ratio. I've used the product on my Gibson & other guitars and found it to be useful in keeping my stringed instruments in tune. I can attest that it does a great job and I have found no better performing product currently on the market. Want to keep your guitar in tune with minimal clean up after application? This will do the job for you. Thanks zZounds for your outstanding service!                
Use this stuff at every string change on all contact points. It would probably be best used on the nut and protect it from wear. Would recommend this stuff to buy.                
Clear, penetrating, full sound, with a  pitch range that inspires experimentation with new sounds.                
Videos are good, expecially because a theremin is an instrument that most will have to learn without a teacher.                
It is made well, although since I do not travel with the instrument, I cannot attest to its ruggedness when disassembled and reassembled on a regular basis.                
It is what you have to pay in order to get a good theremin, so it is worth the price.                
Moog music ws very helpful when contacted. They took an interest in my problem, which was one related to tuning the instrument when tuning was beyond the capacity of the external controls.                 
 A theremin is an instrument that always amazes those who hear it. This is not so with, say, a piano, guitar or drumset. Sometimes the theremin seems more interesting than the performer.                
When I bought it, it was considered to be the one to buy... maybe not the most expensive, but a serious instrument. Now, whenever there is a better instrument out, I will want it.                 
Theremins have different sounds. Other review statements notwithstanding, this is neither the only theremin on the market, nor the least expensive. Bob Moog was most instrumental (pun gently intended) in bringing the theremin back to public consciousness, and the Etherwave models are quite playable, though non-linear in pitch response. What distinguishes them from others is the more brass-like sound. Others (soundslikeburns, for instance) have the more string/vocal sonority. It's all about preference.                
Quite good. There are two knobs that, when used together, allow some slight changes in tonality. Subtle but there. I love the 3/8" rod antennae. They look substantial and are attractive. The instrument can be ordered from various sources in a variety of finishes, including black, white, and several wood stain colors.                 
Theremin is not an easy instrument to play, but it's a serious one. Expect it to take practice. Avail yourself of some of the online lessons on YouTube by Thomas Grillo. Peter Pringle and Moog offer instructional DVDs. Many theremin players are self-taught. Don't kid yourself, be patient and prepared to suck while you learn the ropes. No frets, no keys, nothing to guide you but sense memory and practice, practice, practice.                 
The build seems excellent to me. Most Moog products throughout the company's history have been built with pride and passion.                 
One might wish they were still making the Etherwave Pro. It had a more linear response, and looked really cool. Lots of people are playing them on YouTube. But it's history, and used ones are commanding in the $6000 range! For the price, if you like the brass-like sonority (I didn't, preferring the more string-like or vocal sound of the B3) it's a complete winner at this price. But a good, playable unit can be had for half this.                
I haven't used it personally, but Moog support is fabled.                 
Like every Moog product, it does what it does with sturdiness, style, elegance and that Moog charm we've known since the '70''s. The  Moog legacy is being carried on proudly, though the world is poorer for the loss of Dr. Bob.                
From what I understand, people keep these for a long time. Why not? Sturdy build, attractive unit, good performance for the price.                 
The sound can't quite compare to the original theremins, but it is still excellent. Very tweakable.                
The theremin does not come with it's stand, but the knobs are very useful.                
Do not buy this thinking it will be easy to play. It is extremely difficult if you actually want to play. Sound effects are simple to produce, but true music takes dedicated practice.                
Although this is the only theremin on the market as of now, I do believe were there another one it could not be any better in construction.                
This can turn any concert into a magic show. It can mesmerize your audiences.                 
This instrument will stay with me hopefully for the rest of my life. Do not get this without getting a stand, and be prepared to suck at playing for a few weeks. When the playing is good however, it's a beautiful thing.                 
I think it sounds wonderful, like something between a trumpet, a human voice and a radio being tuned. amazing!                
I don't know, as I dont have one, though I would like to.                
Already owning the 1st gen of this pre, I knew it was good! The 1st gen is so thick and big sounding along side of being very smooth. Really smoothing out the "s" sound compared to other pres. I recently bought a UA 710 $800 pre and the 1st gen BLA stomped that one in the ground and at only $350. both Ua 710 and BLA had heavy hiss at high gains More so with the 710 and the BLA only had 30db gain. So returned the 710 and got this new BLA B12a Mk II and YAY! Sounds so good just like the first gen and with this one we have 50db gain along with barely any hiss even at maxed out gain! Black Lion Audio really know what they are doing and they charge less for more compared to UA where we pay for the name as well.                
This clock is by far the best possible upgrade one could make to their studio for under  $5000, and it only costs 1/5 of that! I have heard other clocks ten times the price, that although did likewise bring an absolute and undeniable improvement,  the improvement was not as drastic as with this BLA mk3, nor was it as easily affordable. This company is really doing something right and I don't know how long they've been around or how long they can keep this up, but I hope they do because their products are changing the game for small studios where every dollar must be wisely invested to maximize sonic improvements and keep us relevant in this competitive market.                
I usually wouldn't blink when thinking of an amp to buy and skip Blackstar without thought, but This amp is different.  They build a dual channel amp that stays really clean on Channel A but Channel B Goes easily to the end of breakup.  This is definitely a pedal platform and a well designed version at that.  There is more than enough volume for any gigs I do these day.. all of which has big PA systems and in ear monitors. Though this is a total curveball by Blackstar, it is a refreshing change. In an odd way, it reminds me of the Fender Deville, Michael Landua. which it two channel of clean... You get more power amp distortion due to the lower output wattage., which I think adds to the palate of tone you can get with this amp.                 
I play electric guitar weekly for my church which meets in an older, brick style room with minimal sound engineering thought out into it. We're also playing monitorless and without an amp room. Right off the bat, the odds are NOT in my favor. ***note - I'm running a Squier VM '72 tele thinline into an always on MXR custom comp with the volume at noon and sustain all the way down (because church volumes)***My goal for an amp is something that can sound decent at the (lack of) volume which I play at. I was really excited for this amp due to the versatility it boasts and all the reviews of it online. I loved the idea of different voicings for the channels and I couldn't wait to try the ISF knob. These were what I was excited for most when I bought it. Features: Channel one isn't for me. I don't know if it's because I can't cook the tubes, but it never sounds full. Think AM radio. The ISF is really interesting because it. It only changes the sound, but also the range of the BMT controls. The Bass gets boomy-er on the UK side, and the Mids are more responsive on the US side. I do like the reverb. I tend to keep it below 10 o'clock for a little space. I've got pedals for the absurd stuff. I haven't tested out the emulated output yet since all of our di's are in use.Quality: I don't know if mine is faulty, or if it needs to be retubed (damaged in transit?), but there's a constant hiss even when everything is turned down including the master volume. It gets covered by normal amp hiss the louder you turn up, but at bedtime levels, it's louder than your guitar. At daytime apartment levels, it's still prominent when you're not playing, but not louder than the guitar (think metal players without a noise gate). My iOS db meter clocks it at ~60 db.Sound: I decided to go with 3.5 stars because I did find a sound that I like so far (we've been playing as a 3 piece so far, we'll have 2 keyboardists join us this week). So far, Ive found that channel 1 doesn't work for me (at least at these volumes) and the UK side hides in my mix. Even a Sparkle Drive couldn't pick me back up. However, I decided to test the US side before I traded this amp in for something else and I'm glad I did! It's in your face, in the good way! Like I've mentioned, the bass is tight and the mids are more present. This definitely helps to cut through the mix. It sounded great this past week with only bass and drums, we'll see if it holds up this week when we have 2 keyboardists join us. So far, I like it. Time will tell if I end up trading it in for a fender if I'm only using it for fender tones anyways.Ease of Use: here's where it gets tricky. The controls seem easy enough, but the ISF totally changes the voicing of the tone controls for channel 2. When I turn the ISF, I always have to tweak the bass and mids.Value: Me, I might have gone either with an ac15, blues jr or even a hot rod deluxe. All of which are cheaper than this. However, I would still like to try this with the tubes cooking, possibly with an attenuator.The Wow Factor: I'm not able to play at loud volumes, but I was hoping for something versatile that sounds good at lower to moderate levels. That is not this amp. It's also a little noisy when there's no signal, so this definitely wouldn't have been my choice for church where there's a lot of downtime between sets.                
First off, I love black stars features and the love they put into there products. When I received mine visual everything was pleasing to look at. Features wise, it had everything I needed for the music I play (effects loop, 2 channels, etc). The sound however I would describe it as warm and farty when cranked. Maybe I got defect on the isf controls but no matter how much I played with the tone, I could never get a clear bright clean tone. I was just gonna wait it out till I could have a replacement but instead I returned it and went with a voxac30c2x.                 
Just got this last week and absolutely love it........can't wait to get the 5 button footswitch which will essentially make this a 6 channel amp with 3 channels and a boost for all of them.......zZounds staff was great and very patient with me as I first ordered a fender hot rod deluxe which had a problem......then a marshall dsl 40 combo that I just didn't care for the sound.........good amp just not the sound I was looking for then a marshall origin 20 combo.....sounded great but not enough power.......all good amps just not what I was looking for......then I got this and everything I wanted was there.......cleans that are amazing and the overdrives are some of the finest I've ever heard........and the reverb is quite nice and very useable unlike many amps I've played........plus the 12 monthly payments makes this quite affordable and in my budget.........many thanks to Blackstar and zZounds for making me sounds as good as I can........oh yea........buy one of these you'll love it......have not needed tech support but assuming it will be great too                
I was looking for an all in one amp for home use and gigs. I live in an apartment so I can't afford to be loud all the time. The 4 watt mode tames the amp very nicely. It can get plenty of saturation at volumes lower than the tv. The clean channel is just that. Clean. It is on par with my Peavey classic 30. The gain channel can be shaped to sound any way you like. I would recommend this amp for any style of player. The reverb isn't going to blow you away but I always prefer pedals to onboard fx.                 
I have been a Blackstar amp owner and guitar player for 40+ years.  This amp has what it takes to be a front runner whether playing at home or gigging out.  The cleans are crystal clear and the the OD channel is absolutely amazing.  With the voicing switch, it allows you to put a little dirt in the clean channel and makes the OD channel come alive.  Blackstar hit the nail on the head with this series of amps.  I highly recommend you purchase one....you won't regret it....                
Well it ain't going to set the world on fire with volume. BUT it is plenty loud for it's intended use. it is perfect for jamming along with your computer, DVDs, MP3s. It's cute. Delay is very good. Gain is good and not cheap or tinny. I got it for desktop use to play along with lick lessons. No need to plug in a big amp. This little guy has really nice clean to grit tone without blowing the windows out. Especially for blues. It cleans up rolling the volume back like a big amp. And it seems to be pick sensitive. Don't worry about the little speaker fizzing out. It would be great for traveling and playing in a hotel room. It could get loud enough to annoy neighbors in a hotel room.It does sound like a full size amp and it is very addicting to play. At some time I may spring for the extension speaker but for now it is perfect.                
This box sounds good for what it is. Way better than those other minis. Watch the shoot out on you tube. Clean and overdrive and delay all sound good. I have a blast with it and dont have to fire up my stack or other large amps. I leave it on my bar and when i want to practice just plug in and turn it on. I actually play more now since its so handy. I haven't had to use manufacturers support.                
It works great for rehearsing and accompanying acoustic guitars. It's bigger than I thought it would be which is a good thing because from the pictures I thought it would fall over with a cord plugged in. It doesn't! It just sits there and busts out great sound. Oh, and zZounds made the deal easy.                
Amp is very light duty. I feel like I might blow the Speaker. Good for jamming tunes but not so good for Bass. I would spend the extra and get a Roland Bass cube .                
Love this little amp.
Sounds great.
The clean channel has a bit better sound than the OD channel.
There are plenty of demos on YouTube to hear for yourself.
The mini stack comes in a box. Blackstar doesn't make a carry case for the 2 speakers, which would have been nice.
Who wants to carry their portable amp around in a box?
Not me.
Fortunately I was able to find a nice case on Amazon.
The speakers fit perfectly in the bag. There are also side pockets which hold the power cord very nicely.
The seller is eCost Connection, and the bag is listed as "large digital camera/video padded carry bag".
I have absolutely no relationship with this bag company. Just trying to help out my fellow Blackstar amp lovers.
I've owned this amp for over a year now, and I still play it everyday. It's such a great amp. I get the same feeling I got when I plugged it in for the first time every time I play it. It's tone is excellent. It breaks up super easy, and it man oh man, it is LOUD! I wasn't expecting a 1watt amp to be this loud. And like most tube amps, it sounds best cranked to 11. It's basically a one channel amp with an overdrive switch. Without the overdrive engaged, it still breaks up full on AC/DC with the gain on.. You have to roll the gain almost all the way off and the volume about halfway to get even close to a clean tone. Then press the overdrive switch and it's full on tube madness. The ISF is the only thing I don't like about it. It really limits it considering that's all you have EQ wise. I keep mine set all the way to the left (USA.) I think the the British side is wayyyy too mid-y. But it still sounds great at least all the way to the left IMO. I buy, sell, and trade a LOT of gear, and this amp is one I've never considered letting go of.                
This product the HT1 Blackstar combo amp performs exactly as they advertised.  I have found that it lacked a little volume, but my YJM footpedal interacts real well with the amp..  the american and british settings do represent well their respective sounds.  I really love the headphone jack; the extension speaker output is cool to have.  I feel the HT1 is a little pricey for its overall size, but it sounds great when combined with something else. It plays best when practicing with headphones, but can easily be used in a coffee shop setting or combined with an extension speaker.  I got what I was wanting_ great tone, no digital effects, practice ready and highly recordable.                
See above                
Just turn the knob left to righbt to mix american or breitish sounds has a gain switch.                
Built like a bigger amp; tubes are high end.  No problems with casinf.                
Great quality but expensive                
No                 
This was a necessary move for me as I only havwe a 2x12 which is loouud.                  
I have already gotten massive use of the HT1 and love the quality of the sound I get, especially my S series Ibanez with a tone Zone in the brifge.  It sounds like 80s metal.                
i own the ht5cr and it is simply steller. reading rave reviews about the ht1, i bought it.
my ht1 is pure fizz if you crank the gain on the clean channel. the videos sound just wonderful cranking the clean. my od channel is shrill and totally non musical. i replaced both tubes and took SOME of the shrillness out of the od channel. i installed a celestion super 8 speaker and the od channel is pure hot rod marshall now. the cranked clean still pure fizz. you shouldnt have to retube/respeaker a new amp to make it sound useable.                
This is basically a great sounding tube amp in a small size. Tube amps sound best cranked up. However, cranked up amps are not always the best for practicing and recording. And when I say practicing, I do not mean rehearsing. 
This amp can get loud (to give you great tube tone) but not terribly loud because it is only 1 watt with an 8 inch speaker. You can get fantastic cleans, crunch classic rock and some good metal tones as well. 
The "ISF" is very cool and you can change the overall character of the amp from a Fender-esque clean sound to a Vox chime to a roaring woody Marshall-esque sound. 
The reverb on the amp is digital and stereo. In reality, it sounds great and is very usable. It feels and sounds like a quality analog reverb.
 If you are looking for touch responsiveness, tube breakup (all levels), etc. this is a great amp and is very small and portable. Takes pedals well, but I have enjoyed using it without pedals for the most part. It is a high resolution amp, so if you play well, it sounds great. If you make mistakes, it will draw attention to them unlike some other amps. 
Punchiness, touch, all the tube hallmarks are here. My new favorite amp, sound-wise, for recording and practice. 
While it may seem like a beginner's amp in terms of size, it is not really made for beginners. It is a pro-level amp and does not disappoint. Also, this amp really brings out the good and bad in different guitars, pickups and even cables. 
Some amps make your gear sound generic, but this thing really lets you hear the differences, no matter how subtle, with your gear. 
For example, I have a Gretsch where the 2nd selector position (neck and bridge both on) pickup setting sounded the same, or mostly the same, to the neck pickup on its own, through my other gear (Vox amp, Digitech modeler, etc.). With the HT-1, you can hear the differences, as if someone took the pillow off my guitar in that instance, for example.
Emulated output/headphones is stereo and sounds truly great.                
I only give it a 9 for "features" because it could be slightly better if it had an effects loop perhaps. But when using an amp this small, you probably would not want to connect a bunch of other gear in your signal chain and for recording, you can do your time based effects on the computer (delay, etc.). Otherwise, you defeat the simple portability of the HT-1. 
Having said that, it does come with stereo headphone/emulated output (the reverb effect is stereo) and also stereo input for MP3/other sound sources (to play along with for example). The headphone and line-in ports are both full-size 1/4" jacks, so you may need different cables or adapters depending on your existing gear.                
Easy to use, but please take your time to dial in settings you like. Subtle changes to pre-gain and post-gain and ISF can give you a lot of different sounds. Same with reverb. Behind the simple knobs lies some delicious tone.                
Heavy for its size and very well built. The speaker, though small, is designed to take loud volume without farting out. High quality pro gear. I do not think replacing the speaker or the tubes is necessary whatsoever. Give the amp a few hours for the speaker to break in a bit. And make sure you use a really good cable. Believe it or not, different cables can improve your sounds because guitars send out tiny signals over the cable and that tiny signal is prone to changing over the length of the cable. Better cables will give you better resolution, high frequency, and sustain.                
I think it is a 10 for "value", but I give a 9 because it actually is expensive for a small amp. However, it is fantastic, so you get what you pay for in that regard. A 1 watt boutique tube amp? This is the real deal.                
Haven't had to ask for support yet - but I think Korg USA is the support department for the USA.                
I like the Blackstar asthetic, grill cloth and marketing. Look online for some of their videos. For example, if you like metal, look for Andy James playing the HT-1 using emulated output. Amazing. While it can do hard rock and classic rock, it has a great round and smooth blues tone too, and I personally mainly use mine on the clean setting with a bit of preamp tube breakup crunch.                
Great great amp, if you want to get better, this is for you.
If you are already a pro, this is for you. 
Just starting out? Maybe, but it will not give you the instant tone gratification of a modeling amp and let you go from jazz to country to insane metal by pressing a button. It will amplify your personal tone and skill. If you are just starting out, just be patient as it will not gloss over unclean playing as a lot of amps will.                
Bought this one as B-stock for $220, saving of $80. When the amp arived the clean channel sound ok, but the overdrive channel is very microphonic. I spend $10 order another preamp 12Ax7 tube. Open the back and the top rear screw on the handle, change the tube and everything sound great. Plug in my mp3 player and sound like I'm in concert.                
For it size and portability this amp is good. It give a lot of bite and growl if that is what your looking for. It can also give you clean but with very little volume. I found the sound to be tinny or boxey. I add a HT-112 12" speaker cabinet and the quality of the sound improved dramatically.                
The sound is great. I like that I can tweak the characteristics of the amp and get the singing, clear sound and then twist a few dials and it gets a little dirty without ever going over the top. I have been trying to sound like Clapton  for 15 years now and this amp has gotten me closer. Plus I can tune the amp from Sunshine to Layla. The amp is the love child of a Fender and Marshall.                
I like the ISF feature. Simple and fun. The reverb is much better than expected for a digital effect. I am a fan of spring reverb and that kept a Fender in the picture for me. However, I am a fan of the stand alone Fender reverb tank so was not a big deal in the decision.                
Easy to use; straight forward design and settings card is a great start for dialing in your sound.                
Well built; cannot find any flaws, rattles; and I bought a blemished model. I see this amp being with me for a long time.                
What a great amp for a great price. I got it to play at home. The volume is great for 5 watts and the price is awesome. I got mine less than full price but would have gladly paid $450. The blemished I got for a discount just convinced me to stop waiting and buy the amp.                
No need at this time and don't see any in the future                
Wow, wow, wow. I still want a Fender Super sonic and will justify the purchase due to the higher wattage. However, every time I play the Blackstar I forget that other amps exist. If you want one stop waiting. You are only depriving yourself of happiness. I call it a smile machine because every time I play it I can't stop smiling.                
This amp is exactly what I was looking for. I played several amps before choosing this one. The decision came down to this amp and a Fender super sonic. I love the Fender sound and reverb. the Blackstar gives a sound that is equal to the Fender but the distortion and gain are much better. The clean channel sings as sweet as a bird in spring after a long winter. The overdrive channel is full but overly dirty giving a sweet distortion that never breaks apart. what sold me is the clean channel. It is responsive and clear. I am extremely happy with the amp. I like that I can get a fender sound and then add some more gain to it. That in between settings are a sound all the amps own. If your ears have different moods and can't decide what sound you want from day to day this is your amp. Even if you are a Fender or Marshall guy this is your amp. Sometimes you need/want a little different sound and this amp does it with ease. It is a classic sound with modern function.                
Going through the stock speaker, it simply sounds amazing. The only problem I had was with the emulated output. Going through the stock speaker and using the power tubes, you can overdrive to your hearts content and it sounds great, this is not true for the emulated output. If you push the amp too hard while using the emulated output, it gives a digital distortion sound.
I found the ISF feature to be quite nice and works as advertised.
One thing to note is that if you are in an apartment, you may want to go with the 1 watt version because this one can easily get you kicked out on the dirty channel (and probably on the clean channel as well).
Just for fun, I connected my Eden D210T bass cab to this amp and it actually sounded great with my bass.                
Features are nice and simple, the reverb adds that little touch that makes you sound a little better than you are.
Has outputs for a single 8 ohm cab, 2x16 ohm cabs, or a single 16 ohm cab (the internal speaker is 16 ohm)                
Turn knobs, doesn't get much easier. The preset suggestions provided sound quite good.                
The quality is pretty good, I have doubts about how long the covering will last, but only time will tell.
I certainly don't think the handle will be breaking anytime soon though.                
Quite simply, it does a great job and what it's meant to do and for the sound quality and the price, it's definitely affordable.                
I haven't had to contact Blackstar.                
I love the Blackstar logo for sure. Plus it came with a Blackstar sticker to put on something. The grill cloth is pretty snazzy and the piping around it is a very nice touch.                
I feel this amp is versatile enough that I won't need to replace it anytime soon. I think the only reason to replace this amp would be to get the 1 watt version for a quieter practice.                 
The best clean/dirty tones I've heard in 28 years. You will find your tone with this amp it is that versatile. I use it in the studio and live. I have not played a guitar through I haven't been able to dial in a great tone for.                 
Loaded with ins and outs. Ohm selector switch for multiple speaker cabinet extensions, mp3 line in, footswitch, speaker emulated line out, and more.                
Very easy to use.                 
Sleek, black, cool, black, classic, black, did I mention it's black? And it looks awesome! Built like a tank.                
I've owned several amps in 28 years and this one exceeds the best value for the money.                
Awesome. I have it.                
There are so many amps out there that do one thing or another great, but this amp truly does it all.                
perfect practice amp! louder than you need, plus it ROCKS pushing my Marshall 4 x 12 cab!  the attack is insane and the range of tone is vast. Everything about this amp is well made and exceeds expectations! a multi-effects pedal is awesome to run through the fx loop, the only semi-necessary addition might be an eq pedal to help polish and focus especially with the clean channel (which is beautiful, but lets get real if you are looking at this amp its not for the clean), which only has a tone knob                
The amp's clean channel is warm with a smooth bell-like tone, up to about the half way mark with regards to level. Then the valves start to clip with a beautiful light drive. This is what the drive channel builds on. The overdrive channel starts off with some light valve drive all the way to fire-breathing, face-melting filth! This amp doesn't sound like a small, driven amp, but like a 100w stack going nuclear, but at a usable volume. The ISF feature is extremely effective in sculpting the tone anywhere between UK and USA, providing true versatility. Both channels share tone controls and the ISF feature                
This amp has most of the bells and whistles you can think of: Two channels - of course! It allows for headphones, an extended cab, includes a footswitch, a bank of equalizer controls, and the tone shaping feature is something I just don't get tired of playing with, and the sounds you can get from the distortion is just wonderful, and you don't have to blow down the neighbor's house with volume to get it!                
The HT5 is one of the few low-wattage tube amps that has a direct out/headphone input, which is super convenient. Don?t underestimate what 5 tube watts sounds like at full blast ? it?s definitely loud enough to irritate all but the coolest/deafest of neighbors. To that end, the 1/12 and 4/12 cab simulation w/the headphones is nice and works well when playing loud just isn?t an option. Haven?t used the direct out for recording yet, but I?ve heard good things. All in all, there?s a decent amount of competition for the HT5 (Egnater, Orange, etc.), but you simply won?t find this many features and this much tone anywhere NEAR this price elsewhere. If you need something for a small space, for practicing, or for portability without sacrificing KILLER tone, I?d definitely suggest the HT5.                 
The amp seems rugged and durable, and the overall feel of it is that it is well built. On the other hand, I have only owned it a few weeks so far - but I don't foresee any problems. The sound quality pretty much classifies this amp as being in the boutique class, and as such is at the bottom range of the boutique scale. To find an amp sound to compare it to, I think you are probably going to have to spend about a thousand dollars, so this is a steal!                 
I would by another one.                
No need for support at this time.                
Love it.                
This amp is going to go down in guitar history as a classic. It has a very warm, rich sound with more than enough volume for bedroom use. The tone with the ISF knob on the USA side is reminiscent of a hot rodded Marshall JMP. If you have a LP with Burstbuckers, you're golden. You get a nice, complex, woody crunch. On the British side,but still very ballsy and good for blues and classic rock. It even came with a footswitch. The cabinet is very solid and seems well built. And it has a Celestion! I can't find anything to complain about with this amp. I've had and sold many amps since I started playing, but this one's a keeper!                 
I got this amp about three months ago and I still haven't been able to find tone I didn't like! I sold all my electric gear about five years ago, due to economic situations. So I bought a pretty nice used guitar, and I'd been searching for the right amp. I live in a four unit apartment, so I wanted something that sounded great at lower volumes, but could also be used for some lighter live work. Well here's the problem with this amp. I love it!! I mean I really love it! I think tonewise, it's the best amp I've ever owned, and I've had quite few throughout the years! I did a lot of listening to small combos on Youtube, and decided to go with this one just from the videos and reviews. So I wanted to add my review, because I like it so much! I would've also reviewed if it sucked, or was bland, but I'm very happy to say I'm happy! And If I ever need to step up to a bigger amp, I'm going to get a Blackstar! (I have had no issues with this amp. It came very well packed, and works great!)                
A few thoughts...
The Blackbird speaker is great for high gain but it really lacks any clean tone. It just makes the amp lifeless unless you got the gain cranked. I took it out of my HT-5R combo and right now its basically a big square head running into a Vox 112NT cab loaded with a Celestion Greenback.
The Celestion Greenback really makes this amp come alive both clean and dirty. It adds some much needed sparkle to the treble and makes the cleans go from lifeless to amazing. It makes the gain channel just that much more incredible.
I do plan on putting a speaker back in it, I just have not decided what yet. I am trying to decide between a WGS Green Beret and a WGS ET65.
I am also using the stock tubes that came in it. I have no idea if they are cheap chinese tubes or high quality. It sounds good so I am not even going to mess with them. 
The price is a bit high for a 5 Watt amp but its still a reasonable value for what you get. I highly recommend this amp to anyone that either wants some killer gain or some killer gain and cleans if willing to change out the speaker. Figure after a speaker this is now close to a $600 5 watt combo.                 
Wow just wow. This little amp is amazing. I had my reservations that it may not meet my expectations since I normally play fender amps. But I must say this little thing is the best sounding amp I own now. It is also very versatile with the different tone options. It may not be the loudest amp around but for what I needed, it is more than perfect. If all Blackstar amps are this good and have this good of quality, it may be time for me to invest in a larger one for gigs as well, and put my other amps on the bench for a while. If you want a clean sounding amp that can go from crystal clear notes all the way to nice and dirty, then this amp is perfect for you. I have been playing this thing non stop since I got it and I am still just scratching the surface of what this amp can do. I foresee many years of use for this little workhorse.                
The amp is fantastic and can go from shimering cleans to eaging distortion witha click of the footswitch. This amp blows away a Blues Jr and anything else comming within hundreds of what this amp cost. You won't find a better more versatile amp anywhere regardless of price. I have been playing for 35 years and I love this amp..                
I love the sound from this amp out of the box. I was surprised to find Ruby tubes in it. I had heard they were Sovtek. So the initial sound was really good with the Ruby tube until you turn the gain on the overdrive channel. It got really over done and loss of clarity. when gain was about 7 to 10. I read some of the forums, tested a few different brand tubes in the preamp tube, changed to a JJ long plate Gold pin ECC803/12AX& and the sound went into a heavenly smooth distortion, great breakup at all levels. It is not a high gain sound but great distorted tone over all. Love this Amp.                
this amp  has a TON of features.  just read the specs. but more than that, it SOUND great. the tube "feel" is there also. very responsive to pick attack also. you can be screaming on the od channel, back off the volume and go almost to clean.  the clean channel feels and sound just fine to me. it also compresses well anywhere past "5" . i have two gripes.....the gain channel seems to be more "open" than my marshalls. i havent given up, but i havent dialed in that thick, syrupy lead tone that i get with all my marshalls.  there's tons of gain there, the eq is powerfull, but i just havent got my lead tone yet.  gripe 2.....mine does not do "crunch" tones at all. just od+. even with the gain wayy down, its od, not crunch. the verb is very useable. now, i also own the ht dual pedal. everyone says it the same ht circuits. bull.  my ht dual does perfect crunch-hot rodded jcm 800 all on the crunch channel. the od channel is instant thick, syrupy leads. my ht dual, into the clean channel of ANY amp sounds and feels more marshall THAN marshall and i own a room full of them.  if you need a quality, full featured small amp this is a good one.                
Amazing tone out of this amp for any genre or sound. I have several tube amps i use for recording but the blackstar has retired many of them since i got it. i use it for practice studio and live as a monitor utilizing the emulated out to run signal to a PA system.                
The amp sounds killer. But this is after i put a different speaker in. Celestion greenback. Original speaker very fizzy and hard to get good crunch out of. Dont let this put you off a great amp though.                
I HEAR IT! The tone in my head! I should say "tones" because this amp is versatile. I am amazed at the tonal capabilities of this amp. I am able to get great tone from this amp with all my guitars. Not just one or two that sound the best, but great tone from all my guitars. I have used it in a live rehearsal setting mic'd through the church PA system and it is gigantic. At my home studio it is now my main amp. It is fully compatible with my style. I do rock based contemporary worship music and I have a 80's hard rock edge to my playing. I really don't know if there was a style it couldn't handle. I am really impressed with Blackstar.                
All kinds of features whether you use them or not, 16 and 8 ohm outs, mp3/line in, speaker emulated outs for direct recording, 112 and 412 selector switch, on and on. They thought of everything.                
Very easy to tweak. It's standard stuff, volume, gain, treb, mid, bass, etc. But this does have a unique ISF control which allows you to get a full American 6L6ish tone all the way to a British EL34 growl or anywhere in between. Nice touch. No learning curves, just adjust this beauty to taste using simple analog knobs.                  
Very impressive build quality. Classic yet contemporary. This amp packs massive tone in it's smaller than expected package. I wouldn't have it any other way. It's slightly more compact size makes it lighter and easier to tote around.                
This is is as good as it gets today. In fact, in is one of the best values in a long time. Great, keep up the good work Blackstar!                
I hear this. I never used them. I have two Blackstar products, the great HT Dual pedal (or should I say amp in a pedal), and the crazy awesome Blackstar HT5R 112 which awes me.                
Major tone sex appeal.                 
I play everything from Blues, to Metal.  This amp will get you most anywhere you want to go.  If there is one thing I dont like, I wish it had an EQ built-in for the clean side rather than a TONE knob.  The clean sound can sound a bit thin at times, but nothing I cant work with.  I love the ISF knob.  I usually leave it on the brit side, but I do like to throw some US in there every now and then.  The ranges you can get out of this.....it is great.  From Marshall to Mesa on the gain side.  The clean side really isnt anything.  It sure isnt a Fender clean sound, but it isnt too bad.                
I love the features.  Foot controller, the ability to use headphones without hurting the amp (cant do this with most all tube amps).  The ISF sound shaping is nice.  
My problem with the features.  1)  Only a tone knob for the clean channel.  2) ISF does not change anything on the clean channel.  
I can get the clean channel to break up a bit, others are better, but overall, it is very good.                
Simple to use....if you have ever used an amp.  The instructions for using the headphones and the speaker emulator leave a little to be desired, but not hard to figure out.                
I cant say.  Had it 3 weeks and it is still working fine.                
A pretty good price for an all tube amp.                
Never had to deal with them.                
It is not a Marshall JCM or a Mesa....or a Fender, but it is nice.  It sounds very good.  The gain is the best part of the amp.                
It is a good amp at a great price.  For the price, I dont thinky ou can beat it.  This thing is a gain monster.  The gain is very nice, but it keeps the clarity.  The clean channel is a bit thin at times, but useable.  From Blues to Metal and eve rything between, it is pretty darn good.  Get one, you WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!                
This is a very versatile amp. It goes from clean to crunch to heavy distortion. I am blown away by the quality of sound. I can't imagine that you would be disappointed with this amp unless you required more volume. The high gain channel is very loud for 5 watts. If you are looking for a great tube amp that responds well to your playing, look no further. I really did my homework on this one.                 
Great that it comes with a pedal to switch channels.                
Very easy to get the sound that you want                
Fit and finish were great                
A little pricey for 5 watts but worth it.                
Have not had an issue                
Built very solid                
I would definatly buy another one if lost or stolen                
I gave it an 8 because im being realistic, a 9 or 10 is much much more expensive. In it's price range it's a 10. Blackstars logo (the sound in your head)...it's true! Takes some time but once you find your sweet spot your in like flint. No boxy sound, good bottom end. The clean channel is very nice with the volume 1/2 way. If you dime it you can start to get some crunch! Responds to pick attack very well and works great with pedals. The overdrive is a little more tricky, gonna need a soundgate, volume past 3/4 and you get some hum and feedback that's with the gain at 10. Back volume off to 1/2 and gain at 3/4 and it's glorious! That's the sweetspot for your effects too. You can use your overdrive to push the amp into the sound in your head. Buy this amp.                 
It's all here!                
A little tricky, takes time but that's part of the fun.                 
Nice!                
This is the #1 best value out there, thank you very much Blackstar and the dirt poor dude that put the thing together. Nice.                 
To soon, hope for the best.                 
It looks really good in my little area my wife allows me, sharpe looks.                 
Blackstar is doing it right.                 
I was playing through it with my Schecter (active EMGS) all night and it sounds awesome. After dialing in the right tone I am in love. Don't assume that because I play active EMGs that I am a metalhead. I love the way active pups sound for any style of playing, just my preference.                
Very versatile, has two channels, has reverb, enough said. Not sure that I can hear much difference with the 4x12 emulater vs the 1x12 standard setting. I have not messed it much though.                
Like I said, I was not sold on this amp out of the box, but after some research I got it dialed in and it sounds great.                
The material cover the front is stretched around the middle, like it was leaning on it or something. Not very noticeable though.                
Comparable price to other quality 5-15w amps, with more features                
NA                
When I first plugged in I was a little unsure whether I had made the right decision by buying this amp over the Marshall Class 5, but after splitting up my pedalboard correctly through the effects loop I am sold. I also have a Fender Vibrolux Reverb and a small traynor solid state. I wanted a small tube amp to take place of the Traynor. Also, my roommate has a Fender Blues Jr and this thing rivals that in tone, and offers so much more. I did a lot of homework on small tube amps, and this is in my opinion the best value. I chose the reverb version because I love reverb and read good reviews, the reverb is ok but does not match my vibrolux.                
I took a chance on this cabinet for my Marshall Origin 20 watt combo amp. To give it a little more bottom end and fuller bigger sound stage. It worked out very good. The Celestion 70/80 speaker delivers all of what I hoped for. Together with the Celestion V type 10" speaker in the amp I am getting the best of both sonic worlds.The cabinet itself is solidly made. I could have wished for a pine or birch finger jointed cabinet but for this price it gives me all I can expect. The cabinet is made form MDF but it's not nearly as heavy as I was expecting it to be. Well worth the price point and beyond.As always zZounds delivers all anyone could ever expect.                
I bought this amp a few months back and waited to review it so that I could be as informative as possible. First thing is that the patches are place in banks of four when you use the footswitch (optional) that to me should have been included. If you use a midi footswitch and I have one (Rocktron Midi Mate) you may assign any way you choose. There are several ways to get the most out of this amplifier. Remember what I said about patches? The first 12 patches are available to you without the footswitch! You can select them from the front panel, keeping in mind there are three banks with four patches per bank. once you select a bank you can then move left to right to get the patches. They are laid out logically, 1st patch on each bank allows for a clean sound, 2nd patch more crunch, 3rd patch more gain and so one until you get to the 4th that will allow you the most gain and effects for lead or whatever. Now you have the rundown. The patches can be changed and instantly saved to via pushing the patch location, (you can change to any of the 12 without a foot switch) until it blinks, then press again to save. If you want more control over the other 110 patches you will need the insider software. Yes there is software that you can download to unlock the amps true potential. First off once you have the installed software and the computer connected to the amp. it will show you all the patches, which can be selected and demoed at that time. you can make adjustments to taste (saving if you choose), you may move patches to an order that fits your style or needs. There is also a really cool feature that allows you to download and upload patches others or you have created. Once you find what you like, they are described by the creator with comments such as hot blues, or even Metallica clean and so on. Keep in mind that creator may not be playing the same instrument and pickups as you! You may have to try different offerings for similar descriptions. be patient, you will find something you like. If you are really patient you can create something you like. I have been playing awhile so these types of offerings do not hinder or intimidate me. I just jumped in and thought everything worked as it should. The only thing I think I should point out is that you can not drag and drop patches. I believe this is done to prevent accidental overwriting. having said that, I have 5 of these amps in different sizes a 15 watt (8-10 in SPKR) the 30 watt and 60 watt single speaker combos.(both 12s) and 2 of the 260s (2x12) I have them all programmed the same! I can take anyone out and my sound is consistent! also one more feature of these amps is the speaker out emulation, it is superb, in most cases when I go out I take 2 EV 1000 watt (active)  15 inch full range speakers and run the emulation to both! This allows me to quickly and very efficiently cover the entire stage in sound! The entire band can not only hear me, but adjust how much and where. this is a game changer! I use the source amp as a monitor as it allows you to use that amp volume separately from the emulation! and having all the amps set the same allows me the choice of any config I like and still get the sound that I need. I hope this assists you,                
I was looking for a combo that would deliver great tone, versatility, and performance for playing out and for use at practice with a drummer in the room.
I was extremely reluctant to go with this (or any modeling type of amp) over tube, as I am not a fan of digital sounding distortion tones.
I can honestly say I have never been more surprised. My initial thought was my expectations were simply lowered, but it keeps sounding great in a solo and band setting and keeps putting a smile on my face.
Review scores are in relation to other offerings in this price range. (Will this sound better than a $4,000 tube amp? No...but how does it score against other offerings in the same range?)
Tone: 10
The TVP combined with the two 12's delivers a very convincing tube feel and punch, along with tube type response to pick attack and pickup volume. My other guitarist is a notorious tone snob (more than I), and even he was impressed with the tone, volume, and presence this combo produces. Add in the ability to dial in your own pre and power tubes, and this amp can delver a wide range of useable tones...not just different, but actual tones you would want to use. Quite happy with this in the tone department. The speakers are Celestion Seventy 80's (look to be OEM for this amp judging by the magnet label), but they sound great. Plenty of low end punch, plenty of presence and they hold up well at high volumes.
Features: 8
The TVP is the star of the show, and it is fantastic at what it does. I was able to dial in a few different useable voices very quickly. The mix of EQ, Resonance (low frequencies), Presence (high frequencies), and possible combinations of pre and power tubes allow you a ton of versatility. The effects are pretty good...not outstanding, but quite decent in moderation. By far, the way to use the features is the Insider software, which allows for full control of all the features as well as patch export/import/sync to amp. You get granular control of the effects in a graphical format that mimics real pedals for ease of use.
Quality: 8
The only knock I can give on quality is the corner protectors being shiny hard plastic in feel. But really, that is a nit-pick that is easily overlooked. The quality is solid on this amp, and it looks and feels like you would expect from a great mid-priced amp.
One last thing of note - the stereo effect (especially with the new super wide stereo that is in the latest Insider firmware/software update) is very, very good. The reverb and delay especially shine here. Great sounding amp all around, with all the versatility you could ask for and enough power to play a small to medium size gig without a mains if you had to. Holds up quite well at high volumes.                
I have to be straight up. I am a former bassist, who decided at the age of 50 to learn and play guitar.  Most of the stuff I love range from Johnny Cash to Pink Floyd.  If that's not a broad enough range then throw in some CCR and Yardbirds for good measure.
I know the difference between valve and solid state.  I'm a guitar novice but I'm not daft as my Brit friends would say, and although this amp is not perfect, it's a lot of fun dialing it in to play the type of stuff I love.  For example I just opened the box and for the fun of it dialed in You Really Got Me, but within a few minutes of that also managed to dial in Led Zeppelin The Immigrant Song and Rock and Roll.
That's what I mean when I said that this amp is a lot of fun.  It gives the player (ahem) enough range to experiment and tweak their sound.  When I was in the mood for a little Man in Black, RING OF FIRE, it didn't take long to find that nice warm country sound with a little bite that song requires.
Is the amp loud?  Yes, but not so loud you will blow out your windows.  Is it a dead bang for the valve emulations?  No, but its pretty damned close, and if you don't have the funding for a half stack valve Marshall or Mesa, this is a viable option.  
I play a Stratocaster (EMG DG20s.  God knows I love my Floyd), a Taylor and most recently a Gibson Les Paul Standard, and for the first time I have to say my guitars came alive.  Coming from a Fender FM 212 to The Blackstar ID260 is like being reborn musically.   There is tremendous range and endless possibilities.
However, now for the not so flattering.  I think its bulls**t that  Blackstar forces us to spend another $89. for the foot controller.  Even Fender includes foot controllers in its Mustang line.  To really see what this amp has and is capable of the footswitch is mandatory.  Hopefully one day I will get one.
Anyway, this has been a novices review of the Blackstar ID260.  Hope it helped a little.                
I have great tube amps.  Of course you have to use pedals to customize your sound. The top is what sold me on the Blackstar.  I was skeptical but am now a believer and Im glad I took it over the boss katana.  When you switch the tvp on it punches your sound. Then you get to choose between 6 power tubes.  I have a hearing loss all my life and the difference between the tubes is very obvious.  The reverb is is great and the other options (there is a lot) are finely done.  This is more than a practice amp.  This could be a go to or back up amp.  I got it because my less Paul studio does take quite right to my tubes.  The Blackstar will be my amp for humbuckers.  The studio has coil tapping knobs and boy this amp marks a visible line between the two settings. For me I have to be able to hear the difference for it to make sense.  If you play without the tvp distortion sounds hollow but thats most solid states.  Just use the tvp and download the insider program to maximize the features.                  
I have played a lot of different amps over the years both tube and solid state, low end and high end. What some amps have others don't,  and when it comes to amplifiers, 99% of the time you get what you pay for. The Blackstar id260tvp is that 1% exception... This amp is seriously top notch tone. The best tone monster I have had the opportunity to own. This amp can cater to any style of player. The new EQ knobs paired with the ISF really let's you create the tone you're looking for. The TVP switch is legitimately some kind of sorcery... Tones within tones. You can have three effects running simultaneously without the online software each of which you can adjust the parameters. And to top it all off, you have it in Superwide Stereo. Hearing it in person is awesome. It's very emersive and you feel like what you're playing is around you. This amp is definitely an experience. Plenty of volume for recording and small venues sound keeps it's clarity at high volumes as well as break up at high volumes (like a classic tube would) but it depends on what you're going for. A lot of people talk mess about blackstar but they truly are great amplifiers. It is a pain in the rear that they don't include the footswitch, but in my personal opinion, this amp is worth every penny and I'm not disappointed one bit. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great amplifier that is studio, gigging, and practice ready and not a one-trick pony. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.                
I bought this Blackstar 260TVP to replace two Marshall Heads and 4x12 cabs for casino gigs. Great amp packed with features and some real usable tones. My biggest complaint was the malfunctioning drive channel after 5 months of gigs...The Korg web site is useless but, after a call found a local authorized repair facility. If it wasn't solid state I would bench it myself but, don't have that choice with the Blackstar. I will see if this repair is accurately diagnosed and fixed...I have my reservations at this point. I really dig the tone and the 60 watts stereo but, having a breakdown after 5 months of ownership is not a good omen.                
I was originally shopping for a budget tube amp when I came across this and it exceeded my expectations over all contenders.  This is everything anyone could want in a very portable and budget friendly amp.  With the FS-10 foot controller, it is a dream brought into reality.  You will swear there are tubes in it somewhere.  There is a midrange knob that is in the programming software (and it's as easy to use as turning on your computer) but I wish it were on the actual amp.                
Crystal clear & screaming distortion,all in a simple package, its easy to dial in infinite tones.                
I've had the privilege of owning a dozen tube amps over 20 years of giggin from six different manufacturer as well as four modeling amps/solid states from 4 different manufacturer...  All I can say is that,it surpasses all the modeling amps that I've own by hundreds of miles and comes extremely scary close by inches to many tube amps that I've gig with...                
very practical and to the point.....                  
no brainer... I was able to get awesome sounds really quick without the use of PC and store it! made minor tweaks during rehearsals and gig with it......                
good...  As far as reliability,I dont abuse my stuff so it should be well for years to come..                
very good considering if you would buy every amp it emulates you would have to work three jobs!                
they are always coming out with software updates and UK tech support, because its in the UK takes time. my only issue is not the amp but the software down load...
like I said,dynamics,frequency blending,touch sensitivity,responsiveness,live volume levels! its just too scary close to the real thing and so far I've had eight gigs with it and it fooled sound guys who are use to sticking a mic on tube amps! he! he!
The other wow factor is its very light weight!!!!!                
I am one to be known to get rid of gears really quick when it doesn't cut it  on two different bands that I play with! specially during a live gig where dynamics,high volume levels,frequency blending( which is  critical),touch sensitivity,responsiveness,if the amp is not happening! its getting ship back or sold... band members usually takes bets on how long I can keep some gear and laugh about it by the way.  Until they recently saw me sold almost all my tube amps and couple of modeling amps and  almost all my  pedals. I am now down to one awesome tube combo and five boss pedals. I'm not just keeping these few because they sound awesome,but because they've been with me and withstood the time of good gigs and bad gigs.  Sooooo to some it up,The Blackstar ID 60 1x12 pass all my test and its now my go to amp at all times! for gigs and rehearsals.. 
Ive always been leery of solid state amps because of their thin, weak output. This amp totally changed my impression of solid state/non tube amps. The TVP makes this amp really Rock!! So much clean power and volume from a single 12? that Im still in shock from clean to crunch; all the sounds are there. Since Im a techno-geek the Insider software is fun - Limitless sounds and combinations of tones (downloadable or create your own). LOVE this amp!! The footswitch makes cycling through patches a breeze; definitely recommend.                
This amp is loud! Too loud for the living room. It really does behave like a tube amp. I have had most of them. From a pre CBS twin to a plexi. Way too many to count or remember. As far as I can tell the "feel" is there, even if the tone may not be exact. It is pretty good for me. I have waited a while to write this review as I wanted to hear it in a variety of conditions. I just recently had it on stage with about a dozen other players all playing authentic tube amps and this thing shined. The foot pedal made it a chore but the sound was fantastic. If you are seriously considering this amp remember this, you will not like it at living room levels. You really have to crank it to get the tone. And  that point is painful to the ears in a confined space (you were warned). The thirty would probably be the best choice and onei would have made if it had a dedicated "mid" knob. The effects are usable and when used in concert with the software are very tweakable. The tvp knob has provided me with hours of fun. My only complaint is the overdrive tone. It sounds like a blown speaker at low levels and is VERY annoying, and they give no options of tone shaping it. Hopefully down the road they add this option. I almost returned it because of this awful buzz like property, but once you turn it up, it is far less annoying. The amp is reasonably light and as far as tone goes, blows away the spider valve it has replaced. This amp can and will keep up in any situation.                 
Got this beauty a few weeks ago and still finding new things about it.I've had a lot of amps over the years and never thought I would ever see a solid state amp that has the sound of a tube amp. There is no need to ever turn the TVP switch off.The clean channels are fantastic and the Crunch and O.D. channels are killer. I'm still finding new and inventive ways to push this bad boy. I haven't gigged it yet and still finding new tones to add to the arsenal. I do highly recommend getting the FS- 10 footswitch for even easier access to all the sounds and FX this has to offer.                
As a new guitarist I didn't know much about amps. I was looking to sound great but also stay within and budget and this amp did just that. I wanted to avoid tubes because I wasn't familiar with maintence and proper care for them so I decided to go with a digital amp. This amps true valve power switch is amazing and really makes the amp punch, as id like to call in the button that is always on.                
The ID60 TVP is a great amp with great tones. I also purchased the foot pedal for it which makes changing channels easier. If your looking for a great amp for practice or live use you can't go wrong with this one.                 
I already own the Club 50 with 2x12 cab, the HT-5 head, and numerous Blackstar pedals. I wanted to get something that was easier to transport. I have had it one day and I think it is a great amp, especially for the name and the price! I have not used the insider software option (probably won't), but I have found the amp easy to use after the initial learning curve! I am very satisfied with my purchase!!!                
I play at a church, I run my guitar thru a line 6 helix. I go stereo thru the house mixer for the recording but for the live sound i go thru the Blackstar amp. It sounds awesome and it just cuts thru the mix. I have it at half way volume setting at it doesnt distort in any way. I would recommend this for any guitarist playing at church.                
This is a solid amp that produces great tone. The stereo effects are impressive. Build quality appears to be good based on first impressions. It is large and heavy compared to most solid state units, which I like. You must provide your own USB cable for computer/DAW connections. The user guide is pretty basic, not written in Chinglish but definitely not published by Blackstar in the UK.I returned this amp after only a handful of short practice sessions. It died during my first attempt at using the included Blackstar Insider software. Connecting a laptop by USB cable brings up a message that a software update is available. If the update from the Internet fails for any reason, your amp becomes a large door-stop. Also note that (1) a laptop or desktop is required - no tablet or phone compatibility. (2) Windows 10 is not supported according to the Blackstar website (Windows 8 max). (3) running the software in a virtual machine environment is not recommended. I was looking forward to working with custom patches and lots of experimentation. Will not be buying anything with Internet based software again!                
I wanted a Bluetooth speaker to listen to music and thought I might as well get this to use the amp for guitar and bass. I ended up not using the amp that much as I have other amps which are more versatile. Sooo, I really just use it for the Bluetooth to play iTunes through. It sounds nice, seems well made although a bit pricey.                
This pedal does the job it was designed to do, though I believe it is overpriced.
Had they integrated a more robust tuner display into it, say something that replaces a Boss TU2 with a nice chromatic display, it would have been worth the money. As it is, you get the nearest note in the display and have to rely on the switch LED's to indicate if you are sharp or flat. The middle LED indicator is not quite sensitive enough, and you will need to use your ears to fine tune.
You can set this to adjust the effects, to directly access patches 1-4, or to navigate through all 128 patches. When you are navigation mode, you have to commit the Patch change with the far right switch. This is useful if you want to start the song on (for instance) patch 12 and switch to patch 1 during the song. Once you are on patch 12, you can click down to patch 1 - it will flash while you keep playing on patch 12, and will change to patch 1 only when you click the far right switch.
There are other features to allow you to store patches, but it's far simpler to use the Insider software or the amp front to do this. 
The use of the 1/4 cable as a link cable is nice - no expensive cable to buy if the included one gets messed up.
All in all, decently built, but in hindsight a simple midi footswitch would have gotten the job done for me at half the price considering what I use it for - direct access to patches 1-4.                
This amplifier deffinately lives up to all the great reviews regarding it's flexibility, dynamic response. The approach Blackstar took to replicate voltage interaction between amp and speaker of the various tubes as a means of reproducing the dynamics and musical harmonic texture by far surpasses any typical digital modeling system I've ever used. The depth of the stereo effects is impressive also. Panning is deep and produces a physical sense of motion. The reverbs are lush, musical and controllable. The EQ options are responsive and the ISF knob provides, what I would consider, the ideal means of controlling the character of the mid range response. The master resonance(low mid/bass response) and presence(high mid/treble) work great to allow you to switch between TVP tube simulations without having unpleasent incongruity. The only negative issue I can think of is the lack of an effects loop as I use a looper pedal and it either has to go in the front of the amp which gets muddled quickly, or in the back via the mp3 jack which doesn't accomplish matching the line level with the input level very well. The Blackstar footswitch, an extra 90 bucks, Ch1 (patch mode) has a latency issue of maybe 200 miliseconds, maybe a little more. There is less in nav mode but you have to select a bank/channel and then press the recall(4th) button to actually make the switch. There is also noise introduced when the footpedal is plugged in. I couldnt use the emulated line out with a Zoom h1 recorder because of the ticking produced by the footpedal.                
Totally worth the price. No nonsense quick control. no special cables. The 3 modes are handy being able to select a spec. program and switch to manual mode and turn individual fx on and off.                
Ive been playin on this little amp about a month now and I absolutely love it. Its as loud as it needs to be for bedroom practicing and the delay works good. Getting pretty decent tone out of it also.                
I got this amp from zZounds using their payment plan.  Really put it within reach for me. 
At first I was ok with the amp, it was very nice but their were some things about the tone that wasn't doing it for me.  Then...  I found out it has external bias adjustments, (meaning you don't have to drop the head from the combo to get to the adjustment screws. to Bias the output tubes) They even included a green and red LED for each adjustment, so you don't need any special equipment to do this.  
I set the balance adjustment (the hole closest to the tubes) so both LEDS are out.  Then I adjusted the drive (the hole further from the tubes). On this adjustment the LEDS tell you Cool -(green) and Hot - (red). I took it into the red then backed off just enough for the red LED to go out.  So it was at the top of the range.   It made this amp come alive.  I was totally blown away.  It has been about 3 months since I did this and I'm still loving the tone.  I have Fat / Thick cleans, nice 1/2 distorted for playing rhythm, then super saturated for getting heavy and shredding leads.  For pedals, I only use a sonic maximizer and my Wah pedal. Nothing else is needed.   
Another featured that I figured would suck, but doesn't, is the Line Out with 4x12 or 1x12 simulation modes.  I have NEVER (i mean Never) had a direct out that was usable in any way.  This one is beyond usable, it actually sounds very nice. I blend it with the 2 mics I put on it , (Cascade Fat Head II ribbon and a MD421) and get a great sound. 
Anyway, if you're at least a little bit handy, it's pretty easy to dial in this amp.  BTW, I'm using an '83 American Stratocaster with 1 SD Hot Rail and the 2 stock single coils that came in it.  Hot rail for distortion, and the single coils for clean playing.  
I have finally found a Combo that I can use for playing-out, and not feel like I'm compromising.
My Big rig is a rack system with ADA preamp, Mesa Boogie 50/50 and 2 Marshal 4x12's.  And after 25 years, I think I may be able to stop using.                
This amp is an incredible value. Yes it's made it China. What isn't anymore. The only negative thing i have to say about the amp is the crappy 2 button footswitch that comes with it. I HIGHLY recommend getting the 5 button footswitch....if you can find one. I got my amp from zZounds....awesome company and service....but they did not have the 5 button footswitch which adds a whole new level of flexibility to the amp. I had to wait on a 30 day back order for the FSW. It was worth the wait. The option to switch the voices on and off on each channel is really cool. The tone of this amp is really incredible. The clean channel can do Fender or switch to a more gritty tone like an old VOX or Marshall. The 1st OD channel picks up from there with nice gritty Plexi like tones all the way up JCM 800 chunk. Kick in the voice and you've got even more gain and top end. The 2nd OD channel sounds best to me with voice left on. It's kind of muddy sounding without it and the channels share the EQ so that's a bit of a drawback but I can live with that. I set that channel up for soloing and leave it that way. The cabinet voiced direct out sounds great and you can choose different cab sims. i use the 4x12. I use it live as well as miking and my tone is fat and thick as thieves I use FX but I only use the amp for distortion. I'm using a Digitech RP1000 for FX and I play a USA Fender Elite Strat as well as a couple of Shecters. I bought every piece of gear I own from zZounds.through their payment plan.It's a great company and their the only ones that offer a no credit check payment plan with no interest. Pay your bill on time and they increase your limit and give you more time. How cool is that for a poor working musician? Overall you can't go wrong with this amp. I shaved a couple of stars off features because I think the full function foot switch should come with the amp It's another $80.                
I bought this amp used but was in great shape still had stickers on it. Wasn't long till the tubes went out. I replaced them and after a year and a half the thing quit working all together. I've had tube amps before. A couple of Fenders and an Ampeg. Never problems like these so early on. Then to top it off it's hard to find anyone to work on these things. I'll never by another and will be selling this one if I can get it fixed. Total junk and lousy customer support.                
Blackstar has raised the bar on bass combo amps. The construction is second to none, and it's loaded with effects that leave all the other manufacturers in the dust. Good luck Ampeg and Fender. You guys better think of something fast, because Blackstar is the one to beat now.                
Very transparent sound. Rich detail and low noise.                
standard pre-amp features: phantom power/padding/phase on/off for each channel and 2x 1/4 TRS output                
Minutes to power up and get recording. very simple and straight forward                
solid metal case and dials/switches also seem very sturdy.                
The level of detail this brings out in recordings is very much worth every penny spent on this device.                
N/A                
I wasn't aware how much nicer recordings could sound with such a simple upgrade as a mic pre-amp.                
I tested out this new pre-amp by comparing it with my current setup. I have been using the internal pre's on the Scarlett 6i6 for about 3 years for miking guitar amps with a SM57, e609 or Octavia MK-319 and been very pleased. Recently I found myself needing to record from 4 microphones at the same time. Adding the Auteur MKII to my setup was suggested as a way i could accomplish this task. The MKII was quick to setup, one external AC adapter and 2 1/4" TRS cables to plug it into my 6i6 and I was ready to go. I tested it head-to-head with the internal pre's on the 6i6 using 2 octavia MK-319's, one plugged into the 6i6 and one into the MKII. The source material was an acoustic Yamaha baby grand piano. Both microphones were placed next to each other. Comparing the recording from the MKII to the 6i6 is pretty eye opening. While the pre's on the 6i6 are very quiet the MKII is a lot quieter, and this quietness seems to translate to more detail. I play piano with the sustain pedal down constantly and the MKII resolved all the resonant frequencies wonderfully. It also brought immense clarity to the decay of each note. I've been so happy with the 6i6 that I went into this comparison thinking I would have to listen very closely to hear a difference between these two pre-amps. The extra detail and space that the Auteur MKII brings to recording is going to make it my default pre-amp going forward.                
I have been using this preamp for just about a month now and it has surpassed my expectations. My only complaint is the silly wall wart power supply, but I guess if they are going to skimp on something to keep it affordable that isn't the worst place to do so. Everything else sounds, looks and feels great!
I have had no issues with the preamp but I have done business directly with BLA before and they are a great company who are willing to go above and beyond to help.                
I am very pleased with the sound of this little preamp. For the price it cannot, I repeat, cannot be beat. Most neve 1073s sound a little different in their own right. And this little guy has some great character of its own. Clean top end but warm, and big warm lo end too. And the built in DI sounds pretty good too. Definitely better than anything I've heard in the price range. I've worked with Neve hear, Api, Universal Audio, etc. and this unit hold its own right next to all the great pieces of gear.. I'm actually going to purchase a second one to have a stereo pair :)                
Let it warm up. I`ll turn it on and go do something else for a while.                
I actually LIKE the stepped gain. Makes recalling a breeze, and the way the steps are set are just right.                
You just need to work the line level of your interface with the output of the B173.                
Built like a brick. Heavier than expected.                
It is pricier than items like the GAP, but well worth it. This unit really sounds professional.                
No problems yet.                
The sound(in combination with Antelope converters), is extremely professional sounding. Ready for the radio.                
After reading some hoopla about it being "noisy", I was a little skeptical..But the tracks people were posting sounded beautiful! I picked this over the Golden Age and never looked back. It sounds a LOT more expensive than it is. The instructions say to let it warm up for a few minutes, but I`ve found after using it, around an hour and it`s gets even better. I`m using it into an Antelope Zen for the vocal channel. Incredible combo. The B173 sounds twice the price.                
You can't crank the gain on this preamp too much with out affecting distortion. Keep the gain low and the output ay about 3 o'clock for good sound.                
I'm not a musician, so I have no use for the D/I, or the crunchy output potential.                
Depending on your voice quality, you'll need to adjust the countless permutations of levels going in and coming our of each device to get optimal sound. After a few hours, it's easy to get a feel for proper settings.                
Nice feel to the knobs, with good solid clicks with each turn.                
Yep. Zzounds gave me the best price on this baby!                
No communication with company thus far.                
It's overall quality can be measured in it's warm sound. That's all that matters.                
My BL B173 is linked to a Tascam UH-7000 (interface setting only) and sounds rich, textured and warm. The Tascam preamp alone is super-clean, but slightly thin. The B173 added to the audio chain is perfect for my resonant voice.                
This box is AWESOME! There was an immediate, noticeable improvement in my tracks right outa the box! I had no idea how important a good clock is to the quality of the audio.I have more depth, width, and detail. I don't even have a lot of digital gear. I just hooked the Micro Clock up to my digital mixer, and that's it! I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this product!                
Just got this in today, yeah yeah yeah , its not the latest and greatest, but clocking my motu828es to 44.1 listening back to a session recorded on another interface, The harshness is gone, its the equivalent to being blurry eyed from a pool with extra chlorine then going to a 4K viewI can hear details in my mix, that before where smearedReady to start tracking with the updated setupIt just works, no frills, just does the job!                
Just do it!!!   Really I am astounded at the difference in my tracks. Open detailed, seems to have more content.                 
Black Lion is a small company that builds exceptional value into their audio product line, at bargain prices. They also specialize in custom modification of some audio equipment made by other manufacturers. The Micro Clock MKII is no exception. Using it as a 'master' clock in the studio, has enabled me to record at higher sample rates, with more confidence, knowing that the recorded sound source is continually and more faithfully reproduced at playback, without added 'artifacts,' that sometimes occur in the digital conversion process. I am told that there is an added benefit to using the micro clock that 'opens or, widens' the audible stereo field. What I know is it sounds no worse (and that is saying something, whenever adding additional units in an electronic audio chain) and it very well may improve the quality of sound. If you are linking more than one digital device in your studio, I believe you will benefit from purchasing a Black Lion Micro Clock MKII as the master timing source. Play good and mix well.                
Blackbird pedalboards are probably the best value for this type of board. I wanted a board that had a more boutique quality without the boutique price and it fits perfectly. The design is smart and practical, the ATA case is very high-quality, and it looks nice and clean. I love having the 1/4" jacks on the side, and the design allows a lot of customization. The only problem I've had is that cutting your own cables is a must with a board like this. Not an issue for me, as I prefer this way, but cable management can be difficult with boards that don't have much by way of routing underneath the board. However, pedal placement is only limited to how much you can fit on the board and the lack of holes or slits leaves no empty space and pedal placement is exactly how I like it.
Great product!                
I really like this pedalboard.  The road case is tough with padding inside to protect your pedals.  The latches are sturdy and lock it tight.  I needed to grab a smaller board to replace my very much loved SKB PS-45 pedalboard but it was time for me to upgrade so I chose this.  Another thank you to zZounds for their play as you pay plans.                
What else can I say except I'm having no issues with my purchase of my Blue Baby Bottle SL Cardioid Condenser microphone. It performs just fine in and around my sound studio. Would purchase a second and a third one in good time and do recommend to both friends in the industry and other new and up coming music producers alike. A great microphone and great value.                
I really like Blue BabyBottle SL, one reason is the sensitivity level. This mic can hear!
Also the presence on vocals is outstanding!                
I got these on the buy one get one free sale. One of them was defective and did not work. The other was fine. I used it on guitar and it sounded great. I have to return the other, hopefully they will not be the kind of mics you can't look at without jacking up.                
I've had a history with Blue Microphones, and this one did not disappoint. The price point is fair for almost any home studio budget, and the sound quality cannot be matched at that price. Would recommend for anybody looking to record alto male vocals, female vocals, or acoustic guitar.                
I have a stedman pro screen XL pop filter. I used to have the original Blue Spark and it was good no problems but even with my $50 pop filter there are still plosives on the SL version you definitely need a nylon pop filter. As for the sound its a bit harsh and grainy buy you get what you pay for.                
Zzounds sold me the Bose All I can say is wooow The L1 is great..Support  from Zzound and Bose .com are great ..They help setup my system up and any addons..all the heavy speakers are in the past..Go in setup in a flash..You will love them....sooner or later we all get older these things are a no pole speaker and lighter                
It Sounds good but I think you must use at least 4 to get a deeper bass sound.                
Just because is small and looks great, and works with the L1 systems from Bose.                
Just plug it and turn up the volume, and that's it.                
Well Done.                
It Worth the price but you have to spend $1300.00 to use 4 and get that real bass sound.                
I don't need it yet.                
I own it!                
I don't know yet.                
first of all my experience with z z sound has been great. I have several Bose system, after purchasing the Bose b2 base module. it has taken my bose compac L1 one system to another level of sound for portable system. if you are familiar with Bose sound system you know  It's a sound like no other. I am a karaoke and video DJ in the Greater Cleveland area.                
BOSE B2 IS VERY EASY TO USE "10" IT IS A PERFECT IMPACT OF BEAT TO THE DANCE FLOOR!!! "10"  I REALLY RECOMMEND AND A MUST HAVE BASS FOR YOUR L1 SPEAKERS!!! I RATED THIS PRODUCTS "10"!!!  SOUNDS SUPER GREAT SOUNDS AND VERY CLEAR, CLEAN AND PROFESSIONAL!!! NOW IT'S TIME TO UP GRADE YOUR SOUND SYSTEMS TO L1 BOSE B2 MODULE!!!  WHY WORK HARD WITH BIG SPEAKERS? TIME TO WORK SMART WITH PROFESSIONAL SMART SPEAKERS!!!!!                  
use this to dj love the sound and no more busting my back lifting 18 inch sub                 
Not quite sure what I expected from these speakers, but I certainly didn't expect this:
*Excellent bass
*Decent highs
*Comparable to a super-sized BOSE SOUNDLINK MINI ii
Due to their compact size, I was completely suprised at the overall performance of these  speakers. A definite WOW FACTOR! With the convienent payment options and super fast  (and free) shipping from zZounds, this was one of the most hassle free purchases I have made on line!
I bought these because of the Bose Name. When I hooked them up, which by the way is so easy, the sound wowed me! True sound that really fills the entire room. No matter where in the room I am the sound is the same as if I'm sitting in front of them. The bass is as it should be, pounding. The highs and mids are great. 1 would at first look say no way could these speakers for their size deliver such incredible sound. But they do indeed surpass all expectations. Volume control is just a simple twist of the pod wheel. It has hookups for headphones and another audio device. But I have no need for them as of yet. I use these for all of my laptop uses. News, Videos, Music, and most of all my DAW programs. I should of bought these sooner, had I known how good they really sound. And what makes this so affordable is the 4 monthly payments that zzounds offers. Have not needed manufacturer support. But do register them at the Bose website. All in all a best buy and worth every penny.                
I'm very pleased with this purchase. I've owned them for 22 days now and feel as if I've had them for a longer time. The small speakers pack a very grand punch, sounding like larger sized traditional speakers.                
I would highly recommend these speakers. They are small enough for travel and give you just enough extra sound to really enjoy whatever it is you want to listen to.                 
I would Like to be able to write a positive review. However I was never able to try the speakers out as the cables connecting the unit were to short yo place where i wanted them. Contacted Bose & they said there was no cable available to move speakers farther apart. Would suggest this would be a good feature.                
I Purchaced The Bose L1 Model 1S with two B1 Bass Modules. The Sound Is Absolutely Awesome!! My Outside Shows Require A Little More Punch In The Bass. I Bought The Bose A1 Packlite Extended Bass Package And That Took Care Of That. As A Mobile DJ/KJ , I appreciate The Light Weight System That Can Produce High Volume Sounds And, With The Help Of The Tone-Match Engine, Keep The Tone Clear And Crisp. These Extension Packages Can Easily Be Daisy Chained For Even More Bass Punch!! I Will Definitely Buy Another One!!                
All I can say is wow!!!! I have ran all QSC powered including KW 181 and 152. I have Han two of the Bose L1 model 2 b2 subs and they did sound good but when I heard this dude it blew me away. I just bought one F1 will be adding another one. then I add the subs they are loud and smooth. The 12 inch bass sound good at low volume but when you turn it to 12 o'clock the bass is still deep and rich. Get one more, you  may not need subs but I love it you will feel it in your chest!!!!!!!                
I'm a singer songwriter that does solo acoustic gigs with tracks, My go to was the L1 for the past two years, i needed more low end, had QSC K10, which made me realize i needed more bottom end for my tracks, I wasnt so happy about the QSC. i ordered this F1 812 a couple of times, and cancelled the order, thinking its a front of house speaker, not a L1 behind the performer...welll. i'm here to tell you, Thats how i use it now, behind me about 2-3 feet, I've had it for a week, and every venue i've played in, i've had other musicians come up to see what the heck was coming out behind me, it sounded perfect, it had low end, it had high end, it sounded like there was a speaker at someones table 80ft away, and doing that without blowing the front tables next to stage out. 
This is an amazing speaker, I love it, NOW i want another one, I dont need the sub, but will probably get it for even bigger and better situations. 
As one musician said to me, you've now stepped up your game, you sound so pro now.  (this guy always says negative things, never compliments), 
The only negative is, they did not provide a slip cover for this, and after 2 uses it had scratches on the cabinet...not cool Bose, 1200 bucks and you cant provide a little bit of nylon wrap to protect it?????  But now i have to pay $139 in Jan 2016 to get one...                
Okay..got ..ordered this from ZZounds last week..it arrived in 24 hrs and I didn't even ask for rush delivery..got it out of the box..it worked ..Played a gig with it last night...I only had funds for the 812 speaker..want to get the sub to go with it because I heard it in a local music store and it is awesome..With that said, last night I used it on a speaker stand with my L1 B2 base on the other side...ran a line from my tone match to the 812...was playing with a small group..we do jazz & R&B..this thing impressed me..I was totally in awe of the sound...granted I had the sub on the L1 B2, but the 812 speaker itself was more than enough to fill the room,  which had a capacity of about 300 people....Many compliments on the sound from the folks in the crowd as well as the other musicians...I'm really glad I got this thing..if you need there extra head room for your performances this thing will do the job just fine..Add the sub and you'll REALLY get big sound, but for a good quality full rand PA, the 812 is very impressive...In full disclosure, as I mentioned, I did use my Bose Tone match mixer, which I'm sure contributed to the quality of the sound, but obviously any mixer would work and probably sound just as good..the Tone Match is just what I prefer to use..                
Really impressed by the full sound and the sharp vocals, This speaker truly reproduces the sound of the music, I have not cranked these up yet and nor will I likely, these speakers are ideal for a small venue such as a wedding, or church service, I was most impressed by the dynamics of this speaker at low volumes, and when I turned it up, it was remarkable that the sound was loud and absolutely smooth. When I started as a DJ I started with the BOSE 901's and then the 802's Music evolved and I went to folded horn designs from Klipsh, JBL, and Peavey, as horn speakers got smaller I have been favoring Peavey, and recently I have switched to powered speakers by EV, wanting to expand upon this I ventured back to Bose, and just as the BOSE 901's excited me all those years ago, I find myself once again elated by the sound of the BOSE F! 812!!!                
The sound is unbelievable. I could use it by itself and get great sound and great bass. But to use it with the F 1 sub is totally amazing                
High are so crisp they could cut, with a mid range punch that is amazing. Overall the sound from this cabinet is amazing. However at $1200, Bose should have provided a cover for free                
There is no way to simply describe just how good this speaker is. Whether as FOH with full bands or behind a solo/acoustic act in a small room, the F1 blows away everything else I have used in my 4000+ show career. Did a solo gig with it 2 feet behind my left shoulder at a pretty large bar venue last night and had nonstop compliments on the sound.The adjustable vertical dispersion is surprisingly effective and useful. The headroom and clarity are astounding. The frequency response, while typically high on the bright end like all Bose products, is rounded out by the 12" woofer. The horizontal pattern is wide enough, but tight enough to reject feedback even when using behind performers. Handles and works like a traditional active speaker, and projects forward better overall than the wider dispersion tower systems.I still have QSC, Fender and other systems in my arsenal but the F1 is my new standard go-to speaker.
I knocked off 1/2 a star on features as I feel there should be a way to lock the adjustable speakers for carrying/transport...otherwise, no complaints.                
This blows everything in it's class away. I have tested just about all of them This stood out. I purchases one speaker and one sub and planning on matching that when I get this set paid off It's worth every cent                
I really don't want you to sound as good as I do but I just have to rave about the new Bose F1. I am already a Bose L1 user. This knocks it out of the park. One unit does the job of 5 separate units. Wish it had an extra XLR input, but it's an easy workaround with a splitter. Great sound for my particular voice range and my music. DJ's might be advised to buy the sub bass, but for me it's perfect. You will need to buy an expensive case if you travel, as it is easily dented. (Just like the L1) All in all a great buy for a small club or singer/ songwriter.                
Disclaimer** I do not work for or get paid by Bose, this is my unbiased review**
Over the last 15 years, I have owned most brands of top speakers from inexpensive to high-end. This is my first Bose speaker purchase ever. 
 With the Bose F1 being a linear powered speaker, expectations were met with high's clear and a long sound headroom. I used the pair of F1's first time last week with 2 separate weddings. 
First wedding had 120 guests in a 3k s.f. room with F1 tops on regular speaker tripod poles placed 30ft. apart from each other. Music playlist: hip-hop. Volume setting on Bose F1 only at 50%, seven hours later, not once clipped, only needed one 18" powered bass cube to help with the 12" speakers that are built in the Bose F1. Noticed immediately that across room at 60ft sound level was still right and had maybe another 30ft. of throw with minimal distortion! Was a little concerned breaking the 12" speaker in, playing hip-hop for most of seven hours. The F1's easily made it seven hours without a single clip. Not one guest asked to turn up the volume. 
Second wedding, next day, 90 people, 1k s.f. room. seven hours, F1 tops only on regular pole type speaker tripods. Set-up 40ft. apart in corners of room angled 90 degrees between walls that made corner. Music playlist was 60's-2000's dance music. Volume on speaker was 50%, no bass cube or extra speaker needed for a room this size! Again, did not clip. 
Final words, great speaker, construction build, and value. Only thing I would like to see changed is the handle design. I know it's hard to place handles in a box crammed with speakers and amps, but for a mobile wedding DJ, it takes a few times to figure good "lift" points, trying not to drop it when lifting on a pole mount above your head. Not the easiest to do unless you place one hand on the front grill in corner only. If you try to lift in middle of grill, the entire middle grill pushes in and I didn't want to take chance of breaking that. Only concern now is how the front grill corners will look after this wedding season. And maybe Bose partner with road case company because I can't find hard cases for the F1's, still using boxes they were shipped in as my cases until I make some later on.                 
I used to swear by my qsc k12s. I already owned four of the F1 subs so when these went on sale l bought two. These F1 tops left my k12s in the dust. I am going to buy two more as soon as funds become available.                
The Bose F1 is simply incredible, it was alot of money for me so I took my time ready reviews, ect. Finally decided to get the them with the sub, awesome...                
These speakers are by far one of if not the best compact small to medium venue, portable sound system you can buy. The sound  is superb and the amount of power that this system churns out is breath taking!  The subs are even designed to interlock with another sub for additional reinforcement. Definitely worth buying a second set.                
I bought this thing for my tv room! I use it for mixing from cdj's - streaming from iphone, whatever I want - I also use to watch movies - this is the only speaker you ever need it -                
Wow!!! What can I say?? Bose you have done it again!!! I am very very impressed with my new system!! And would highly recommend anyone to get it!! Will be ordering another set soon!!                
Perfection.  Life like reproduction,  with excellent vocal clarity.                
Variety of in/outputs is nice.  Adjustable array is a plus.                
No learning curve at all, it sounds great and is simple to use.  If you have been using Bose in the past, this will impress you even more.                
Well made, but I would like the finish on the cabinet to be scuf resistant.  I think it will look well used in a month more of gigging.  It should ship with at least a protective cover.  My only complaint so far.                
It is getting me gigs and impressing people with a wow factor,  worth the price.                
No need to as of yet.                
It lets people hear what you are actually playing.  This speaker is like finally seeing clearly.  Like if you needed glasses but didn't know it.  Then you put them on and say "wow"   JBL can't do that.                
I own the Bose L1 compact and have been gigging with it for about six months with my mostly solo Americana style act(guitar, vocals, harmonica) as well as sometimes hosting jams with multiple musicians.  It was perfect for small venues, but when I got a gig at a larger venue (large hall) my compact could not fill the room.  I was hoping that adding the F1 812 would five me the power I needed to accept larger venue gigs.  I was also hoping to continue using my L1 compact on one side as a monitor and fill.  Well, it does the job perfectly. I ran the T1 tonematch into the F1 via the XLR input, then I daisy chained from the F1 to my compact via xlr to 1/4" TRTRS.The tonality of both systems matches perfectly... Still that clean Bose sound,  even fuller as I feel the F1 fills in the mids. I play the same large hall with this system and i have to say it absolutely fills the place with even clean sound.  I get compliments and genuine amazement from the audience at the purity of the sound.  Most recent comment was, "I think this is the first time I have listened to a system where the acoustic guitar actually sounds like an acoustic guitar."  I have other musicians trying to buy it off of me, but I am keeping it.  I now have a system that opens many more opportunities.  It excedes my expectations.                  
Amazing, as stated in original review. Absolutely amazing!                
I wouldn't say any of the features were least useful. All features have a distinct function, and make very distinct differences.                
Incredibly easy to get sound, plug and play easy! They have a variety of input options making them very versatile.                
This has been the only issue so far. Not many reviews out there on these. But I did have something happen to the input section of both inputs simultaneously. Working with customer service to get a new one.                
Based on how they sound and the versatility, they are at least worth most of the asking price. If I have more issues I will say no. Otherwise, yes. They are worth the asking price.                
Haven't used.                
The appeal is very high. Everyone's asks about them, and I'm always happy to show them off                
In 1 word, amazing. These things sound great in any application. I have only had the pair for a month and a half so far and I have had the pleasure of using them for many different applications. I have used them as my home theater, lined a Mic straight in and used them for presentations, I have dj'd at a bar and used them as my front of house for my band. They handle everything I throw at them with absolutely no issues. I have never had to turn them up past noon, and that would have been way to much for many of the uses I have for them. These will easily work for med to small bar gigs. They are quality built and you can clearly hear the difference as the amp adjusts to accommodate the flexible portion of the speakers. As well as when adding subs and utilizing the full range/with sub portion of the eq. The only issues I have had so far has been concerning the input 1 and 2. Something internally came loose and both inputs stopped sending a signal to the speakers. This, however, means that I now have to deal with zzounds customer service. And let me tell you about this experience so far, and this is actually what drove me to write this review in the first place....wow! When I called zzounds, it didn't even ring once and someone answered! They asked how they could help, and then when I told him what was wrong and the product I had just recently purchased, he asked if he was speaking with xxxxxxx and stated my name, and I hadn't even told him who I was. Based on what I told him, he was able to figure out who I was, what my email address was and confirmed within 3 min of being on the phone that I should get an email with everything I needed to return the defective speaker. He then proceeded to to thank me and my phone buzzed before I was even off the phone with the email he said I would get.....this is hands down the best purchasing experience I have ever had even if I got a defective product, assuming the new replacement shows up just as fast as the original did, which I'm sure it will!                
What can be said about BOSE?  You get what you pay for.  I am a wedding DJ and went through Mackie, Behringer, QVC, EV....even had an HK line array system.  Always looking for better and more portable.  As a mobile DJ I love being able to set up and tear down quickly.  My last rig was an L1 Model 1 with a 2B bass.  I was going to move up to an L1 Model 2 with dual 2B bass cabs, but the F1 came out.  The sound is AMAZING. I have ran this thing just on the edge of clipping for hours and it is so nice. Frank Sinatra at lower levels is superb and Usher maxed out is just as good. I bought two of these. The tops and bottoms, so close to 5K invested. One set is perfect for most every wedding, I bring both sets out for school dances and such. However, two sets, even pushing 4,000 watts can pretty easily get lost in a gym full of students. I am going to set them up higher at my next one. I have been asked to "turn it up" at a prom...but for weddings.....one set is so perfect. And you never really blast anyone out so bad that the venue is telling you to turn it down. And maxed out, it is CRYSTAL CLEAR. If you need to pound your dance floor into the ground, you may be better off with something more traditional...some 15's pole mounted on a pair of nasty subs.  But if QUALITY of sound is more important, you cannot go wrong with BOSE!!                
Overall these things are amazing right out of the box, even with out subs, the lows are decent. Going to add the subs very soon to go with! Worth every penny!                
I've been using the Bose L1 system for the past 2 years. Great DJ system. I decided to get the F series. I hooked it up , turned on the mixer, hit play, couldn't hear much. I turned up the volume on the speaker, then the trim level, then the master out level and the slider level.....i mean way up to equal the same volume as the L1 system. I'm NOT impressed with this F series at all. Your much better off getting the L1S1 system if you want a GREAT Bose unit.                
I purchased one 812 and 1 sub a little over a year ago for our church and I love them the sound is superior and setup is easy. We don't move them often but when I have to I love that they're super light and easy to set up. I was able to do away with all of our monitors and our platform is clutter-free and everybody can hear themselves. I'll be buying the other pair this year..                
Bose is known for quality and they didn't skip a beat on this one. Superb sound and quality. The best part of this whole transaction was the Distributor zZounds excellent customer service. I ordered the Subs on the weekend and expected delivery on their famous free 2-day shipping by the following Wednesday. Well, there was a communication breakdown at the distributor and the Subs didn't ship on Monday. I called to check on the subs because I needed them for a gig on Thursday. After expressing my discernment with the delay, David at zZounds understood my frustration and offered a satisfactory solution to the delivery issue. All I can say is that zZounds understands working musicians and our need for equipment when we need it! Congratulations zZounds!!! You have a loyal customer for life! Thank you and God bless you all!                
It's awesome never heard bass that deep and that powerful in a speaker that small                
Unparalleled sound from a sub of this size. The lows are so deep that you could never see the Sun. Definitely a system to get for small to medium venues.

The subwoofer does what it says it will do. Nice woofer for the price.The F series isn't one of Bose best systems.                
I have to admit, when it showed up and I saw how small it was I didn't think it would be loud enough. I play in an acoustic duo and my gig last night was at a bar that is legendary for being loud. For some reason,  the way the bar is set up, the patron' s talking volume gets very loud. Smaller PA systems I've tried to use struggle to combat the volume of the people there "yell talking" to each other haha. I've used bulky behringer 15" eurolive speakers and they work well there. I was tired of lugging around heavy speakers and stands. Trying to find a power source to plug both in etc...This bose l1 compact BLEW ME AWAY! I couldn't believe how well it filled the room with volume. We cranked it to an unbearable volume to just see if it would clip. We never got to the red clipping light. Had to back it off. We played in a noisy bar with around 40 to 50 people and the sound was great. It was crisp and clear no matter where you were sitting. It's almost as if the sound surrounds you. Unbelievable what this thing can accomplish for being so small. I needed 3 channels so I ran the right side output of my mixer to the right side line level 1/4 inch input of the L1. I panned all channels to the right. Ran the mixer main at noon and the L1 at around 11 o clock. It was perfect. At one point we ran mixer main to 3 o clock and L1 to 3 o clock. Not even a little blip of red on the "clip o meter". Hands down best desision to buy this.  Love it.                 
The Bose L1 Compact was purchased as a backup to my Bose L1 Model 1's I use for professional Dj use. It is lightweight and blends in with the decor.  It has ample power to keep up with it's big brother and is an awesome addition to my already amazing setup! Extremely portable and can be run off a A/C powerpack for remote sound. I have been a professional mobile Dj for 20+ years and this is the most clear and lightweight speaker in it's class! I really like it!!                
I have a room full of all kinds of different PA systems that I have purchased over the years. Now I am looking to sell most of it since I purchased the Bose L1 Compact PA System. None of the PA's come close to the sound quality that is produced by the Bose. Why pick up all those heavy PA's that I have when the Bose sounds better, easier to set up and is much lighter. I would advise anyone to purchase this PA.                
Super clean sound and no feed back! I run it with my Roland AC-60 for killer stereo. Much easier and versatile than the Tonematch engine. I can control the effects separately for vocals and guitar and mute all from the Boss foot switches hooked to the Roland. For a duo you would want two of them especially for high volume hard singing. I chose the L1 Compact over the Fishman 220 because of the 180 degree dispersion and lack of feedback annoyances. I play the ski resort hotels and it is perfect for about 100 people. Looks great too!!                
Love it!! Quality sound. As saying goes: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. The BOSE L1 is absolutely a keeper. I use itmy smart T.V. to enhance the sound or when I am just listening to music from the TV music channel or from the Ipad great sound. I plug in my electric acoustic guitar, karaoke and enjoy numerous nights of fun for the family/friends. Thanks ZZsounds for msking this a painless purchase. My next purchase will be the Bose microphone accessory kit. Watch out now. ..                
I regularly perform on the street and do small venue performing at coffee houses, parties, worship and others. I use it mostly with an acoustic guitar, vocal mic, and loop pedal. I am really impressed with the output of this small system. I recently used it at a park when we were doing an outreach event. I used it to perform music outside for a large crowd, using a portable power source it lasted me 3+ hours and could have probably ran for at least another hour. Because I use a loop pedal I was initially really worried about feedback and sound bleeding into the mic because the L1 was behind me, but I have had no issues with it. I have gotten lots of great feedback about the sound quality.                
A buddy of mine brought one over for a backyard party. After listening to it outside, I was pretty amazed at how much crystal clear sound came out of this. We did some Karaoke and played a lot of MP3's. And helping him break it down and carry it to his car trunk, I was sold. Ordered mine the day after. Would I use this for a huge gig? Well most likely "no", but for smaller venues, this thing puts out more than enough sound and again, if the source is good, the sound is good. This thing is amazingly true and crystal clear, even at louder volumes. I am still pretty amazed at this system. I did not buy the Bose mixer, I just used a Behringer 1202FX, out the 1/4" mains and into the 1/8" "ipod" jack. Works like a champ..                
I bought two L1 portables as stereo keyboard loud speakers. What amazes me is the accuracy of the sound reproduced by these speakers compaired to conventional PA speakers. I would put it on par more or less with the sound produced by studio monitors but at louder sound levels. What is even more amazing it how the speakers throw the sound around and make it seem as if its coming from everywhere, even when the speakers are turned away from you. What I've discovered with these things is that the volume is not so important as the sound seems to magically travel long distances. The sound color also remains the same no matter what distance you are from it. The only thing bad thing I see with these loud speakers is a certain boomyness in the mid low section, somethng that I was able to fix with a little eq.                
Bose uses plastic for these entry level PAs. Their other models use metal. But they seem to be well made and sturdy nonetheless.                
$899 for this kind of amazing sound in a compact and elegant design, not to mention the sound which is the most important is worth every penny. I dont think anything out there compares with these compacts.                
The sound is fantastic. It's clean and loud and sounds the same no matter where you're standing or sitting in the room. Unbelievable!                
I love how simple this system is. I only wish I had the ToneMatch accessory to go with it as I could then adjust the volume without have to get up or bend over. And that will also allow me to add some reverb as well.                
Simple and COMPACT. This thing effortlessly fits in the trunk of my Yaris with my guitar and luggage.                
I wish it was cheaper, but you get what you pay for! This is still a good deal compared to what it would cost to get anything comparable.                
This system makes people's jaw drop. They cannot believe that much sound is coming out of that little array. It's hard to stay humble about it.                
I love it. I plan to buy the ToneMatch accessory and use it to chain a second L1 Compact for even larger venues. Although this unit is PERFECT for any coffeehouse, restaurant, or venue seating less than 100.                
I make my living as a singer/songwriter guitarist and vocalist in the Pittsburgh PA area. I bought this in Dec 2016. As of this review I've used the Compact for 21 performances. Initially it sounded bass-y and scooped (lacking mids) to my ears. The highs and lows ring beautifully but in certain venues I miss the mids. I've been using a Fishman SA220 since 2013 with great success. It is a fantastic system and probably the best value in its class considering, price, tone, easy setup/tear down, and built in features. The Fishman SA also has a very well balanced and warm tone. However, in late 2015 I had to send the control panel of the SA back to Fishman to be serviced. Channel one cut out during a performance. Turns out, in my experience that the control panel in the SA220 has a somewhat recurring issue with dirty pots that need to be cleared with compressed air occasionally. Anyway, that is what led me to try the Bose Compact. As a minimalist, I absolutely love the simplicity of the L1 Compact. It is a very straight forward system without any bells and whistles in the EQ/Effects dept. Ive been very used to the tone of the Fishman after using it for so long, so Ive been considering sending the L1 back to zZounds but I have finally come to terms with this realization: Although they sound very different, both the Bose L1 Compact and the Fishman SA220 are exceptional systems for a solo performer. The dispersion of sound produced by the L1 Compact is truly amazing. I've used it in large rooms, small rooms, some with tiles floors some with carpeting. It does really well every time. I've used a Strat, Taylor T5Z, and a Martin through it and they all sound great. If more EQ than what your guitar offers or having on-board effects are important to you then I'd suggest using an additional mixer of some type. Personally, I don't use reverb on my voice in most live situations, so I don't miss it. As far as instrument effects go, I use a few pedals on a pedaltrain. In a noisy bar I think I'd prefer the Fishman SA because it clearly has more OOMPH but when playing to an audience that is there to listen to the performance the Compact will shine even in a fairly large room. I'm not able to comment on using it outdoors because I won't get a chance to do that until later in the year. Time will tell how it holds up under a heavy performance schedule. I'm hoping it will not ever fail due to dust/dirt inside the pots like the control board on the SA has done more than once. Im not knocking the Fishman, its a great system, its just frustrating to need to clean out the board occasionally.I'd also like to ad, I have no idea what the saying " No Highs, No Lows, Must be Bose" is based on. The L1 Compact has clear crisp highs and very good lows for a solo performing singer/songwriter with a guitar. If anything, as I mentioned earlier, it lacks mids. Perhaps the highs and lows thing refers to the larger systems or maybe to consumers trying to use the unit in ways other than it was intended.I rated it as a 4 but only due to the fact that in its price range it offers less EQ and on-board effects than competitors. Overall:The L1 Compact: Beautifully minimalist, Sleek, stylish, great sound, more than adequate bass for a solo guitarist/vocalist, a dream to set up and tear down, seems very durable, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is seeking simplicity, great sound, and who doesn't want to put heavy boxes up on speaker stands: ) Cheers                
This Bose system is just awesome. I use it at a gym facility for classes as well as background music. The sound quality is top notch and the volume is WAY more than needed. I had thought about supplementing a separate sub to enhance the lower end, but have not really needed to. The acoustics in the gym works well enough. I still may add a sub, as sometimes we do conduct classes outside because of capacity limitations, and the low end is not heard (or felt) as well outside. 
The sound quality so impressed our gym members, that some of them are considered buying their own for their own purposes. 
I rated the Manufacturer Support as 1 star, because I have not needed to use it, therefore I can't rate it.
For some people, the cost might be on the high side. The sound quality, the ease of use, and the versatility makes it worth the cost. If you're looking for a system that is very portable, flexible, and want the quality of sound that only Bose can deliver, then you'll be happy with L1 Compact.                
I've owned four other personal PA systems made by other manufacturers, and this is by far the best. Clear sound, lightweight, small footprint, minimal cords, visually pleasing. Thank you, Bose and Zzounds. And Zounds, thanks also for your Play as You Pay program.                
I've been wanting a nice, compact speaker system I can use for wedding ceremonies, cocktail hours and if the event is small, use them for the whole gig so I decided on the L1 compacts.I purchased two of them and so far have been amazed at the power they deliver. Not really sure about the watts but honestly, they sound amazing. I will be adding a separate bass as I love my low end. While these two have a decent low end, it's just not enough for some hard hitting bass.With that said, I used them at a small venue with about 100 people and they really sounded amazing. I also used 1 for a ceremony due to cable restrictions and that one sounded great for both the officiant and music. If you have the cash and like an elegant look, go for it. I'm still going to add a bass though or just use one of my Mackie 15' thumps for low end.                
This is the best sounding Bose live sound speakers I've heard to date. I did an RTA and revealed its response is fairly neutral, with a light mid high boost to bring out the presence. Microphone does not sound boomy, as the mic input has some EQ applied. The microphone doesn't feed back, even with a SM-58 mic, gain at 1 o'clock, standing 2 ft right in front of the speaker column. The music material sounds punchy, more so than the size of the sub might suggest. The sound quality is on-par with JBL-PRX and QSC powered speakers, just not in terms of output level. You will not find a better sounding integrated system for less than a grand.                
Setup is extremely fast: no poles, no speaker cables, patch cables between amplifier and mixer. Just your instruments/mic and 1 power cord. The modular design allows 3 different speaker heights, depending on how many spacer column you use. When the whole thing is set up, it only takes up a very small footprint: smaller area than a tripod mic stand would occupy. Works very well in tight venues like coffee shop and small classroom.                
It doesn't require a professional sound engineer to make things sound good with this system. Bose did the hard work; you just need to control your volume. 
Everything packs together into 2 light hand-carry stowages. I don't think there is a system out there with a faster setup and easier transporting package.                 
Build quality is top-notched, not a typical made-in-china appearance.                
Everything integrated in a convenient good sounding system for less than a grand. That's quite a value.                
Have not need to use Bose support yet. So can't comment.                
I own it. It has enough appeal to make me want to use it more than I need to use it. The clever design and good build quality does not turn off users like some other cheap products.                
Bose really exercised their product bases to put together this integrated system that makes sense and suits the need of many solo or duo bands. They did it right this time, with a small array at top that projects good distance at useful output levels, with a good gain-before-feedback. You don't need a full-length array for a small system like this. This system will not service a 500-people crowd, nor should it. It has its place.                
Have seen and played with band users of the Bose L1 System and looked forward to getting one.  I was shopping by price so when the system was 10% off I purchased it, adding the tone module since I intend to use it primarily in a guitar/vocal setting.  I was disappointed to discover the tone module required a proprietary power supply.  I went back through the on-line information both from ZZounds and Bose; neither warned me of the requirement.  I did find a user review (after purchase) that had that information.  I think the requirements should be clearly indicated; if the compact system was not designed to be used with the tone module (which the lack of an on-board power supply indicates) then the need and cost of the power supply should be noted.                
I will start by saying I normally am not a fan of Bose...and that is downplaying it. They make decent stuff, but usually you can do better for less money. I have owned QSC K12's recently, amongst many other PA items over the years. But I wanted something for personal type use, for my keyboard, etc... There is no product similar to this piece, so I tried it. There is some dialing in on EQ I had to do, but with my Motif XF8 it was easy. It is fairly amazing that it can disperse the sound so well from a single point. Yes, it is still sort of expensive, but when I take into consideration all the large items I have to carry already, it was the perfect product. I will also say that my first unit came in damaged, and it appears it was a defect off the line. ZZounds went WAY above to help me out since I needed it for a gig. And that is why I will continue to buy from them as I have for a while.                
Most of my music is played through a loop pedal.  I do a lot of beatboxing, vocal  harmonies, and percussion on the guitar. The L1 compact handles this very well.  I have used it to perform for audiences up to 200 people. I have used it outside for parties and events and busking. I've had mine just over a year and have had 0 problems with it.  I highly recommend this system.  I am very happy with my L1 compact.                 
This is by far, the best PA out there. I purchased the T1 ToneMatch Audio Engine Mixer as well. I sing at Senior Centers and Nursing Homes. The sound is clear, clean without fatigueing the listeners. No matter where they are in the room, the systems delivers the same crisp, clear sound that is comfortable to everyone.
As a performer, I absolutely need to be able to hear myself and I can anywhere in the room. What I am putting out to the listner is the same sound I hear myself. I no longer need a monitor of any kind.
Used Bose tech support to get going and they are excellent. The purchase from ZZ Sounds is always smooth and effortless. Not to mention the payment plan.
A very satisified customer indeed.
This system is perfect for my company!  DC2DW DVDJ Entertainment has found the perfect sound with these speakers.  This was my third one and I just order my 4th one!!!  I love the way the sound and my customers are always amazed when I set them up and turn them!!!!  The Ultimate Sound!!!                
I have been singing in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and churches for over 12 years, and this is the 4th system I have used. It is by far the best and lightest, and I would recommend it for any similar situation. I received it on a Tuesday morning, tried it, and used it that afternoon for a program. Everything worked great! I use it about 17 times each month. (I haven't had to use any manufacturer support so can't tell about that)                
Having used this product with the L1 and B2 bass module I was already familiar with the product. I needed one for our Karoake group that I could carry to the member performers' homes. I got this system and it sounds fantastic!!!! It is worth every penny and more! The staff at ZZounds is just excellent. Very professional to deal with, courteous and knowledgeable. They even got me the 4 pay credit arrangement that I was not aware of and the entire transaction was smooth. You even get a monthly reminder for the payment being taken from the credit card so there are no surprises!!!! Just overall an A+ company, product and staff!!! I have also recommended this product to any of our Karaoke group members who is interested in owning and they are all sold on the idea after listening to the sound!!!                
The Bose L1 system is absolutely perfect for my acoustic duo. We also use some recorded tracks, and the system handles the bass & drums flawlessly! True Bose ambience! Thank you ZZounds for making it easy with 12 payments!                
Great sound. I hear it in my performances but more importantly from the response from my audiences. A must for singers, keys etc. soloist                
I've used the L1 Portable on five gigs since purchasing it three weeks ago. I love it's compact portability and the quick setup. I've received numerous positive comments about how great the sound output is. I wish I'd purchased it earlier.                
I bought this Pa system a few months ago after exhausting research done on many systems/combo systems..I'm a jazz guitarist that needed a small, but high quality system for banquet halls, reatuarants, etc..I use backing tracks through my laptop, but then sometimes play with a bass player, keyboardist and drummer..I'm extremely pleased with the quality of sound this thing puts out...it is exactly what i wanted...I do use a small powered monitor off to the side( 12in. speaker)...but only when playing larger rooms..everyone is impressed with the sound ...I currently use a small mixer for my running my electric and nylon string guitars through...jeyboards added and synth drums when a drummer is present...it handle all of this very well...I will say, though that if you find yourself playing for in a larger room and find that you need to crank the volume really high..it will clip...as i'm sure any system would...so when Bose says for audiences up to 100 people I've found that to be an accurate statement..I have a friend with the next level up system and we've played together for events, combine the 2 systems and it sounded fabulous...I'd replace this system immediately if something happened to it...there is a place here in the city that deals with used Pa equipment...they tell me they've NEVER had any of the array systems from Bose in for repairs...It's awesome...I suggest buying it.                
Great sound for small to medium venues for my Karaoke shows, and set-up time has been decreased by 65%.                
great product sounds just as good as 2 srm 450 mackies                
This System is awesome. Going to get  the bigger system soon. Love it!                
I am by no means a professional musician but like many of us out there who like to jam with other friends or occasionally play a small gig in front of an audience, this is certainly the way to go. Very impressed with the sound and power and the ability to store it in a small space. I added the ToneMatch to my system which I highly recommend. I use both electric and acoustic guitars along with singing and the ToneMatch makes it all come together with great sound. I recommend this as there should be more inputs on the actual Bose L1 system. Never would have thought so much sound would come out of a speaker system like this does.                
Great sound system for small and medium venues. Easy to set up and a pleasure to carry due to light weight. Sets up in about 5 minutes. Yes, It's that easy. Sound is full and clear. Makes the guitar sing and voice not muddy. I will be adding on to this system with more Bose equipment.                 
Well, I reviewed this unit once already but need to do it again.  After comparing it numerous times side by side with the Fishman SA 220 I've decided to send the L1 Compact back.  It sounds good and is really nice to set up and tear down.  The highs are crisp and clean and the lows are very good for acoustic guitar.  However, it lacks the warmth in the tone that I hear in the Fishman system and also is not nearly as powerful at projecting sound as the SA220.  Ultimately, I decided it was too much $ to spend on a specialty unit for small/up close venues.  In my experience the Fishman SA can do everything the L1 Compact can do and more.
Great product for what it is, but not for me.
zZounds is absolutely fantastic for their great customer service, fast shipping and Play as You Pay program!                
I like the sound on this amp and it is only about half as heavy as my old amp                
The Bose system rocks  all my guys luv it.  Clear as a Bell.....with no Monitors. Bought the compact to add to my existing L1 system for larger gigs.  The big L1 goes up front and the Baby is used for Monitors.....GR8 combination.                
I'm part of a trio that consists of two guitarists and a bass plus a drum machine. Our audiences are generally under 100 people and the Bose L1 works great for what we do. We got it because we were tired of moving 70 lbs JBL cabinets and stands. We use a 12 channel powered mixer and run a line level signal to the bose. Because the mixer is powered, we could add the additional speakers for a larger venue in addition to the bose if it were necessary. But we don't anticipate a need for that just now. I do recommend using a mixer with some effects, I find plugging directly into the bose to be a little plain sounding. Quite pleased overall.                
I should have not expected anything less. Vocals are incredible. Power is just right for what I need. Very easy to use and very compact.                
Excellent sound! very clean with a nice bass punch so light weight easy to set up perfect for smaller venues                
Sound was great.                
Easy thing to setup ever!!                
A five year old could do the setup for you. No need to get a crew to do something small. Easy, portability, and no large vehicle needed to carry it.                
Great quality. Built solid, but not heavy. Looks great.                
For the amount of money I wouldn't suggest it if you are doing something "big". If you do small get together, stand out in front of buildings and give speeches, or play on the corner, and small outdoor events it's great.                
No need                
Only in a small area was the WOW factor present.                
The sound was good but not enough "boom" I like heavy bass without Bose's other components it wasn't loud enough. If you are looking to do a small outdoor event, For a presentation the simple setup is perfect. For me it didn't have enough Shake rattle and roll.                
Its simple and easy to use, sounds great! Thanks ZZounds for making my first Bose system affordable                
This is the go to system for solo acoustic acts.  It's light, easy to set up and it sounds great.  I also use it with a mixer when I need more channels.  Ideally, I think it works better alone with a guitar and mic.  The only problem I have with it is that it feeds back pretty much all of the time.  I often play small rooms where I am wedged in a corner and it's hard to not stand in front of the unit.  If I can have it out to the side there are no feedback problems.  It also serves well as a monitor for my band.  I played a loud room the other night with a trio and volume was a bit of a problem.  If I tried to turn up the volume it fed back.  It is also a bit pricy in my opinion.  That being said I would definitely recommend this system if you have the cash                
Plug it in, and you are ready to go.                
After reading all the great reviews.. a few by fellow DJ's I was totally stoked to get my new BOSE L1 Compact system,,.. after getting and trying it out I couldn't be more disappointed.. its going back tomorrow.. This unit sucks playing music.. No High, No Lows.. all Middle.. I am not paying another $400+ for the Tone Match system to make it work right.. I picked up the LD Systems MAUI 5 Ultra-Portable Column PA System several months ago and just did a side by side comparison with its BOSE cousin... the MAUI 5 wipes its rear with the BOSE L1... not even close.  I am getting a second MAUI 5                
good sound over priced needs built effects line outs separate from each channel, very under powered, if i could do it all over i would go for the again over priced li sys for more power                
Our company initially purchased six of these for presentation media audio support, corporate presentations, small venue music playback & portable audio.  Compared to most of the "speakers on a stick" (JBL Eon, Mackies, et. al.) they are easy to set up, sound reasonably well for speech but absolutely suck for music playback.  We've liked the appearance of this and the Sennheiser K Arrays but audio quality and $$$ has been disappointing.  On our trip down to NAMM earlier this year we saw a new German company, LD Systems and their Maui series speakers that absolutely blew us away!  Better bass, true mid/high response and less $$ than either.  If our fleet of JBL Eons could last another season we wouldn't be shopping so intensely but from what we've heard Bose will not be in our future.                
The sound quality is pretty good. Its nice and clear. Loud. I just wish it had a little more bass. I used this system for a small DJ gig. I think the sound is great for a small house party (indoors). If your looking for something with a little more power and bass I'd recommend the Bose L1 Model I System Single Bass Package. I'd recommend this particular speaker for a guitar or any other live instrument. I would not recommend this speaker for a DJ gigging at large venues. This is more for a smaller DJ gig or maybe even better used as practice speakers.                 
The product included carrying cases!                
This speaker is very easy to use. The best part is how easy it is to put the speaker together and to take it apart. It's super light. Its powered so thats another great thing about it. Its super simple and to the point when it come to connecting a guitar or a mixer or for most instruments for that matter.                
The product is high quality which you can expect from most if not all Bose products. Very dependable, feels sturdy. I think this product would be good for traveling. It's very compact and easy to carry around. It's super light also. Seems like it'll last a long time.                
Yes it's definitely worth the money!                
Haven't had to deal with support so that's a good thing !                
It's pretty sexy ;) very nice design i must say.                
I would keep this speaker but I would also want to have something a little more powerful for DJ gigs. More bass specifically. You can never have enough bass when it comes to spinning records. But i think this is a great speaker for live instruments as well as a great clear quality practice speaker for todays DJ.                
I ordered this not knowing what to expect. It works great for the events that I DJ at. Majority of my events are weddings. It sounds great and will get loud. Works great in spreading out the sound throughout an entire area. I was worried if it would put out enough bass with the (2) additional bass modules. It has done more than I expected. Most important of them all....it is easy to set up and less to carry around than your traditional speakers. Can set up in less than 5 minutes straight out of the protective carrying bag that BOSE sends with this product. You will not regret ordering this system. The cost is high but it is well worth it. I ordered it on a Monday and received the entire system on a Thursday and was playing at my first event on a Friday Night. I left my traditional PEAVEY system at home and have not used it since. That was over a month ago. I still like my PEAVEY System but I will use my BOSE System wherever and whenever I can. Thank You zZounds!                
I love this system switching from my QSC to several Bose L1 model II B2 systems the sound and bass  thumps get the power pack. My customers love my sound and the sleek style of the bose system.                
I recently bought the L1 and the compact and use them together with the double bass pkg. On the advice of a friend I passed on the Tone Match engine and intead bought a small passive mixer. I have a five piece band with drummer, bass, two electric guitars and acoustic. I was really skeptical that the system would have enough punch to cut thru all the noise on stage. I've been hauling around tons of equipment for years and finally decided to give it a try. I couldn't be happier. No you're not going to play a stadium with this system but so far I've never been dissapointed. We've played rodeo dances and fairly large outdoor venues without a problem. Our set up and sound check time is a third of what it used to be and we no longer have to use a trailer. Mission acomplished Bose! I don't know how you get so much sound out of such a small system! I'm very pleased and would highly reccomend it. My only complaint is that the cords for the bass units are too short...and they're very expensive to replace.                
Used the item outdoors for a wedding with about 150 people. The sound was easily better than any other PA system I've used in that situation. The LII's resistance to feedback really helped when micing people and made for a very natural sound.                 
T1 remote very extensive and helpful. Good sound and processing. Little bit of learning curve to use all the features, but it gets you up and running with minimal effort.                 
By far the easiest to move and quickest to set of any PA I've used.                
Everything was made very well and felt solid and well designed. You can tell they put alot of money into the engineering.                 
A little expensive, but totally worth it for a DJ who wants a simple and attractive setup, or for an idiot proof PA.                 
Haven't had to deal directly with Bose, but I was impressed by the solid design of the product.                
Very sexy PA.                
Overall this is a great product. The price is a little hard to swallow, but the value is really outstanding. It is a great investment.                 
I Have two of these towers now. Both from ZZounds.com. All I can say is WOW! I was skeptical at first. But after trying them together, they are amazing. I use one for my acoustic show (3pc with guitar, bass, conga drum, vocals) and its overkill, but crystal clear and amazing sound. 
I also DJ for different events as well as a 500 person capacity club. It meets all my needs other than I think I will add an extra B2 module or two for the club. Its plenty loud for the areas I play, however in a full club of that size the bass end gets soaked up and I'm playing mostly dance/club songs that require strong bass. 
I've used it with my rock band and it is great. We got rid of the monitors, other than our drummer who uses in-ear monitors, and thats just because he wants the personal mix. Again, it would be nice to have the extra sub when playing the big club, but for your midsized bars, these two systems are quite enough for a rock band. 
My only critique is no XLR inputs. I'd like to have the option to use XLR instead of 1/4" but no luck.
overall, this is an amazing product. Its pricey, but for anything else out there that offers what these towers offer, its very reasonably priced. No more 150# speakers to carry!!                 
After reading all the hoopla about the Bose L1 Model II with the new B2 bass module, I finally broke down and decided to give one a try(without the Tone Match Engine). I have never been too impressed with the specs on Bose speakers; in the past 35 years of playing music professionally, running sound and as a recording studio engineer, I have only used Bose as a "cheap" monitor reference while mastering in the studio. Bose are the speakers that I turn on to see how a master might sound in someone's car...
The L1 series II is really something that you need to actually hear to appriciate! I set up one tower in my recording studio's 25x40' acustically dead room, cranked up some music that had good punchy bass and drums and was amazed! This system is loud,  punchy and ultra clear. 
Since the dead room is used as a band rehersal space as well, I decided to use the L1 system as a single monitoring system for the three bands that use the space to practice for a couple weeks to see what the musicians thought about the system's performance. The bands are classic rock, world beat and Americana. To make a long story short: everyone is now scrambling to sell the PA systems that they currently have to purchase L1 series II systems.....That says a lot....These folks are serious musicians and many of them professionals. The main comments from the musicians was how clear the mix was, how smooth the highs were and the fact that no matter where they were in the room, the sound was the same. One comment to note from the rock drummer(and drum shop owner): "I can't believe the kick drum sound that is comming from that little system!" 
The new B2 bass module is impressive however, outside or larger (200+) indoor venues and / or needing to reset someone's pace maker via kick drum may require extra subwoofers in the rock world. FYI: the L1 tower can get loud enough to need to Mic. the drums in order for them to "keep up".
Some folks seem to think that the L1 array system is too expensive for what it is. Personally, given the 7' tower throwing sound from the floor up and the fact that the array really does throw sound nearly 180 degrees to the sides, I would think that it would cost more to stack and splay several speaker cabinets to cover the same acoustic space(not to mention the size difference;-)
Down side(not much to say here):
The input is TRS only. I would have hope for a XLR/TRS combo jack to avoid looking around for XLR to TRS adapters to plug in.
The fact the Bose does not use compression drivers or another from of tweeter in their design does mean that the highs(above ~12.5k) roll off pretty fast. However, I found that there is plenty is "sizzle" on the vocals and cymbals with a bit of  EQ tweaking not to care much about the highs not keeping up (spec wise) with other live speaker systems out there.
The L1 / B2 system that I received needed to have a firmware upgrade in order to take advantage of the B2's bass response switch. The upgrade requires the Tone Match engine to "talk" to the the power base. I guess I'm lucky that there was a local music store that happened to have one that I could use to upgrade with.
I plan to purchase one more L1 series II with the B2 module in the near future to use in a stereo live rig. I have not heard anything out there in the same price range that can compete with these arrays.                
I have many years in broadcasting, specifically radio and audio production. I am retired now and DJ/KJ on the weekends, and also sing in a classic rock band. I have been through *many* systems over the years, from Klipsch to EV, but like someone mentioned in another review, I too am scrambling to sell everything. The Bose L1 Model II system I bought has the T1 unit, and a B2 subwoofer. I use it twice a week for karaoke, once a month for weddings and parties, and twice a month for my band. The sound fills every corner of the room, even when playing outside it has the longest "throw" of anything I have used short of a flying array. The B2 bass module is pretty potent for its size, it works great for small venues, but if you want chest pounding bass for hip-hop, look for a powered 18" from one of the major manufacturers. The T1 mixer may be small, but Bose packed some good stuff in the box! Compression, EQ, modeling, USB sound, and more. I have been sailing with my L1 for several months now, and consider it to be one of the best purchases ever, and I will be adding a second L1 very soon. If you are on the fence about the investment on this system, I have two words of advice to give you... DO IT!                
This is my second L1 system, I had two L1s with 8 B1s and two packlite amps back in 2008 and it was really a great system but I had too many B-1s (8) to get the bass response I needed for my mobile DJ needs. Now with the B2 bass module I can get the sound I want with four bass modules and two L1s and two packlite amps. The sound is amazing and I always get compliments during each show I perform at. Everyone is just amazed at how it sounds and they see the name Bose and they say, "no wonder, its Bose".  Others say, "I have never seen a Bose setup like this before". This is an expensive system so be prepared to fork out a lot of money but if you like Bose as I do then the price doesn't matter.                
I am a previous owner of a L-I model I and model II systems. This setup with two B2s and a packlight amp sounds excellent if you need extra low end. The B2 is a huge improvement over the B1 bass module. Some people may complain that portability is lost because the cabinet is significantly larger and heavier but I say not!  The average person can carry one in each hand during setup and tear down. I've always been a Bose fan so to me this is an investment and definitely money well spent!!                
i spent a lot of time reading the Bose blogs before buying.  My objectives were better sound, less gear and quicker set-up times.  The sound quality is awesome, beyond my expectations!                 
I love this product! I travel and sing full time so I needed something compact with a big sound. That totally describes this product! It fits in my small car and puts out a sound you wouldn't believe. I'm a female, and sometimes I can't carry heavy equipment. I have no problem with this. It's lightweight and easy to fill up. It filled up a 500 seater auditorium WITH my band plugged in my board at only half volume. Amazing! I highly recommend it!                
What I mean by the title is that this system is excellent in sound and quality. But, for the price you can get better sounding speakers such as the QSCs. And after buying these I found that this is a heavy set up after all. Quick set up, but heavy.Be sure to get the SKB hard cases to protect this exspensive system.                
I'VE BEEN IN THE MUSIC GAME SINCE 1962 (YES I'M OLD SCHOOL) AND BUYING THE Bose L1 Model 1S with B1 Bass Module WAS  THE  FINEST PRODUCT THAT YOUR MONEY CAN BUY.  IT IS TRULY  AN AWAKENING TO HEAR WHAT THE AUDIENCE HEARS.  THE ONLY FAULT  THAT I CAN THINK OF IS, WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG... YOU WILL LOVE IT IF YOU ARE REALLY ANY MUSICIAN AT ALL. zZOUNDS MADE IT EASY  TO BE WITHIN MY GRASP WITH A 12 PAYMENT PLAN AND THEY SHIPPED FAST.  ALL I CAN ADD IS TO ACT NOW WHILE YOU CAN!
THANKS zZOUNDS. 
Hi, I am a female that collects music, videos and karaoke.  I dj for many events and purchasing Bose L1 have been the best decision I made.  Less carrying and storing my equipment.  I plan to purchase another set this year.  I recommend to get this speaker because you do not have to carry many speakers.  I feel good when people view and stare at my equipment.                  
I play in a band and DJ Wedding Receptions...the set up is easy and the sound is great. It's so clear I'm hearing parts of songs I never knew existed.                
I sold my old PA system, which was 4 peavey PR15 speakers and a Yamaha emx512 power mixer. I bought the L1S mostly for the mobility, its a pain to lug those peavey's everywhere. Anyway I then bought the Allen & Heath ZED 10FX mixer.I love this New setup! I do Karaoke Hosting and usually have crowds near 100. I only use 25% of this systems Capacity. For DJing I wouldn't get anymore than this, although I did buy another B1 sub. and it does make a difference.                
I've borrowed both the L1 and L1 S1 for my acoustic duo and these are really awesome.  Love the easy carry in and setup.  The L1S1 is definitely the better and worth the extra money in my opinion.  We play at venues as small as 60 people and up to easily 300 or more... even outdoors and this system kicks @ss.  Been in the business for 30 years, and I own PA stuff big enough to fill an auditorium, but the Bose stick is my PA of choice now! I'll be buying soon as I can sell off the big stuff.                
For my purposes the Bose L1/B1 Bass system has revolutionized my PA system. As an aging musician, no more lugging heavy speakers and monitors. Setup is incredibly fast and easy. I love Bose's technology that minimizes volume drop-off while filling the back corners of the room. I love hearing the room mix while worrying less about mic feedback. I'm saving my lunch money to get a matching module so to really fill a good size room.                
Total awesome!                
I've been a DJ for about 15 years now...and the sounds are the heart of the performance as far as I am concerned. People always  think the lights are what matters, or the hardware like turntables that make the DJ show amazing. I'm here to tell you, it's the sounds! This Bose product is the best speaker system I have ever purchased. From going from heavy 15" speakers to these is a huge change. They are so compact, easy to transport and loud as hell. They connect to almost anything as long as it has a 1/4" plug. I just had to get another one! I have a small Honda Civic, and I fit 2 of these systems comfortably. Every gig I get amazes people. "Is all that sound coming from that speaker?", they ask. And I answer with a big smile and say, "YES!" I LOVE IT!!                
For a number of years, I've been thinking about getting a Bose system. Because they are rather rare where I live, it's been difficult to get my hands (and ears) on one. I was able to listen to one at a local big box music retailer for just a few minutes and had the opportunity to work a mixer for a bit. That was a few months ago.So, in my email, a message from Zzounds comes along offering the 12 payment plan. Without hesitation, I decide to order a L1 1S with B2 Bass Module. Now, in the back of my mind my spider-sense was tingling... will it sound as good as I hope it will? Will my concerns about the "punch" and "highs/lows" be resolved? Well, the unit arrived quickly and a few days later I had the opportunity to try it out for a holiday party with karaoke.I have to say that I was literally blown away by the sound and quality of this set up! The venue was mid-sized and the throw was great. People in the back of the room could hear everything. While the karaoke singers were on stage, they could hear themselves without the need for a separate monitor and when I needed to kick up the volume for DJ music, the B2 sub gave me the kick I needed to get people dancing. The best part was the bar owner's expression when he saw what was providing all of that sound!The next week, I had another holiday party, this time with live music. Besides being a DJ, I perform as a one-man act with keys, horns and sing. This venue was larger and had about 150 people. Well, the Bose killed it!During this event, they needed to speak to the audience for about a half hour and the podium was on the other side of the room (about 75 feet away) Not once did anyone look at me with that "I can't hear him look..."While I still need to use this at a smaller weeding, I felt confident enough in what I've heard so far to write this review. If it keeps amazing me with it's versatility and sound quality, I'll be buying another identical set up next season.                
I bought the Bose L1 system to replace my 4 peavy speakers. It really amazes me as to how well the Bose system works. I have people telling me that it blows my old setup out of the water. Set up time is greatly reduced. Sound quality is great.  If you are worried about not having enough let me tell you there are no worries. 
As they say "You get what you pay for" if you can afford to buy this system I highly recommend it.                
I bought this just for my patio parties.  I went to the music store and got two different cables and addapter to plug into my iPhone 6 and play off of Pandora.  At first the sound was not good and I was worried.  When i used the large cable with the adaptor, it was amazing!!!!  I love it!!!!                
This thing has the goods my friends. I haven't seen anyone review this that plays heavier music so I had to put in my thoughts. The clearity and punch you get from this thing is rediculous and it works amazing right out of the box. The addition of the B2 to this just makes this thing purr... I have yet to use this live, but after dealing with too many egos I was more then happy to temperarly replace the members I cant find with this bad boy and a computer with canned tracks. Which may not sound very metal but its what I have to do to to get my music performed in this climate. This thing keeps up with my 5150 iii well and I can play at comfortable volumes which the fans will enjoy I'm pretty sure. Its plunty loud and doesnt feedback with vocal microphones which still impresses me everytime I turn it on. I love it and can't wait to get a second one. The only thing better then this is the L1 model 2 that my dad has but this one was just priced so great with Zzounds payment options ( which is the greatest thing to happen to musicians in a very long time) I had to go with it and I don't regret it at all. This site is why I'm able to own such great gear! Thank you so so much Zzounds! Try this out, you wont regret it!                
This is my very first Bose purchase and I must say, it is every bit amazing as they all say. It was a breeze to put together. Takes up very little space and sounds amazing! Zzounds is all amazing! Product cam win perfectly safe and in working condition straight out of the box. It arrived exactly when they said it would...even all the way here in Hawaii. The payment plans are the reason I could make this purchase possible. Thank you thank you a million times, thank you!!!                
Well, I bought two of these after hearing a demo at guitar center. This beast has everything I need for my sound system. I am mobile DJ just started, but I did want to go to the lower end speakers...I have Peavey speakers, two Peavey PV115D powered speaker and two Peavey PV118 passive subwoofer. These Peavey speaker have no match with my Bose system. I normally use my Bose in doors, and Peaveys for outdoors. Sound is perfect to me, I always Bose system at home. It is very expensive, but it is worth investing for a good quality sound.                 
The system is perfect for my needs                
The best clear sound I've heard in years. I was reluctant at first to jump in on ths system because of the price and smallness of the speakers, was worried about the loudness in a crowded bar or wedding venue. Did my homework, talked to a lot of people and made the decision and wish I would have done it sooner. The system is light, well cased, and is literally 10 minutes from playing a gig. As soon as this one is payed for I will upgrade and buy another. Haven't needed manufacturers support and the sound is the best, I used JBL and QSC and Peavey before, They are heavy and take up so much room. With the B2 Bass I will never go back.                
This is an awesome piece, I took it out of the box and set it up right away. The sound is impeccable and I would recommend this to anyone that does DJ or live performance. I'm going to use this mainly for weddings and some karaoke gigs. I haven't had to use the manufacturers support.                
I suffer from tinnitus and drive a lot for work, almost like a truck driver. The road noise eventually started making my tinnitus worse so I decided to give these a try. They keep everything quieter and when I want to listen to music at low volumes I can hear everything super clear.They are so comfortable I sometimes forget I'm wearing them and I feel like the sound is coming from the car speakers instead of the headphones.The only bad thing that I've been able to find is of course noise cancelling headphones have microphones that capture noise and produce a negative sound wave to cancel out the noise. But something weird is that when it's super windy outside and even with the windows closed, the wind still affects the headphones a little bit and creates a sudden noise. I wonder why this happens if the wind is not directly hitting the microphones.That happens just every now and then and I hope Bose fixes this issue in the next model.                
I felt I was taking a massive risk in buying these, ultra overpriced I felt. The worst that could happen would just be that I'd return them and survive it. 
But I like these too much to send them back. I got the silver ones, they look awesome. The sound is perfect, the noise cancellation is very powerful and the aesthetics are great, especially the silver one. They are very comfortable and flexible and have extremely convienent controls and the way the inside of the headphones have a huge R and L in it is really neat and helpful. It's so nice to have a bluetooth connection! That is extremely helpful in so many ways. 
I'd buy this if you both have the money and don't want to buy another pair of headphones or ear buds ever again. And if you fly a lot of have good reason to get noise cancellation, or just enjoy having it. I love zZounds for their payment plans, makes everything possible and reasonable. 
Be sure to get the Bose app straightaway for it. I will rarely ever use the voice function but it's neat to know I have it. I might get in the habit of using it in the future I imagine.
I'm sure the customer support is great but don't anticipate ever needing to contact them about anything. 
Again, everything is very, well, exquisite is the word. Extremely expensive, scary expensive but it is worth every penny in the end. I expect tremendous mileage out of these.                 
The dispersion of clear sound is amazing, the selectable mic or guitar ToneMatch settings help to cut thru the mix. Bluetooth sound has no EQ control just overall volume.                
Portability and onBoard ToneMatch with Reverb are the key features that got me. Bluetooth was a bonus.                
This unit is plug and play, or unplug and play, its that simple.                
Unit feels well made and sturdy. Rubber padding on cabinet for all three positions: Tabletop/Tiltback/Monitor. Knob pots are smooth. Top handle is solid, the whole look of the unit is Pro.                
Compared to other items with similar features, this speaker is way to expensive, But I personally feel its worth the price, for Portability, Reliability, Sound Quality, Manufactures Support aanndd it has a TRS LIne out.                
I had a problem with the red light flashing while I had the unit plugged in to outlet strip, looked at manual, no info, found a sticker that says flashing red means less than 10% battery life. Talked to Bose while driving to work. Advised Reset unit. In the end, I had been using it on battery power while plugged in because strip was OFF.                 
It Looks Pro, it Sounds Pro and it Feels Pro                
Gotta Have It.                
I just got delivery on the two Bose S1 Pro Units and am very pleased and true to Bose they deliver the sound for me every time Im use them. These little boxes are only 15 pounds but have the sound including low end of a much bigger box. I just ordered another one ! I just did the update also though the Bose web site so that you can use the Bose connect app to stream two together. Lightweight, powerful, full rich sound and great low end. The battery does what they say it does nd runs for hours .I ran it for about 4 hours first time with much more to spare.I have called Bose several times and they are quick and informative .That s one of the reasons I really like Bose .I use these for small Dj events and corporate they are great !                
First off, these are not only small and light, but easily the most powerful portable speakers I have used professionally. If you are a DJ these may just change your life! Gigging people everywhere, this will more than cover most shows with 100+ persons. The speakers are very versatile, I have used them for my guitar, directly in with the "ToneMatch" on guitar. Reverb is good and the EQ settings do assist getting a great sound. Phantom Power is not available on the unit, (the only mark missed in my opinion). My Shure SM 57 and 58's as well as the Sennhiesers 906e work well and sound clear as a bell. Singing and playing setup is very easy, as well as tearing down. I bought a Pair of Live sound Mini PA speaker stands to use these, the speakers are light and are a good fit you wont need the full size stands unless you want to get the speaker up high. They work good in the 3 positions they were designed for, and the EQ actually accommodates and changes for each change. I have used the BOSE Connect App to connect the speakers via Bluetooth in Stereo. I will let you know, that I did have to update the speakers to get this to work. The Bose site actually had this listed and the solution to resolve the issue. I have put actual distortion pedals into the speakers and it sounds well, the reverb and the ToneMatch give the sound of an amp! (very good sound with some tweaking) I love this setup for my OPEN Mic nights! I use one Bose S1,Two BOSS WL20 wireless systems, one Bogner Red Extacy Pedal and a Charvel San Dimas guitar. All battery, all wireless and all awesome. I am actually building more wireless options and rigs that have more versatility. I cannot rave enough about these incredible Speakers. Try one and see what you have been missing! I plan to but 4 more and replace my Huge PA Speakers with these. I can see the possibilities and so will you.                
I purchased this speaker for little reunions, listen to music, karaoke and it just sounds great. Clean sound, portable and very well built. Very happy with this speaker.                
My S1Pro was delivered 3 days ago and I cant believe something that light weight and small can deliver the sound quality I come to expect from BOSE. I love it. The sound is similar to my L1S1 towers. If you are looking for a true, quality practice system, this is it. I used it at band practice yesterday and the other guys couldnt believe what they were hearing. If I could give it 6 stars I would. The only drawback is there is no phantom power button for my shure 87 A mic. I needed to attach one of my tone matches to get the phantom power. Adding the seoerate tone match also increases the number of channels. At practice I had 3 mics, a guitar and a bass going through it at the same time and it was crystal clear.                
WOW! RIDICULOUS! IMPOSSIBLE! ... This pa is on another level. Remarkable engineering to get crisp, clear, powerful sounds from a speaker of this size and portability. Acoustic guitar and vocals are amazing! Dispersion is amazing as well. Buy it. You will not regret it. Thanks to zZounds for great service always!                
I bought this on a whim to try it out. It certainly has that "Bose" sound. Heavy bass, sometimes hard sounding highs but with decent midrange. You can tell it's heavily processed via EQ curve. I bought it mainly for a back yard Bluetooth speaker. In the upright position either on a table or stand, the bass is so forward that it distorts very easily even at mid volume with modern bass heavy music. Older 80s music is not an issue. IF it had a bass level on the Bluetooth input where you could dial it down, that my have helped. Unfortunately it does not. 
I find it funny how every on of the professional demos are acoustic guitar. It sounds great with that but put real world music through it and it disappoints. I suppose if you were using it in a PA system and were able to filter out the bass and send it to a subwoofer, it would work pretty good. 
Not sure if I'm keeping it. For $600 I expected more. I thought I may have gotten bit by the Bose bug but I think I'm just going to swat it away.                 
MAGNIFICO, EXTRAORDINARIO,VERSATIL, MUY MUY CHINGON !!!!!!!! thanks zzounds for the opportunity of financing !!!!!!awesome !!! 10 stars.for both .                
I am not a newcomer to pa systems small or medium sized.I fogured its a Bose so it will fill a room with good quality clean crisp sound.Well....in a small living room area with 20 people the volumes on the mixer were maxed out and it was not enough!Mike had no headroom. Ok it sounded ok but not sensational as the price tag would suggest.my Behringer 8" powered speaker and Behringer mixer have way more punch and volume......sent it back.....                
Excellent quality. Comes with a dust cover, battery pack and power cord. The sound is what makes or breaks this speaker. I would not use these for studio monitors or critical listening. I was playing some 24 bit HiRes AIFF files, and it could not keep up with a balanced frequency. I compared the Bose to different set of HiRes studio monitors. It gets the drum frequencies right, but it fails with ambience and vocals. You'll notice a big dip in the volume, as if you lowered a certain track during you're mixing. Very weird and disappointing. I found this speaker to sound phenomenal with YouTube videos and movies. Nice and smooth!. It just failed when it had to perform for my DAW. So confusing!. To conclude, my music is way too ambient for the Bose S1 Pro.. The Bose Acoustimas system sounds way better. I was just annoyed with a big sub bass under my desk and wires. When it comes to the S1 Pro,  I do see this more ideal for live instruments, video games and movies. I would not recommend for DAWs and music purist.                
I recently purchased one of these for my wife, pairing with her phone was very easy! The sound, in particular the bass was very surprising in it's punchiness and clarity. My wife loves this little speaker and uses it often! If you're looking for a small easy to use great sounding little speaker this Bose Soundlink Color 2 will not disappoint!                 
I own several Bose products,and this one is no different! Amazing sound ,easy hookup ,and very easy to program. Very satisfied! I will be buying more!                
This was a guilty pleasure purchase for me! The last thing I needed was another pair of bluetooth speakers! But, WOW! I am so glad I purchased these! They have replaced just about every pair of headphones and bluetooth speakers I own. I had no idea what I was going to use these for! But I wear them to work everyday and I wear them around the house when I'm doing chores. The sound quality is fantastic and the sound stage and imaging are outstanding as well! Get a pair, you won't regret it!                
I purchased two Bose SoundTouch 10's and a SoundTouch Wireless Link. I wanted to buy at least one of the larger Bose SoundTouch units for bigger, better sound. I was replacing a Nyne bluetooth and an ipod nano touch.Setup was simple once I downloaded the app on my phone and computer. I programmed my iTunes playlists in the six available presets fairly easily. The app could be a little simpler to operate (very simple on setup).But what blows me away is the sound quality, and beefy bass response, that you get out of this little speaker. It is easily half the size of what I replaced, but the sound quality is much better, and just as "big" if not bigger. If I was filling a larger space, I would definitely want the SoundTouch 20 or 30 units. But if you're holding off because you don't think the smallest of these speakers will get the job done, think again. After all, it is Bose.                
I absolutely love these earbuds! They have amazing sound quality! Deep lows, smooth midrange and airy highs! These buds sound almost like full size headphones! I also like the fact that these don't feel like they're going to fall out of my ears. I had a pair of Apple AirPods and these blow them away in every respect! And of course, zZounds made it easy to purchase these through their wonderful, "Pay-as-you-Play" program!                
Great cable. Soft, pliable casing prevents kinks and makes it easy to roll up and unroll while on the road. By the way, the cable is 18ft. Long. This spec seems to be missing in sales specifications.                
The clamp is made of plastic that breaks very easily even while being careful with it. The clamp adjusts to several sizes which is very well thought out. The problem is the material the clamp is made from.                
This is the shoddiest music accessory ever made. It's made of plastic, and after a couple of uses it will no longer fully clamp down. Shortly after that, it will break, allowing your $500 tonematch (also made of plastic) to fall to the stage. With all of Bose's innovations, one would think that their engineers could design a simple, METAL, reliable device for attaching the tonematch to the mic stand.                
Does exactly what it says. There is no hum on any channel like many other cheaply made A/B switches and LED indicators make it easy to quickly view the routing. Long battery life makes this sleek switch a winner.                
Seamless, silent switching.  No degradation of sound at all.                
Very basic and simple.  Does just exactly what it's meant for.                
Metal case, GT-6 switch, rubber,non-slip base, heavy, I don't think this unit could be constructed any better!                
A little pricey, but look at the quality and the silent switching circuitry.  I would gladly pay this much again!                
I'm guessing Boss is okay on support, I've never had to find out!                
I don't just want it, I need it.  I use a Fender Twin Reverb amp and use it for channel switching.                
Better than anything else out there for this purpose!                
It's silent, which is what it's supposed to be.                
Does one very simple thing and does it efficiently.                 
Plug in 3 cords, step on a switch. Can't be easier.                
Seems very sturdy. Very small, will take up no room on my board. Very Nice.                
$30 some dollars. Can't get better than that.                
Haven't needed it, doubt I will.                
It's kind of like a girl you've been dating a long time. You know where it's going to be and what it's going to do. You don't think of it as sexy, but it's nice to have around.                
It's simple and effective.                
This pedal has excellent sound. I love instead of turning off the Distortion and getting a hollow sounding clean electric, now I just hit the stompbox and it sounds like I just picked up my acoustic that's sitting in the corner (Which is just too far to consider).                
The preset modes are nice, the Piezo is my personal preference. The Top and Body tone knobs are effective and can greatly change your sound, and the Reverb function is high quality and useful.                
Standard Boss: Plug and play.                
Standard Boss Again: I'd imagine if I threw this pedal off of the roof it might break a knob off, but they pedal would still work. This pedal feels like a beast for its size.                
Never needed support.                
Overall I'd give this pedal a 9, only because you have to adjust it quite a bit if you plug into a new amp to get the perfect sound you want.                
Cheesy, unrealistic, failed for my tastes and purposes. Well made and durable, though. i owned it , and i was glad to sell it to a friend who liked it!                
Stereo inputs would've been nice, especially if one input would do well for electric basses. Too few controls!                
great construction, although the noise level was high for a Boss pedal.                
Sorry, but cheaper pedals blow this unit out of the water!                
n/a; I didn't contact Boss.                
I purchased this in the hope that it would be good enough to use for a couple of acoustic guitar parts on stage. I used a strat and tried it both direct to pa and through a guitar amp.  There is so much digital fizz in this thing I feel it is unusable.  The fizz seem related to the top control - if you turn it down the fizz goes away, but so does the acoustic tone. Too bad because under the fizz you can sort of hear promising acoustic tones..Maybe the AC4 will correct this problem, but I sent mine back.                   
I have a few amps. I play primarily acoustic & I lead worship. There are times where I'm just by myself & then sometimes I have a full band. 
This amp is great! The very 1st time I lead with it, I got compliments on how good sound was. It can really help bring the whole mix to life if used right. I wouldn't trade it for anything else on the market. Just make sure you pick up the GA-FC to utilize all the sweet functions this amp has built in. Last suggestion: don't go over the top, use the effects to add to the sound & you're sure to have a better set!                
This pedal is OK.  If your into funky solos, this is not for you.  It is mainly for any songs that require wah the entire way.                  
It has tons of different combinations of sounds that are easy to create.  The worst part is when the battery runs out.                
its very durable and has good quality                
You dont HAVE to have it compared to some other wah pedals, but it is a fun box if your just messin' around.                
Overall this pedal is decent.  Not exactly Eric Clapton pedal, but its pretty fun to play with                
I purchased the Boss L2 Carry Bag for my new Boss GT-100. The unit fits snug as if designed for it specifically. Plenty of room, with the second storage compartment outside for cords or your extra "Gotta Have" stompbox, or both. Looks great. Seems well put together, but the one negative point.....the zippers seem OK, but time will tell. As far as Manufacturer support, I've dealt with Boss in the past, so I feel safe with their company.                
I bought this bag for my Helix LT and it fits perfectly what a great product at this price can't recommend it enough                
Great product! Bought for my Boss GT-8 and it fits well and my pedal is well-protected!                 
Designed for 3 Boss pedals, this definitely works well for my 2 pedals and AC adapter. I think it'd be pretty tight if you had 3 pedals. Keeping the pedals rigid makes transport and cable management much simpler, so it's a good match for me.                
The way the cover attaches and detaches is a little counter-intuitive, but I think that's a necessity of the design so that the pedals are positioned properly for use.                
It seems fine so far.                
It's probably a little expensive for the capacity, but there's virtually nothing else small out there. I hesitated a long time before purchasing it, but I'm glad I finally di.                
It definitely makes my life easier getting my gear ready to transport. (I'm not a professional musician, but go to a lot of jam sessions).                
Replace with same.                
sound depends on the pedals you use and settings. so its up to you                
has everything you need to get your pedals going. they pop in and out easy to allow disconnecting when you transport your equipment.                 
very easy to use top just pops off to let you get it out the way..                 
The quality is really good.                
a great value for the money!                
never needed any support                
If you have mostly Boss petals this is the case for you..                 
Got two of these and expect them to last for years.                
the unit does not add any noise interference that I can see...and I have 3 of them, chained together.                
This unit is great if you have a lot of Boss pedals; you may have trouble squeezing in pedals from different manufacturers.  That being said, the foam panels are easily removable to fit larger pedals, and a blank piece of foam is included in the kit, to custom cut for an odd shaped pedal.  I have a full sized EHX Metal Muff in one of my boards, and it fit just fine by removing the foam panel.  I have also added a Danelectro mini pedal to a full(6 Boss pedals)board, and it fit perfectly above and between 2 pedals...the board has a daisy chain with 8 connectors, so having more than 6 in the board wasn't a problem.  I don't tour, and my rig stays set up in my living room, so I can't comment on durability.  I will say, that contrary to what someone else mentioned, I don't have a problem "stomping" the pedals....  and I'm not a gymnast........                
as stated before, no extraneous noise.  One thing worth mentioning; though the unit comes with all the connector cables you need, DON'T LOSE THEM!!!!  The Boss cables are sort of propriatary ;  The pedals are spaced too close together to use most generic 6" connector cables!  one of the second hand boards I bought was missing a couple of cables, and after searching for months, I was finally able to find a couple that fit...for $15.00 each!!!!!.  So don't lose the Boss ones, and you won't have any trouble.                
IMHO, it's built like a tank, like other Boss products.  High impact plastic, thick inner foam to protect the pedals.  I bought one of my 3 boards from a touring musician, and it was none the worse for wear after 2 years use.                  
The price seems average to low for pedal boards.  Definately worth the money, and readily available on the used market for around $100.  But buy a new one from Zzounds.....ahem......                
Never had a problem, after owning dozens of Boss products over the years.                
are pedal boards sexy? hmmmmmmmm......                
As I mentioned; I have 3 of these pedal boards, chained together, with one filled with distortion boxes & looped through a noise gate; I have owned them, off and on, for 5 years, and aside from trying to find replacement 6" connector cables, I've had no problems at all.  If lost or stolen, I'd definately replace them with the same.....                
The is great. There is no in-line noise or interference that I've noticed.                
The Pedal board included all the accessories I needed to get started. It fits all manor of Boss pedals and even my Line6 Modules as well.                
The unit is very easy to get started on. Simple to hook up. It could stand to be a little larger. I can't fit all the pedals I would like to in it.                
This Pedal board is NOT very road worthy. I am professional musician who gigs two to three times a week. The first problem I had was the locking clasps. EVERYTHING is plastic, so it doesn't hold up to the abuses inflicted upon it from road use.                
If you are not a touring musician, this pedal board will probably work great. As I stated above, the sound quality and ease of use make it a practical unit for use at home or in a studio.                
To be honest, I don't know what the support is like. After the plastic locking clasp broke, I immediately started looking for a bigger & stronger unit.                
This pedal board does look very nice, especially with Boss pedals and Boss tuner in the top right corner. The cover panels along the top store all the wiring neatly.                
I am already searching for another product, only for the reliability issue. Plastic hardware doesn't last long on tour. It does have excellent sound quality, and it looks great, it just doesn't have the durability required for daily abuse.                
OK, the pedal case itself doesn't have any sound!  But I love the convenience of it.  I have 6 pedals and a tuner all set up in there and it is just so convenient to plug in and play.  PS, I have all Boss pedals except for a Korg tuner (which was on sale, too good to pass up) and they work really well.  I've used Boss pedals for almost 30 years and except for the ones that burned up in a fire, they still work really well.                
The power supply and input / output jacks are really convenient.  I can't think of anything else this might need.                
Very intuitive!                
As with all Boss products, it's fabulous.                
Compared to a flight case, this is pretty darn reasonable.                
Well, I really don't know, as I've never had to use customer support.                
I hope to keep this for years and years!                
Picked this up as a "blem" item for a great discount and I'll be darned if I can find a nick or scratch anywhere. Love the pedalboard with built in power that is hidden nicely to make for a clean set-up. I especially  like the unique foam molding that allows me to fit any size pedal, and I mean any from minature to huge, in it without using that horrible velcro tape that comes undone and ruins the value of the pedal for use alone on a floor or for resale. Love this pedalboard.                
It's a pedal board - It only sounds as good as the stuff you put in it .                
good - it's got everything required to make a decent board                
plug in and play                
good -- i like it                
yeah.                
everything works fine.                
it makes my set up time way faster .                
until i need more stuff and get a pedal board that will hold different voltages . it serves it's purpose right now !!                
Now that I have the case all set up, I love have everything in one place with portability. The only thing I would change on it it to make the top cover removable while playing. The case's lid is in the way.                
This is a poorly designed pedal board for the sole reason that the plastic case prevents you from stomping on your pedals effectively. It is too much of a ridge blocking access to the pedals. You almost have to hit the pedals from above with your toes. If you're looking for a pedalboard to effectively use while you're wearing sneakers, this is not the one.                 
This is a good product but the assembly of the cables requiires some patience and finesse. After making 12 cables, which took about an hour and a half, 7 worked and 5 did not. The only moving part is the set screw on each connector so after 2 hours more of loosening and tightening 5 of the 7 started to work. With 2 left i came to the realization that the problem was that the set screw some of the time was clamping down plenty tight but not piercing the outer coating on the cable so in order to make them work i would puncture the outside of the cable lightly so that the set screw would penetrate. All 12 are now working and Im content. If you buy these be patient when you start to put them together. Try each cable before you set your board up.                
These went together much better than other kits I've tried. A couple of them took two attempts, but not bad. It seems like you have to be really careful to cut them straight. Any angle can screw up the connection.                
 I have tried other Boss overdrive/distortion pedals without coming away with the ooh ah factor tied to them...that is until now. All of you Fender Twin reverb amp owners take notice. This pedal will give your Twin the guts you never thought it had or could have without sounding pretentious.
  I have loved my Fender Twin from the day I bought it. But something was always lacking when it came to going crunch time. Granted I know Twins were not built at the time for harsher edgier types of music, But with the power and tone behind this amp I figured something has to sound good and natural without feeling too mismatched.
   For the longest time my Ibanez tube screamers seemed like the only pedals that gave my Twin any personality until now. The Blues Driver goes the extra mile where my Tube screamer only teased. Dont be fooled by the name of the pedal, it really does rock with my Twin volume at 3 and the pedal level at 9:00, tone at 11:00, and gain all the way up!                  
Boss has always had rugged pedals. The name of this one doesnt do it justice.                
The full gain sound is what sold me. I didnt think the lighter gain sounds were easy to dial in as the Tube screamer.                
I have never had a bad experience with a Boss product.                
  I think if the price was at about 59 bucks, I think they would be flying off the shelves. 79 bucks is abit too pricey for an overdrive pedal.                
n/a                
 The sound is what sells this pedal. My Twin thanks Boss. But change the name of the pedal and lower the price a couple bucks.                
   This pedal will now be the major stomp box for my recordings as well as on stage.                
This really boosts the tone for tube amps and has superb distortion.                 
The product didn't include any accessories, but it didn't need it. It has everything you need and nothing you don't.                
Built like a piece of armor.                 
A great price for a very useful and I'm sure it'll last me very long.                
Wouldn't know, but i'm assuming its good.                
Makes you sound great.                
Overall, a great weapon in the arsenal.                
this pedal makes my small 15w amp gain sustain and makes it range greatly in sound                
simple knobs, but thats all you need to get a good tone out of the pedal                
very well built, metal casing makes this effect last a long time.                
very worth while investment in my arsenal. I would be willing to pay about $80 for this product.                
wouldn't know, never had to deal with them, but i'm sure its good.                
reproduces a very smooth and hypnotizing sound for blues playing.                
Very easily controlled and very durable pedal.                
Terrific pedal, sounds great with my Laney or Marshall amp, along with my Gibson Les Paul Axcess Standard. You'll get heavy distortion out of the device but, depending on how you adjust this pedal, it's great for a crunch and, a bit of a bite too. You can use it from medal to blues.                 
well, the bd-2 is a must for blues players like me. it makes your licks stand out clear. however, the blues driver doesn't sound that rich when doing chords.                
one thing, you can go from overdriven to crunch to clean with your guitar volume.                 
i got mine six years ago. not a single problem                
this is my most important stomp box                
The sound is good with this pedal.  Takes a bit of adjusting to get a sound you might like.  I fould that the level pot to be touchy.  It seems to be either all on or basicly all off.                  
It has the usual features found BOSS pedals.                
Made like a tank.  Hard to beleive that one could ever damage it.                
Good value for the price                
Never had to deal with support.  I've heard that the BOSS support sucks                
With the touchy level pot I have I have stopped using it in my setup and have switched to Digi-Tech 'Bad Monkey.'  I will keep this as a backup.  I hope to do the Keeley upgrades.  
I probably would not replace it as I think that the tone of the Digi-Tech is cleaner.                
The true potential of this pedal can only be achieved by fine tuning the settings. It can add a very pleasant warmth to a tube amp sound but tends to get harsh if the setting are set too high. Time spent experimenting with the settings is worthwhile.                
It sounds great.  My first pedal, and it's still in the line up.                
The basic 3 knobs. But it provides tons of versatality.                
Sturdy as hell. It's a Boss.                
Good price as well.                
This is a bad ass pedal for all types of guitar styles. Crank the gain and get a nice distortion.  Turn it down for a resemblence of SRV's sound. Then just tweak the tone knob. Oh!, and battery life is sufficient too. You almost dont need an adapter.  If you are interested in this thing, just buy it.                
A high quality crunchy sound. Gives you that great "AC/DC style" blues rocky sound.                 
Didn't come with necesarry cords to use it.                
It's a Boss, what else do I have to say?                
Worth it!                
Looks great! That nice blue and black combo looks good.                 
I will be satisfied with the pedal untill it breaks. Which will most likely be a very long time from now.                
Ive bought a ton of "boutique" pedals at all price points. And this pedal by far sounds better and is more versatile than any Ive had . From a slight overdrive to a high gain distortion without getting fuzzy                  
Has way more capability than I have time to fiddle with. I use it mostly on very low depth and rate settings to give a chorus type fill in sound.                
Lots of control available. Standard BOSS casing so it matches up great with the MT-2 in my pedal string.                
Takes some fiddling to get things set just right. What do you expect from a stompbox with this much crammed in though?                
It's BOSS. What more do you need?                
I rated it at a "5" simply because I bought it when I lived in Australia and I feel I paid too much for it.                
N/A                
Very sexy purple color with a two tone LED in it that flashes?? That's frikkin HOT!                
It sounds good together with my other Boss effects units. The sound is more effective for me, especially if it is goes through the Drive Channel in my Marshall amp. it work also good in clean channel but its more effective in drive channel as what I've observe, Its kind of more detailed modulated sound. I have also a Boss Phaser and Tremolo pedal which works also great in same way. I love Boss modulation effects it creates more creativity and music style in my guitar playing.  
Variety of cool modes including new features which make your music style sick!                 
In Boss Quality.. There's only two words: WE TRUST! It will trully last like most other Boss pedals.                 
Compare to other brands Boss usually are way up on their prices. We should remember that most of the times Price and Quality goes together. As long it will last thats the most important thing. For me this pedal is really worth it, if it is priced a hundred even.                  
Never tried so far..                
For the music style I play I difinitely need this effect.                
Its only Boss and Digitech are my main brand in effects units, never tried other brands so far. The Boss BF-3 is one of its kind more usefull modes, make great flanging sound I'm highly satisfied with it.                   
Great sound if ur looking for crazy flanger. Lots of control over the sound. It sounds a bit better than the digitech hyper flanger in my opinon. Like most boss stompboxes the sound is a bit sterile but awesome.                
Its got good features.                
Its boss so its built like a rock. I've had a Mt-2 Metal Zone for 4 yrs and its been like a brick.                 
The price is a bit much but its worth it. I got mine for $180 (CAN). It was a bit more than the digitech 1 but in the long run it was better.                
I had to get my Metal Zone repaired once and its was fastish (took a week or so) and well done. Never actually had to deal with boss.                 
I bough it.                
I can safely say that this pedal will bring me years of joy. Its Great!                
I like it gives you lots of recording options and features. very solidly built too if you.are a guitarist like me you will love it it has a lot of guitar friendly features. Very portable unit can go anywhere I say it's a good buy and boss equipment is quality so if you want a "guitarist" friendly device this is the one. Has a lot of features so there is a learning curve but with how to video instruction and detailed instruction book it's not to bad to figure out. Well worth the price and well you know zZounds is best I order music equipment from no one else.....unit came well packed and few days. Go ahead get one if you want as close to a real studio quality as possible recorder.                
My set up is my travel guitar a mini elec guitar with short neck , br 80, and auxiliary input for the car speaker, When my wife goes shopping with my little grand kids, I can't go with them because of my bad knee, I stay inside the car set up my guitar to my Boss Micro Br 80, connect the line out to the built in auxiliary line input of my car and I thank Toyota Camry Le for having an auxiliary input besides the USB port and Bluetooth there she goes the sounds out to the car speakers, and I have a monitor speaker beautiful sounds immersing inside the car wow outstanding, thank you Boss                
this is a incredible unit jam packed with features im a singer in a rock band and this is such a handy thing to have. i use it to record practices, recording, any live show, writing & recording new songs. the built in mics are very good condenser mics very powerful just set it in the room close to the live sound and you get a quality recording. and its so easy to use you will be doing cool stuff with it in minutes. I'm very pleased                
It might be a nice recorder, but I could not figure out how to use the thing. I read the book and watched some U-Tube instruction videos, but it just did not work for me. I sent it back. zZounds was great about the return. I will buy from them again.                
I ordered the SG on Monday, around noon by phone , FedEx delivered it to my home THE NEXT DAY!!  after setup the guitar is absolutely beautiful.  Monthly payments made it possible for me to own this great guitar! I purchased a boss portable recorder prior the the SG, and I'm equally happy with that. I LOVE Zzounds!!                
My last experience with a multi-track recorder was a four track tape recorder from many years ago. The sound was awful and it had a lot of limitations. The BR-800 sounds simply amazing.                 
The BR-800 comes with a power adapter, a USB cable and a DVD with software including Sonar, a WAV converter and a rhythm editor. I play the guitar and with the BR-800 I feel like I can express my potential. It's almost like having a band in a box. I really like the wheel to select the various options although it takes a bit to get used to it and I definitely like the touch sensors (no clicking noises).                
I was impressed with how easy it was to start recording. The first few days I just toyed with it and managed to record a song using all the tracks with barely a glance to the manual. Then I started studying the manual as well and found it well written although lacking on certain issues (like mixing and mastering).                 
The BR-800 seems definitely well put together but I am not sure how well it would handle the "on the road" treatment. For one thing, it's extremely light (which is obviously a plus as far as portability is concerned) but be careful not to trip in any of the cables or the whole recorder is going to fly off the desk. In my case, I don't really plan to use this much out of the house so no big deal. The other thing is that the top part of the case has a really nice finish to it but shows all the fingerprints and really attracts quite a bit of dust (and with touch sensors there will be plenty of fingerprints).                 
I did quite a bit of research before purchasing the BR-800. I considered older used Boss products and new similar ones (Zoom, etc.). For my kind of situation this seemed like the best value. Now, after 40 some days, I can say that I am totally satisfied with sound and quality.                 
I just called support for a question about a problem with the SD card. The response of the very laid back person (way too laid back in my opinion) was pretty much "dude, the SD card is your problem because it's media so go buy another one". Not really what you would expect from a company after you spend several hundred dollars on their product. Hopefully, they are better when it comes to actual technical support.                 
As I said before, it's a band in a box. I wish stuff like this was around 20 years ago.                 
I will keep this around for as long as it lasts. I am really having a blast!                
This recorder is great.It is easy to use and records quite well.I use it to record live practices and it sounds great.                
Easy record function is great. With the push of a button you can start recording. Just follow the instrustions and you are on your way!                
If you read the manual, setting it up for use through your computer is a snap. It comes with Cakewalk Sonar and getting the two to funtion together is also a snap.                
It seems to be made rather well. All sliders and buttons work great. It is however very light weight. Seems as though it would break rather easily. But since it hasn't, I am quite surprised.                
Well woth the money. It has tons of guitar bass and vocal affects as well as being a top notch recorder.                
 I have not dealt with support because I hsve hsd no reason too.....yet!                
Its just a cool gadget!                
I expect to use it a long time. Thats why I bought it. And yes if it were stolen I would replace it. Couldn't imagine having to write songs without it.                
I purchased a BR 800 a few days ago. ZZOUNDS did a great job on processing and shipping. The BR 800 is amazing. It is user friendly and has an immense amount of features. I now have a home studio that is so easy to use on the go as well. I believe I will enjoy it for years to come.                
THIS BOSS BR800 IS "BOSS" ! Works very well. I am a retired history teacher just getting into music. I use the BR-800 making reciordings of my performances on an electronic keyboard. EASY to Use, outstanding results. I Am very happuy with it. GREAT PRICE and zZounds shipped it to me VERY QUICKLY!                
I bought this item for my husband and he is amazed how a little product could have the sound that it does. The Boss BR-800 has exceeded his expectations. He teaches children guitar lessons and they play in churches and the Boss BR-800 has all the capabilities to record their music and then they can take the Boss BR-800 with them when they perform and it allows them to have music plus what each one of the children play. The Boss BR-800 is great and I am so proud that I was able to purchase the product thru ZZ Sounds payment plan. Thank You!                
The Boss BR-800 came with a 2GB card which holds alot of music and makes it so easy to record what you need. It also comes with a USB cord which is made to only fit the Boss BR-800 which is great. With the USB cord it allows you to download all of the recorded music and put it on your computer.                 
The Boss BR-800 is amazing with the way that it sounds when you playback what you have recorded. The sounds is so clear and sounds just like you were in a big recording studio. The manual was easy to read and it walked you thru each step to take in recording the music. The Boss BR-800 is just easy to use as long as you read your manual before trying to operate the product.                
Boss has always made a great product and when I purchased this for my husband I knew that I was getting a great product. The Boss BR-800 has meet our expectations (really went beyond our expectations) and my husband has been able to record the music that he needs when he and the children he teaches goes out to perform in churches. This is a great product and Thank You ZZ Sounds for allowing me to use the payment plan.                
The Boss BR-800 is worth every penny. My husband did alot of research on the products that he needed and The Boss was the one that did everything that he needed for his music.                
This Boss BR-800 is compact, but yet it has the power and prestige of any higher priced product on the market. If any is looking for a product that will give you great performance, amazing sound, and will do just about everything that you need to make a professional sounding CD or any type of music that you want to use anywhere. It's great!!!                
The Boss BR-800 is all that my husband needs. If he needed another product it would be a Boss. The Boss BR-800 is compact in size, but it is very powerful. It will meet anyone expectations, so check it out and enjoy!                
This unit sounds great right out of the box . many choices of effects amps etc...  cosm sounds great. as do the drums but wish i could do more with them. i mostly play metal and the hi gain amp sounds official.combine that with a drum arrangement that you add the intro  fills and ending to(but is pretty limited) add a bass line using your guitar if you dont have a bass guitar around and you can be a one man army. playing, recording, editing , mixing and mastering then use your computer to convert to wav. file and burn cd                
as im sure youve read the item description this unit has lots of features.i must say i love the touch buttons . bigger brighter screen is a plus . easy enough menu interface  drum selection and editing kinda limited which is why i gave it a 9 but is good enough and sound great plus comes with cool software thats also a plus                
although it is easy enough to use normally ,e z rec , or song sketch , you may need to keep manual close by for other stuff. but thats not a bad thing .it does alot! i was a newbie to the recording process and now im making awesome music that sounds like it was recorded in a studio with expensive equipment                
i think boss makes quality stuff and this is br 800 is no different                
i believe you get what you pay for and this purchase was well worth it in my opinion                
i have had no issues yet ,but i know roland/boss.us have great  customer support                 
pretty slick looking                
overall an awesome unit i would recommend to anyone looking for a multi-track unit                
Love my boss br800 multitrack digital recorder!!! Very user friendly!!!                 
It Depends on your instruments and chords but the sound qualities good.  I know it would sound so much clearer if Boss would just let the recorder record in WAV format instead of the HIFI MT thing. You can only use WAV format in sketch mode which I don't like.  
If BOSS made an updated firmware that would let you choose between HIFI or WAVE format for the main recording section that would be be awesome!                
Everything in effects you need:  guitar effects (GT-10). Bass simulator, Vocal effects (ve-20), acoustic simulator
Recording 4 at one time is better than just 2, but 8 is great                
Very easy to use with EZ recording mode. Gread manual too                
Beautiful but sometimes i feel like I have to be as gentle as if im holding a baby its so light                
To me it should be like 349.99(because only 4 channels recording)or 399.99 like the zoom.                
Boss is great with Support on their website                
I really like the touch sensitive buttons and large screen                
I thinks its great for recording demos, and for if you don't have any effect processors or other people to record with. As for recording live music of a full band and singers its not that good. Boss needs to change the Boss(Hifi) format to uncompressed Wav recording like the Zoom to get the best  clear sound. 
Maybe if Boss would make a downloadable "update" that allows you to use the "sketch book" wave format for regular recording with ALL 4 CHANNELS instead of 2 it would be better. But this is a Good recorder                
Great sound, from really watery effects to crazy fast modulation.    Perfect for what I do.  I use it with keyboards and theremin, too.  Makes for some great noises when coupled with heavy delay and some distortion.  My only complaint is that it makes a low hum with the low filter turned even half way up.                
It would be nice if it came with an adapter because it does drain batteries FAST.  Otherwise features are good.                
The high filter knob has bent a little bit, but it doesn't really effect performance.  I've had it for 10 years now and it hasn't fallen apart.  Boss makes tough pedals.                
Don't remember what I paid, but I've never regretted buying it.  I can't live without a chorus pedal.                
Don't know, never talked to them.  Maybe I should about that hum.                
I like the look of Boss pedals, but that's not the most important factor here now is it?                
Like I said, my only complaint is that hum with the low filter dial turned up.  Maybe there's a way to remedy that?
If I had to replace it, I would probably look at other models.  Before I bought it I also tried the Boss Super Chorus, but the Chorus Ensemble definitely had the better sound.                
I have been using Boss pedals since long time but i did not tried their chorus as i already had a Ibanez one. So when i plugged it in my amp it just sounded superb. It even produce brillant sound in mono setting. It has got everything which a guitarist wants. Sound is clean, rich and amazingly beautiful. It is something i have been missing since so many years. I am completely satisfied with it. It gives good sound if it is being used with distortion.                  
The best feature it has got is the low and high filters which gives you complete control over your desired sound. The pedal is very rugged and the variable knobs are very smooth and quiet. The unit is simply one of the best constructed.                
It is very easy to shape any sound from this unit. It also very simple to mix it with other effects and does not cause any trouble. The manual is very clear and it also stated all the famous settings for various sound productions.                
The unit is very strong and very well made. But its paint finishing seems a little dull. I used it on the road and it is completely reliable. Overall its quality is great.                 
I think the price is a little higher. People now a days perfer to buy the complete effect boards so consequently these individual pedals prices should be reduced to let the hobbiest to get them more easily.                
Never had a problem with their units so far.                
It is a perfect addition to my effect pedal libary. After buying it i can't think to play my guitar without it.                
No i would not change it. I will buy same another one if it being stolen. It surely complements all my musical targets. The best thing is its sound quality and least is its paint finishing quality it is rather dull.                
excellent sound, really brightens up your clean tone, i dont ever use it when playing with distortion but im sure it can keep up with it. I can really hear the difference between playing with a chorus pedal and going completely dry signal clean. I couldnt imagine playing anything clean without chorus just because this pedal adds so much more beautiful tonalites to your tone.                 
5 control knobs, perfect for honing in the sound your looking for, anything from wickedly liquid chorus to something very small and faint sounding                 
Its a boss, so obviously just plug and play. They give you a few examples in the instruction guide which are great but more so better for you seeing how exactly the pedal works and what does what, then from that being able to find your own sound                
ive owned a boss pedal for almost 6 years now and it hasnt broken so i entrust this one to stay put for just as long                 
its nice and cheap, though i traded in my old wah for this so i didnt pay a cent, but its still only like 119 bucks canadian                
Havent had to deal with them, boss products are top of the line they'll never break                
its baby blue, looks like any other boss pedal so it fits in nicely on the ol pedalboard with the rest of em. Made of metal so its gonna be able to take a stompin.                 
As far as im concerned i wont ever need another chorus pedal, if it breaks i'll buy another one just like it. It suits all my needs ive never been limited by what it can or possibly cannot do, absolutely perfect for chorus. Go out an buy it if your lookin for chorus, its lush.                 
This Pedal is a good replacement for the infamous CE2 Chorus.
It responds well and has a very wide range of controlls to get about any chorus sound you would ever need.                
Typical Boss pedal easy to access the battery compartment.                
Very durable. Used Boss when was on the road touring. Very road worthy.                
Yes great price                
Never had to contact them.                
excellent                
Ill use Boss products indefinantly                
very flexible tone and sound. i love it                
great sound and controls, wish it came with an ac adapter cause it just uses up batteries so fast. adapters cost 20 bucks                
sturdy metal, this thing wont break unless you are trying to break it and if it does, there is a 5 yar warranty                
worth every penny you paid. does what it should                
i havent had any problems, but im sure they would give me my five year warranty                
this field really doesnt apply mich to pedals but umm i guess it looks cool                
i dont plan on replacing it. it is a prfessional level pedal that sounds great and is made well.                
it's sound is perfect for anyone looking for a chorus pedal. the 5 knobs give you the control for the sound you want.i voe the sound on it.                
like i said i love the sound on it it'll just be like it's suposed to and it just awsome. the babey blue color is pretty cool too.                
this is a Boss so DUH it's gonna be really easy to you just plug it in and play your heart out.                
like i said its a Boss it's never broken yet and iv'e been useing it for 6 years!                
it's a great deal for someone looking for there first chorus. i know it is.                
Never had to fix a thing.                
its babey blue is a cool touch and it feels great when you play it,even if your on the go.                
I LOVE THIS PEDAL! its sutch an awsome pedal great deal and great for someone looking for there first chorus pedal.                
sounds like its supposed to and you can get just about every chorus sound you want                
the 5 knobs give you the settings you want your chorus to sound like.plus it was a little smaller than expexted but still awsome                
Really easy to use.                
i never expect this product to break and i got it 2 days ago.                
perfect price for a perfect pedal                
never had to call for support                
i think this is a realy good pedal for beggeners and pros!                
i love this pedal its just awsome                
Sound just what I wanted. Smooth, warm and clean. I really love it especially in clean tunes sounds like it float in the sky while you do the plucking or strumming.                
It has five knobs all the of them are usefull really makes a difference. If you turn the "RATE" knob all way up it also creates some sort of vibrato effect.                  
BOSS pedals are gonna last long thats why I like them.                
Dont hesitate to buy this one really worth it.                
Overall Im empressed with this pedal and Im damn glad proud I choose Boss CE-5. Sound + quality + value = BOSS CE-5                
I think this is a great chorus pedal, given I am not a huge huge chorus person, but works great for what i want it for. I am also not using this stereo.                
I havent had any problems dialing in the exact sound i want out of this pedal. 4 knobs are perfect for getting the right chorus sound                
Really easy. Just plug in and play, dialing in what you want is easy also.                
Boss builds there stuff like tanks. Solid metal construction, you could toss this thing off your roof and i would bet it will still work like it's out of the box.                
If your a huge chorus pedal person, im sure there is a nicer sounding one out there, and ive heard the older boss pedals give off more of a vintage sound, but for me this pedal is just fine.                
Never had problems with this pedal, but ive dealt with boss/roland for other things and they have a good support team. They where fast and helped me out accuratly.                
I like the look of boss pedals. Very uniform and look great.                
Im very satisfied with this pedal. I like to use it to just give my guitar a little bit of character while playing on cleam.                
I absolutely LOVE the sound I get from my CH-1! I have an older Black label model that I got at least 15-16 years ago and I have never had ANY problems with mine! I don't really use it for chorus though, I set it's volume level all the way up, EQ at about "3" O'clock, Rate at "9" O'clock and Depth all the way up and I get a really sweet, warm fat sound that I didn't have without this pedal! I use mine with a BOSS FV-50H two-channel volume pedal and simply send the CH-1's output-A to input-1 on the volume pedal and the CH-1's output-B to the volume pedals input-2, than each output on the volume pedal goes to each Marshall head.                
Owned it. Sold it. SOund is 'crisp' but that = harsh to my ears ..                
Features matter not if sound is poor - go for an old CE-2 or even a CE-3 if you want stereo outputs ..                
Boss is always reliable - I have many boss pedals.  Thisi s perhaps the only one I never liked ..                
Not good value if sound no good                
Don't know - never needed them                
no thanks                
didn't like it at all - CE-2, CE-3, small clone are all much better ...                
the sound using this pedal with bass is absolutely amazing if u want a little edge on ur playing, it will blow you out of the water the first time you use it.                
I used my friends when I played with it,but im gettin my credit card out right now to buy one for myself.                
It has no sound of its own, it just brings out your guitar's tone in a simple, effective manner.                
The Sustainer aspect of this pedal performs amazingly well for the price range. At higher settings, though, you may need a noise gate at the end of your effects chain.                
It's a Boss Pedal. Great quality ... easy as pie.                
Absolutely made well. I've had mine for many years and it still holds out like a tank.                
It's very much worth its price. You could spend tons more on a boutique item, but you'll hear very little difference.                
Never had to use Manufacturer Support.                
At the front of my effects chain, this thing tames the peaks while delivering smooth, amazing tone.                
Let's face facts - your sound is incomplete without compression somewhere in the mix. You could spend anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a several thousand dollars on rack gear and great effects, but if there's no compression in there it's like a new tire with a pin-hole leak in it. Your sound isn't airtight.This Boss pedal gives you that element in a simple, affordable package and brings it all together like the salt in your stew. And it does so amazingly well. I have two other rack compressors, but this pedal gives me a much greater mobility and versatility without compromising my sound.It really shines when you run it into your amp clean, with no other effects engaged. Just your naked guitar, neither too loud nor too soft.Beautiful!                
I'm a novice guitar player. After watching YouTube reviews on the Boss CS-3, I decided to give one a try. It certainly wasn't love at first sight. The sound coming from my tube amp after I plugged the CS-3 in for the first time was a BIG change that took a while to get used to. The highs and lows coming from my amp were noticeably compressed, but my wildly erratic picking dynamics suddenly became more controlled as well. YouTube reviews suggest that this compressor is rather heavy-handed, but that's exactly what I needed at this juncture.Give one a try. I think you'll see why a compressor appears on the pedal boards of many, if not most, current professional guitarists. My 4.5-star rating is based solely on the fact that I've never used another compressor, so I have nothing to compare it to. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my CS-3.                
This is exactly what I was looking for.It performs well and adds the sonic flavor that I was looking for.Much better htan my Dunlop                
Sustainnnnnnnnnnnnnn                
twist a knob and get immediate response                
built like a tank                
The price is spot on                
I.ve never had o deal with Boss/Roland directly.They have a lot of info on their site                
It's the first pedal in my line up and the first one I step on                
It does what it does very well.No need to replace it                
it gives a great feel when your playing. I play rock/metal and I heard Synyster used it, so i tried it at guitar center, and it's just what I've been looking for                
i just tried it out.                
it's perfect, and anyone who wants a shreddin' hard rock sound should get one.                
get a Marshall amp to go with it.                
it's under priced, it's too awesome to bee $90.00                
I have other BOSS products, but this is my favorite.                
It would be better in black, dark blue, or red.                
I'm gonna use it, marry it, do it, and honestly die with it. [HAHA]                
This has to be the worst compression/sustain pedal on the market. Was not impressed with this piece of Taiwan junk. It is more of a volume pedal if anything. I dumped it soon after I bought it and sprung for the Janglebox Compression/Sustain pedal. Which by the way is built in the USA. You only get what you pay for.                 
Sounds awesome when you get the pefect sound you want.                
You can get lots of sounds from smooth dynamics to a killer boost.                
Built Like A Tank                
This peddal is overall great for what I use It for. If I had to By it again, I would.                
Like the other reviews say, this only takes a few minutes to figure out, I didn't need to read the instructions. I plan on using this to try to learn to play in odd meter, as well as get my basic timing working well. For odd meter, you set the "beat" setting for "3-4" to count in 7/8 (or 7/4) time, with accents on the 1 and 4 beats, that sort of thing. Or you can set it to "4-3" if that suits you. The "rhythm" setting does quarter notes, 8th notes (two tied together - I'm still learning music, not sure what those are called), 8th rest and 8th note, triplets (I think that's what you call that), and others. If I knew the correct terminology, I could tell you what they are - hopefully you're better with music theory than I am! It also has two clave rhythms, no idea what those are yet (but I plan on looking it up after I do this review). The battery is a 3 volt CR2032, like the ones used in most motherboards in computers, and it comes with one installed, so it's ready to use right out of the box. There's also a 1/8" headphone jack, so I can plug it into my bass practice amp (haven't tried that yet). This is my first metronome, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I think it's all I'll ever need. I got this based on the reviews, and that was a good move!                
This thing is small, compact and has more features than you would think.                
The tone is pleasant enough, but easily cuts through a piano sound.                
Just right for most music students.  If there were many more features, it would be more complicated.                
Five minutes with the instruction sheet, and you'll be able to dial up any rhythm you'll need.                
Seems to be well put together, and is easy on batteries.                
It's a good value for any music student.                
I'll use this as long as it lasts.                
Pleasant to listen to for long periods of time.                 
You can adjust where the accents go, as well as the subdivision of each beat. It has tap tempo and even a tuner which will play all 12 pitches; you can adjust the reference tone (440 is the default, of course). There's a volume control which comes in handy, as well as a headphone jack.                
Spend 5 minutes with it, and you'll figure it out. Pretty straightforward. More features than a typical metronome, maybe, but not hard to figure out how to do everything you want.                
I like the digital metronome arm and overall aesthetics, as well as the compact size.                
I'd say this metronome is where it's at for most people. It does more than just click at a given BPM, having accents and subdivisions such as eighths, sixteenths, triplets, clave patterns, and more. You could go with one of the more elaborate DB models if you are looking for actual beats instead of just a click (I'm not familiar with these models). But for most people, I would venture that you will be satisfied with the features on the DB-30.                
Exactly what you would expect from a Digital Delay Pedal.                 
The medium and long delay times are marvelous for my purposes. It's easy to find the balance you need between the effect level, the feedback, and the delay time. I have yet to figure out the hold feature, but that is a minor gripe.                
An incredibly wide range of sounds can be made with this pedal. Once you experiment a little with each knob, you can easily find the one you're looking for.                
This is a Boss pedal. Need I say more?                
If money is tight, this may not be the one for you. There are other delay pedals that run cheaper. But this product delivers on every penny you pay for on both sound and build quality.                 
I have no experiences with support (I haven't needed it).                
This pedal looks and feels like every other boss pedal I've used, but it's a formula that works. The physical design isn't breaking any boundaries, but it's what's inside that counts.                
I was looking for a digital delay pedal that could create ambient, sound-wave like effects heard in music like 'This Will Destroy You' and 'Mogwai'. I trust Boss quality, listened to some demos on YouTube, and decided on this. I'm incredibly happy with my purchase. If you listen to post-rock and are looking for a similar sound, you cannot go wrong with the DD-3.                
There are some great settings on the DD-3, and once you find them, you will find yourself hitting them nearly every time you solo or go into a punchy rhythm section.  Still, the DD-3 is digital, although a warm digital, and cannot replace a good analog delay.  There is a place for both in many rigs, but the DD-3 is a great digital delay no doubt.                
Lacks a tap tempo, and I find the hold function useless; but, then again it has all the essential settings.                
Easy to dial in a great delay sound in every time frame.  Don't be afraid to turn up the level knob, as it is a bit low from 0 to 50%.                
It's Boss quality, and Boss pedals have always been dependable for me.                
Here is where all pedals lose in my opinion.  All pedals are over priced for what they are.  But the DD-3 specifically is fair, if a bit overpriced.                
Never had to call for support.                
More of the pros I look up to have this pedal than do not have it.                
The DD-3 has the right qualities where it counts, even if it is a bit low on features and price, it is still staying on my pedalboard, which is tough as I only use 3 pedals.                
sounds good and is noisefree.                
for a pedal has a lot of features.                
well made. no back up for me. roadworthy.                
n/a only visited their website.                
attractive looks                
works great                
I haven't had enough expierence with different delay pedals to compare this with others.
I did have a modeling amp with built in delay and I can say for sure this one sounds 100-times better.
I have this set up in my amps effect loops and it wrks perfectly.                
Has all the delay fetures I could possibly need for rythum and solo work.
Built like a tank.                
It takes a little while to learn all you can do with this pedal. But that is half the fun.                
I am impressed with how well made Boss pedals are. I have tried a few other here and there and nothing seems to compare.                
For the price I don't think you can get a more well made nice sounding delay pedal.                
n/a                
Boss pedals always look great too!                
This pedal will last me forever. If it were stolen I would go out and get another one right away.
For me this pedal has all the featuers I will ever need and none that will go unused.                
Not exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for an echo sound at the end of the last note or chord. The pedal does great delay. Maybe, I need to look more into the directions or a different type of pedal.                
I use it on all my solos, i cant play my solos without this, very very clean delay                
Just a simple delay                
fantastic quality, the delay sounds terrific                
The best amount of money i paid for an effect                
the thing that appeals me to this pedal is quality and reliability, else i dun have any other BOSS pedals in my setup                
I would be keeping this for good                
Did some research and chose this guy for use with my Bass guitar. I needed something versatile, reliable, and easy to manage. We play with in-ear monitors and a click track so every song has specific timing for things. I wanted a delay I could dial in the timing to a specific BPM and choose which note is getting the delay beat. And here I introduce the DD-500 - Boom Son! Sounds great with Bass guitar, countless options and capabilities, quick learning curve, ability to save tons of settings and pull them up quickly while on stage. Everything from super tight punchy delay sounds, to that washed out muddy swirling sound you can use for intro and outro bits.
Stunning. Why buy something else when you could have the  Millennium Falcon.

zZounds is amazing! great customer service, thank you for the ease of payment option if needed, and for timely deliveries!!                  
The sound is decent overall, some modes sound better than others.
My last two delays were a Flashback and before that an EchoPark and this pedal sounds better than either and, offers TONS more functionality. 
I don't care for the sound of the Shimmer mode, this is one of the few areas where I feel that the DD-500 really falls short of its closest competitors. 
I could do without the Terra Echo too. 
Instead of an effects loop for the repeats, it has built in effects that you can add to the repeats within the unit. Aside from the modulations, I don't care for most of the effects and would have much rather had an effects loop.
Don't get me wrong though, I am VERY pleased with this pedal.
I mainly use the Standard and Analog modes and they sound just fine and are worth the price of admission alone.                
This is where this pedal really impresses.
This things has ten times more functionality than I will ever use.
The real genius of this design is that you can either walk right up to it and twist knobs and get a good basic sound quick and easy or you can go into the deep editing and let your imagination run wild.
Seriously, this thing is only limited by how much time you want to spend tinkering with it.
The manual manages to be BOTH huge and worthless, a common theme among Roland's more complicated products and, believe me, this pedal CAN get complicated if that's what you want.
The ONLY feature I would like to see that was omitted would be an effects loop.                   
This pedal can be adjusted pretty easily but, if ease of use is a serious concern of yours, I would probably just look at something else entirely.                
My last two digital delays both went out within 2-3 years and, THAT was my main motivator in choosing a Boss product. Many people I have owned and played lots of Boss and Roland products over the decades and they have consistently been some of the most reliable music products I have ever seen.
I have only owned this pedal a few months so, I can't really speak to it's reliability at this point but, I am optimistic about it.                
This is obviously subjective.
The truth is, I would have probably been just fine with the DD-7 at half the price....
BUT!
zZounds make it so darned easy to treat yourself with their awesome payment plans,...so why not?!!?
In comparison to pedals like the Timeline, Time Factor, Flashback X4, etc... I think the DD-500 offers the most options for the money. The reputation of Boss and Roland products also makes me more confident to spend this kind of money on a pedal.
I think it is money well spent.                
Never needed to contact Roland before. The manuals are terrible though.                
I think that this pedal is terribly ugly. They should have hit is with that snazzy black metal flake paint job that's on the the Boss RV-6.                
A top shelf multi-delay that is a bit more affordable than it's competition.                 
Well, I've had this for right at a week now. I cannot even begin to explain just how versatile this delay is. If you're on a budget, it could even do chorus and reverb in a pinch (not the best chorus or reverb, but decent), but what this thing excells at is out of this world unique delay sounds. It can do all your standard delays, and it can do them very well for a digital reproduction of them. The only one that I'm not completely satisfied with is the tape delay mode. Its decent for sure, but nowhere near as good as a stand alone tape delah repro. The rest of them, well I would challenge anyone to tell the difference between the dd500 and what theyre trying to emulate. A very seasoned pro maybe able to, but your average dude I'm the crowd wouldn't be able to tell the difference for sure. The value here is truly unparalleled. What you're getting is the highest fidelity delay on the market, and a delay that is capable of almost anything you could possibly want and a whole lot that you never even realized you wanted, lol. This unit has a few delays that are even unique to boss that you wouldn't find in another brand. The tera echo, shimmer, and sfx modes are delays that you would spend well over 300 dollars for on their own if you wanted to get the same sound with stomp boxes. The many presets on here are amazing. I could probably just sit there all day switching between them and creating riffs to match each unique mode. You can also create a near endless amount of your own patches as well, with extreme tweakability on nearly every parameter. If you're the type that just wants to plug and play though, Thats not a problem either, with nearly 200 presets that range from classic to insane, you can just jam away without having to bend down and tweak knobs, while using nearly the full range of this unit. I have never been more satisfied with a gear purchase than I am with this. I'm not usually a fan of digital effects or multi effects units at all, because the quality suffers with the versatility. Most of them do a lot of things but none of them well. This thing does a lot of things and all of them well. Very well even. I am sure that I will still be experimenting and finding new sounds for years to come with this. What else can you pay 300 dollars for and get that many hours of joy from?! You get the standard delays we all know and love, and easy accessibility also, to make this a gigging machine. Once you get home to your bedroom or studio, it doubles as the ultimate experimental oddity of a pedal. I would buy this over and over again, though I'm sure it'll last as its built like a tank. So, if you're looking for a versatile delay, or you're unfamiliar with delay and dont know what you like, don't hesitate to buy this pedal. I couldn't see anyone regretting it.                
I do not think anyone could forge an argument that this is not the delay of choice for $300. I find it has the features I need and actually does things others do not. Once you get in there and really tweak on the modes and param adjusts you are going to find it can do what you want and maybe more so. 
Things that are important to me are bandwidth fidelity, processing quality, multiple modes of delays, a phrase looper, an all important actual ms readout, and presets.
Nothing really has more than this unit, an A/B of 99 banks is certainly more than you can use. You can get into this and get it to do just a flange or chorus sound, so many cool delays just waiting to be tweaked in to ones sonic ideal. I am not really a fan of Boss and this is the 1st Boss pedal I have messed with in ages, but this is new level of design and quality that not only competes with higher priced units but in some ways give them more than a run for the money. 
Sure Nemesis is a great delay but no readout, how do you know where the proper ms or interval of a 5th is if you can't see it, put a tuner after the delay, guess? All the benefits of a Strymon flagship and a few things like Terra, and SPX it does not offer. Well worth the price tag. The Delay of choice for my opinion.                 
I had been wanting one of these pedals for a long time and zZounds enabled me to get it with their Play As You Pay Program. The DD7 is everything I thought it would be. It is easy to use and has great sound. I play mainly 60's & 70's Classic Rock and The Shadows and Ventures. The DD7 helped me to get that fantastic Hank Marvin sound on my Strat that I also purchased from zZounds.com. zZounds is great and is the best online music store there is. They have came through every time for me and I will continue to purchase my gear and guitars from zZounds. The reason I gave Manufacturer Support 1 star is because I haven't had to use it.                
This is a really cool delay pedal! I really like how many features there are such as different delay times, an analog feature, and reverse feature. The tap tempo feature is really handy too for on-the-fly delay timing. The only slight downside is that it takes a while to dial in the perfect delay setting, depending on what you're looking for.                
Thing is perfect, when you diddle with the knobs you really feel like you're changing the sound, the delay, the feedback. Everything modifies the way you want it to be modified. This isn't a pedal you just turn on and off, you gotta mess with it.                 
Features? its built like a box, the effects from delay frequencies, looper built in, and reverse effects with an analog chorus? Screw the visual sound h20 pedal. Get this one, its cheaper and more efficient.                 
foot steps on pedal. Pedal works.                 
Its a boss product.                
i bought mine off ebay for 100 bucks perfect condition.                 
haven't needed support, which means well built product.                 
Looks great, love the color, bright LED, make people "want" you                
i use it whenever i can implement it in my band, and also the looper station entertains me for hours when i need to work on riffs and song writing.                 
Before getting this pedal I already had a dd20 in my setup but now that I have these two together, it is just amazing the things you can do with these both combined! Boss makes some real good pedals made to last and this one does not fall short from that category                
The boss DD-7 is a solid choice for a delay pedal. Does mostly everything you could want a delay to do. Reverse function is a really awesome addition to the DD-7. The ability to add a FS-5U footswitch to the unit is a must for the live musician who needs to tap tempo for delay on the fly. I would recommend this pedal for anyone looking to add a delay to their pedal chain. This is a must have.                 
I bought a DD7 and Flashback Mini at the same time. The DD7, I've known about for years. It sounds great...Boss has some great delays...ALMOST as good as TC. I love the fact that you can use the external tap pedal. Looping option is nice...I use the analog delay setting with the 2290 preset on the Flashback...they work very well together. Plus because it's Boss it's built like a tank                
I've been using Boss pedals for 15 years...  Crystal clear; Boss reliability.  Perfect!                
To be very honest, I regretted selling mine, I went on a venture thinking there are tons of other delay pedal  that are better and there are! but as far as reliability issues and consistency,The Boss DD-7 surpasses allot on this price range and function capability's.
I had two of these on my pedalboard set differently and it was great,no tone loss or I couldn't even tell. That's coming from a very overly picky person concerning tone!  If you got one of these,don't sell it unless its a matter of life or death situation. Now I gotta save up all over and deal with my intermittent, made in china, visual sound dual tap delay.
I have bunch of other boss pedals and not one of them ever crap out on me for as long as I've own Boss pedals over the last 25 yrs of playing live and studio! go figure I'll stick to the Boss from now on....                
I love this pedal. The sound quality is great and the modes really get your imagination going. 
For me it's a must have.                
I usually mess around with de Feedback and Delay Time knobs and I get some very intersting sounds from it!
One thing that is cool also is when I turn off the delay the sound doesn't break and I can continue to play without the delay.
The tap tempo is really easy to use.
But there is something that could be better. When on Hold for recording I can't use the Delay. That's a real shame...                
Very easy to use. 4 knobs.
Level
Feedback
Delay Time
Mode
Simple!                
It's a Boss!
I have dropped the pedal a few times and it's still workin'
A little bit of the paint went of and the Level knob is a little beated up.
It's rock solid!                
It's worth it!                
Never needed (and I guees I never will)                
Everything was great about the Boss DM-2W from build quality to sound, etc...very nice pedal with very cool options of expression pedal control and Wet/Dry Outputs.  I prefer Digital Delays to Analog.  Analog delays have warmer repeats and Iprefer more crisp, brighter repeats.  There is a "grainy" quality to the repeats of the DM--2W that some users may not like, it is there and is apparent.  I've read other users report the same findings.  If you like Analog Delays, give this a try, it is quality, just not for me.                
I use this with a zoom g2 and a bugera 1960 head.  i can get plenty of distortion with this unit.  I crank the distortion to near full back off the tone a little past half way and put level at half way.  I gig a lot and every musician I've talked to has told me they love the sound I get from that set up.  Sustain is unbelievable.                 
basic pedal easy to operate solid metal chassis                
set the three knobs where you want it and let it rip.  This unit will make a bad amp sound great.                
I've be around the block with pedals.  Multi-effects units leave the distortion empty and very digital sounding.  If you are looking for a great distortion don't let this pass you by.                
Here's the best part. I'm a part time musician.  When I do play I don't make thousands more like hundreds.  that being said 40 for a boss pedal that kick this much A$$ is outrageous.  They should lock someone up for that.                
I've never dealt with them before.                
most of the musicians can't believe the sound i'm getting from this thing.  I have people asking me about the pedal and the amp.                
This is great, i'd buy another one without a thought.  Looking at the overdrive pedal as the next pedal.  well done.                
I purchased 2 of these, one to mod,the other to leave stock. The whole process has been a gamechanger for me as a guitarist using pedals. While the stock pedal has a reputation for a "fizzy" distortion, it actually depends on the amp/guitar you are using. Some set-ups this pedal sounds iffy, others it's a WOW situation. The PERFECT pedal at the price it goes for, especially for modding. ORDER ONE FROM ZZOUNDS,they plain rock in the customer service dept., plus you can reach them on weekends!                
i love this distortion pedel is has great sounds for all my songs it realy makes my song sound better than it was.                
i think this product is made great.                
i think the price is great but i think u can make it more price                
the people i bought it from they were helpfull and friendly                
i think ill keep this distortion pedel for 1 year than get a better one when im better.                
there is nothing i would change on this beast of a pedal~!!!                
I use 2 chords and my Cort G-210 Guitar and a rocketech amp thats it no accesaries! , I went on a website and checked to see how to get certain sounds and its a great pedal Its sturdy and takes a beating the orange looks awesome and it has had no problems and i've played at talent show and it has never failed , when you come into a distortion part in a song it flows in  , Kurt Cobain had the exact same one and he played live with it , AmAzIng pedAl for aN AmAziNG PriCe! ! !                 
Never had a problem a little bit of chippin of the paint but who cares its amazing its small not a huge bulky piece of crap that breaks down and u never have to tighten it or get it fixed ! ! ! I've had mine for 3 years , I've never had a problem with it .                
Its an amazing deal i have other pedals worth 200-500 dollars and this  1 is the best workin and my favorite~~~!!! worth the every cent!                
Never had a problem i got mine FREE!!! of a family friend who plays in a band . !!!                
it looks awesome i play rock grunge and it is absoultly amazing , i could still make good music but it just sounds so much better chicks dig it ! ! ! and the person who made it is THe BEST !!! wouldnt change anything!                
It has exceded my expectations and i will buy boss over any other guitar equipment , customer 4 life! , i play my own stuff and mainly nirvana metallica ozzy ac/dc , and it sounds amazing i get ppls askin all the time were i got it and i always have offers after shows for it Is 1 of a kind !!!                
Great classic distortion while letting the natural tone of your guitar shine through. Good harmonic overtones on solo passages. I have 1 stock and 1 Keeley Self-Modded which I really love. Great tone for a great price. Many modding options available for this pedal.                 
Basic controls. True bypass would be nice. There is a mod for that also.                
Very easy to get a good sound.                
Good quality. Sturdy metal case can withstand lots of abuse. 5 year factory warranty if you don't take it a part.                
Affordable...                
N/A                
Practical go to pedal for distortion.                
I got it for the explicit purpose of modifying it.                 
When you have the distortion up to full you better have a noise suppressor, because at max level and distortion it sounds like crap. It is a distortion pedal so don't expect anything special out of it, It provides a nice distortion though.                 
3 Knobs... Tone, Level, and Distortion... Tone changes the tone of it lol... Like at 0 it sounds kinda bluesey and at 12 o clock it sounds good to me. Level would control the actual volume that the guitar has when the pedal is activated (sometimes i find that when i kick the distortion pedal in it gets really loud so this knob helps) And finally distortion wich controls the level of distortion. When this is at 0 it is still a bit distorted... So don't expect to just be able to use it for tone.                
Just turn the knobs until you find a nice sound it's pretty simple...                
Very nice, I don't think i've had any problems with it, easy to get batteries into if you use batteries (i use power supply with a splitter personally)                 
Worth the money.                
Very nice looking, personally I think boss pedals look the best next to Ibanez. It's a VERY nice looking orange. And I bought it with a pedal case that fits 3 boss pedals so I have it between a baby blue Chorus Ensemble and a White tuner pedal. It doesn't look half bad surprisingly...                 
A while, I might mod it in the future, but I think this is going to be with me for a LONG time... Unless I get a good multi-effects pedal, in which case I think I'll keep this for live shows etc as it's small and the box is easy as anything to carry around.                
it does what it is supposed to. its a great little distortion box. [10]                
great loud distortion. [10]                
just three simple knobs really easy of use [10]                
its a boss so ... you get the idea its built like a tank. [10]                
such a great pedal but i never thaught it would bo so cheap! [10]                
never had to deal with them [10]                
the bright orange isnt hard to miss plus i think its the best distortion box [10]                
i dont think this item will break but if it does ill surely by another [10]                
great for all types of sounds. fuzz metal, smooth overdrive. Its all here.                
it should come with adapter                
very easy to use 3 knobs tone, level, distortion, i dint take me long to find my favorting setting, easy to use                
its a tank . It will last 50 years. I dropp it all the time. It will never break                
best vaule out there i like it better than a 70 dollar pedal i have.                
no                
orange is cool                
I bought this for my son. He said this is exactly what he wanted. The tone is great and the pedal is very versatile. I noticed that it is well made and should last him for quite some time. Well worth it's price.                
the sound is great u can make it sound like korn and metallica and even slipknot if u want.                
the features r good so u can play alot of differnt styles of music on it                
the pedal is the best and u can beat it around alot and it will still work.cause i know i have been mad alot and i through it and a big stack of bricks and i threw it down to the cement drivway and i just had to plug it back in and it still worked fine                
yes it is                
never had a problem                
nothing to say bout' it                
u could do alot of stuff and it will work also alot of differnt singers u can play on it                
I play my bass through it and it doesn't cut off the lows at all.                
It just does what its name implies. No more no less. You want some guts? Step on it.                
duh. 3 knobs man. If you can't figure it out go play a clarinet or something.                
All boss pedals are hardcore durable. That's their biggest appeal over other manufacturers. This thing has been dropped, stomped on, and still works just fine.                
One of the best distorters in the world and only 40 bucks? who can say no?                
Boss guys are really down to earth. I had to talk to them about my micro-br before, not about this no-brainer, but they got right back ahold of me asap and answered my questions. No attitude.                
I just use the one my guitarist had when he switched to a big muff. I want one, but I dont need to buy one. As far as sex appeal... there's nothing sexy like a pimp bottom bass line that can get hard with one stomp. Thats what I like it for.                
I'm gonna use it until my guitarist wants it back then I'll just get my own. It works for bass signals, which is very rare for distortion pedals I have worked with, including dedicated bass overdrive by the same company that costs thrice the price.                
the sound quality is awesome!!!!!!!!.......... it does not sound good when it is high on dist & tone..                
some more extra knobs should do the trick......                
there are just 3 knobs so, it`s obvious that it is easy to use!!!                
boss is the best.                
worth ........                
the support from the boss is good                
instead of the orange i think black or any dark color would suit it...                
ds1 is handy!!!!                
don't listen to reviewers who say this pedal is crap. there the type who think it all sounds crap unless its ear splittingly loud and irritating. i've had this pedal over a year and it rocks. used properly it can drive your amp to the brink. i don't need another distortion                
simple controls yes but it isn't an aeroplane your flying is it. there's enough there to get alot of different tone's. the basic control's work with your guitar, not against it. just look at some of the pro's who have relied on this baby.                
walk in the park. ideal for any level of player                
you could switch it on and of with a tank and this beauty would still work fine. its solid and built to last. its a boss after all                
you won't find a pedal of this build and quality at a better price anywhere                
never needed them but i bet there customer support centre isn't busy                
yeah, thats why i've already got it                
i wouldn't trade this pedal for any other. what ever music you play this thing can do it. don't listen to the negative reviewer's, they obviously haven't set there guitars/amps right. this pedal is a rock legend. don't ignore it                
The sound of this product fits my needs perfectly. It has just the right amount of distortion. The sound isn't too muddy or unclear. The tone this pedal is really good. This pedal is good for playing alomst anything. I play a lot of Nirvana with it and it sounds exactly like them. The sound is great. It has a nice rock sound to it. Much heavier than overdrive pedals.                
It has a three knobs. Tone, level, and distortion. Turning up the distortion gives you a fuzz type of sound and turn it down gives you a warm overdrive sound. There is an adapter for it, but I don't have it.                 
It is built tough. I can tell it will last.                 
It was only $40.00! That is a steal for something this good.                
Haven't dealt with the company. 5 year warranty.                
The orange color looks cool.                
It is worth the money you pay for it. I'm glad that I got this pedal. I use all the time. If it was stolen or lost I would get another one. It's good for almost playing anything. I love this thing.                
I have 2 of these, one just bought recently just to replace the old one or maybe will try to MOD it has time, but overall, the DS-1 is a must have for starters. I love Boss pedals and I am beginning to collect them so the DS-1 should definitely be in my collection. The sound is pretty much easy to configure depending on what music you are. But this pedal in my opinion should be used for hard rock type of music. Not for blues of jazz. In my settings, as far as the tone knob is concern, I dont usually go beyond 11 o'clock and the gain will around 3 - 5 o'clock. But overall, it is still a great pedal.                
It sounds like a very straightforeward distortion. Not so much ugly hiss like some other pedals (especially on multi-effects) and I have used a LOT of different stompers. There are others with more specific tone characters to them like the Muff or the Screamer, but this is just what it says it is... very basic. Like distortion 101.                
THIS is why I had to get one of these. I play bass guitar and sing. I play the bass like a guitarist alternaming between 'lead' lines and a lot of power chords. I have a big problem with most dedicated drive effects for the bass as they tend to cut out the bottom end a lot and actually make it sound quieter when I kick it in, either that or the crunch isn't nearly enough for the full sound I need. The style I play is just my voice, my bass, and my drummer so I needed something that would really thicken it out to make up for the fact that it's just a 2 piece but I still wanted a full sound. I was playing at an open mic and I saw the bass player from another band that was rockin out on this thing and I asked him if I could try it out for my set and I couldn't believe how well it worked with a bass signal. NO cutting of the low, just a big ballsy evil heavy blast of noise and really made my higher register power chords fill out. I actually recommend this over dedicated bass guitar effects for drive. I got one a couple weeks later and run it between a cheap p-bass knockoff and a midsizey 90 watt behringer amp and my little minimalist 2 piece rock act suddenly had so much more oomf to it.                 
Its a distortion pedal. step on it. I turn the gain all the way up and the tone around halfway maybe a little brighter, and just fix the level so there is just a slight volume boost when it kicks in. Distortion isn't meant to make it louder, just to sound louder. Like I said, I don't experience any loss of low end when I put my bass into it.                
Boss stomper stuff doesn't break. Never in my experience anyways.                 
I was surprised when I found out it's so cheap.                
I never talked to them about this pedal, never had to, but the guy at the BOSS website was quick to answer a question I had about a recorder I used from them.                 
I used the borrowed one and went and got one of my own a week or two later.                
It's simple, durable, cheap, and does what it says it will do.                
This is a great solid, cheap, first-time pedal. I first heard it on a Peavey Blazer 158, and the sound was perfect! The dist. on it is great. It sounds the best on any peavey amp, but others, I would rate it a 6. Also, it is great for palm-muting.                
Not great, but provides a great range of Dist.                
"Very reliable and hard" is what you think of it after you have stepped on it thousands of times and nothing falls apart. It is also very easy to change backup batteries.                
It is totally worth its price because it is only 50 bucks with the power cable and its great sound                
I dont know about support of Boss because I didnt need any help with the pedal! All i know is that they make the very best of the best in Quality, and great sounding and looking pedals.                 
it does look kind of cool in a way doesnt it?                
I love it and there is nothing acceptionaly bad about it. I thingk it will last with me throughout my guitar career.                
I have a Blackstar HT20 & a Mesa Boogie and my main guitars are a PRS custom 24 and an Epiphone Les Paul plus top with gibson 490 & 498 pick ups.  Both my amps have great lead high gain channels.  This pedal kicks things up a notch and pushes them into 'the zone'. Thats whats the DS-1 is famous  for.  This pedal was made for driving tube amps hard and getting the most out of them.  Theres a reason why the DS-1 has stood the test of time.  Anyone who knocks pedal this doesnt know what they're talking about.                 
This pedal is one of the best pedals I've played up to date. when the tone level is at the bottom it sounds kinda bluesy. when it's at 12'0 clock it sounds realy high gained like grunge or metal when its at the end it sounds more like a overdrive. It's good for a lot of nirvana type music                
3 knobs, a input and out put and a battery compartment pretty simple. though it would of been nice if it had a AC adapter but if you use multiple pedals you should get a 1spot daisy chain sort of thing                
just turn the knobs to your liking pretty simple                
very well made and sturdy with it being made of metal you can really stomp on it                
39 bucks is way worth the money instead of buying one of those 100 digitechs                
Dont know I've only had it for 4 days                
it likes so awsome next to my crybaby and DOD chorus I like the color orange on it                
my greatest pedal I own sounds great and a really good price                
Really good, works well with cheap amps with a bad distortion.                 
no special features, just bare bone                
I've had it for 20yrs and it has never had a problem.                
Other pedals offer more options like Digitech                
Don't need it                
Very strong and durable, but get a Digitech to get the same sound pluss much more.                
Still sounds good, a little oudated.                
The Distortion Pedal. Played for 20 years, rock, funk, punk, and metal. Does it all.                
Three knobs; a Gazillion sounds. Metal box, like Boss does. Orange; easy to see on a dark stage. My first one lasted over 15 years.                
Intuitive is an understatement.                 
My original DS-1 was top notch. The 2nd seems no different. Time will tell, I'm sure.                
Had about 10 distortion/fuzz pedals. DS-1 always ends up in my signal chain. Awesome value.                
Stunning. Serious design genius.                 
Really good sounding lead distortion for any 70's-80's song. Goes from fuzzy to sharp with a twist of the knob. Great for solid rythms too. it's not bad for punk either.                
The features aren't numerous, but why would they be? Everything it has is all it needs                
It's solid as a rock                
For forty bucks, you get alot of pedal. Well worth the money because of its versatility                
Never had to call em                
It's a guitar pedal...                
It's a great Pedal                
the sound is for a more intense tone the white noise is quite noticable while not playing but while playing it makes the guitar scream just the way i like it, by itself its not the greatest sound but before my fuzz pedal i havent heard any other combination other than the ds-2 sound the way it does and thats a good thing! mixed with the right gain or other distotoin pedals it is a great effect for producing feedback                
lol ive beeb stomping on it for 2 years now and its still reacts like new something ive found very reliable from boss                
i love orange                
Great distortion. Makes my vocals send shivers down people's spines.                
It distorts and does that very well. <RANT>Though, as a keyboardist, I wish they had a similar model that was MIDI triggered, but I guess that's why we have effects units, right? Nice thought though!</RANT>                
Seems pretty durable, and the orange casing always gets attention.                 
Very cheap for an easy to use, quick setup distortion box. plug mic in and go. Demonic voices in a box! YAY!                
Haven't used it.                
Many notable industrial/EBM bands have used this unit. Ranging from :Wumpscut: to Skinny Puppy and Din_Fiv. So...there must be something to it. And we all know how good the distorted vocals of :Wumpscut: sound :D                
If you are doing industrial and want a good distortion effect for you vocals...this would be the box to get. Just wish it had MIDI :\                 
This pedal is the bomb and if u are getting it for around $40 get it no matter what.I payed $70 for mine and i don't regret it.I also own a line 6 POD 2.0 which i just got after DS-1 and i have two bands,1 in which i use a boss me-30(which is a dream pedal if u can afford $250).But for the price of the DS-1 and its simplicity there is no better pedal around.I wish there was a more crunchier effect thats it.Best used with a vox Wah.                
It only had 3 knobs for tone,level,and distorion unlike the DS-2 but still amazing.It came with a booklet that tells you some settings such as british punk,cruch,american rock,and ect. effects.I use a Les Paul and Strat with it and works great both ways.                
Very easy to use.Push and u got it.Turn black knob and change battery.Turn all 3 nobs all the way up and then turn tone down a bit or too where u like and u are set.Good Luck if u get it.                
The battery screw comes out alot while i am playing and causes me to have to stop song to screw in but if u screw it tight enough you will be fine and don't stomp like a monster with it.Won't break on ya don't worry.                
Price,Product,Perfect.The 3 p's.                
I dunno.No problems and i know alot of people with same pedal so i ask them.                
It called me over and said take me home with you even though i never really needed it even at the time i had 2 other chours distorion pedals.I went to store to get a new humbuckers and saw it and the ugre that i had for it when i started playing gutiar 2 years ago came back and i bought it.                
I think until i tottaly figure out my POD then this product is perfect.I will definetly not sell it and keep it aslong as i can.Maybe eventually give it to a young apprentice.Really its just a fun pedal to bring to jam seesionsand is really fun to mess around with.                
it is what it is, a good pedal                
its very nice has a nice sound to it but not the greatest so i give it a nine                 
not enough pick ups                
boss makes some of the best guitar accesorries                
some are cheaper and better                 
i wouldnt know i never had a problem with it                
yea distortion is a very sexy thing                
im sure another pedal will come along i like better                
It has a good tone of distortion, but I wish it was a bit less fuzz to it's tone.                
I wish it had some more...                
I like the way it was set up. Easy to understand.                
It was pretty cheap for a guitar pedal, so I didn't expect "Perfect" quality.                
It's pretty good, but there are plenty of better distortion pedals made by Boss out there.                
From light crunch to deep distortion just short of metal, this pedal has a wide range for anyone looking for a bit of a bluesy snap to a sharp solo distortion. the knobs are few, but very functional, to the point where a simple turn of the knob can change the character of your distortion. It's noiseless and works well with other pedals, and not just boss brand pedals. For 35-40 dollars, maybe half of that if you get it used, this pedal is the clearest distortion, rivaling pedals with triple the cost. Very, very worth it.                
Not a whole lot to offer, but if you're looking for your distortion pedal to do more than distort, you should stray away. This pedal serves one purpose and serves it to perfection: Distortion.                
Three knobs means that you have the ability to get a wide range of sounds without hours of messing with it. Also, the booklet offers a few great sounding settings, so be sure to check that out if you're having trouble with the tone.                
Boss pedals are notorious for lasting lifetimes. This is no exception.                
This is one of the best values in effects shopping. Great, versatile distortion under fifty dollars? It's the Behringer price at the Boss quality.                
Default ten because I've not needed it.                
It's construction orange. Not a bad look, and it stands out on your pedal board. Simple design, obviously functional rather than vain. As much as I love my equipment to look great, it's more about the tone, especially when it comes to pedals.                
Great distortion. I played with it in the store on the tower of boss equipment, and it made a lot of guitars sound very good. I would highly recommend it.                
Lets start w/ the goods. It has a wide variety of tones that fit almost every musical style. The EQ, while basic, is actually pretty good, and w/ the EQ and distortion, you can find almost any tone from punk to pop to blues.
But there are a few big negatives. First off, the distortion amount, while decent, isnt enough. Its barely usable for hard rock and metal (although I do use it for the rhythm guitar).                
There are three things here: a suprisingly effective EQ, a distortion knob, and a level knob. It gets the job done.                
Its a pedal. Duh.                
Well... its a Boss Pedal. I believe thats all I need to know.                 
OK. Its $100+ for a distortion pedal w/ weak distortion and a good EQ. I got a DanElectro FAB Metal (and three other pedals) for half that price. The DanElectro has just as good an EQ, better distortion, better looks, wider range of tones. Basically, better everything (except durability - the DanElectro is plastic). Is that a good comarison?                
Ill give it a 10 by default. I havent needed any help thus far.                
As I said earlier, its just a pedal. And to boot, it looks a lot like other pedals.                
OK. Knowing that Boss makes this pedal, it suceeds in the smaller area. But where it matters (sound), it falls way short, even with a shockingly good EQ. Bottom Line: Good for beginners. For experts/metalheads, get something else. A good pedal is the DanElectro FAB Metal.                
It sounds very electronic and doesn't have a lot of body.  Kind of brittle sounding.  When your roll the tone around all it really does is roll off the high end and muddy up your sound.  I run it at about 10 O'clock on TONE, 2 O'clock on DIST with my Strats.                
It has the usual.  No problems there.                
I've had trouble using a power adaptor.                
I guess you get what you pay for.                
I already have a RATT pedal from ProCo and it ROCKS.  I thought I would try this one out.  It's OK for a back up or for just some grungy chording.                
Tons of noise.  more noise than distortion.  When you do hear the distortion through the noise it sounds fakey and thin.                
no usefull features - the noise makes it unusable                
Very easy to use, just plug it in, turn up the level, listen to the white noise and un-plug it                
Its a boss - built like a tank - will never wear out.  Of couse it rearly gets used.                
does't cost much but does't do much                
never needed                
it does look good, but not very useful, everyone seems to have one , why I don't know                
Way over rated.  I don't know why people rave about it except maybe to justify their ownership.  The white noise overpowers the thin distortion produced by the DS-1.  Just overdriving my amp gives better and more sensitve distortion.  Look for something else or save your money for a nice tube amp with stepped gain that you can overdrive                
This is an on off switch for a very awkward sounding distortion. It is probably the cheapest pedal that boss makes and you get what you pay for. It sucks all the tone out of your guitar and the distortion it adds sounds more like killing a squirrel than rock and roll. I am goign to stick with my amp's overdrive feature.                
The distortion level knob gives you little to no actual control over it. the volume works but it is not a true sliding scale, it jumps so that there are about 3 real volume levels. and the tone  knob is also on/off.                
If you know kind of how any pedal works, this'll be a breeze. Everything is on/off.                
Lukily for boss they make their pedals strong enough to withstand those guitarist that actually stomp on their pedals. But once again, without it working correctly that doesn't mean much.                
To be fair, this is a cheap pedal.                
N/A                
Just because it's boss, which makes fantastic pedals, doesn't make the DS-1 a quality pedal. I suggest doing actual research before you buy.                
Look up youtube demos before you buy any pedal!                
Not for everyone, metal heads probably won't enjoy it. However, I personally love the sound it creates, very classic rock. On my les paul it sounds great especially on the treble pickup. Not as great on my telecaster, I think it reacts much better to humbuckers than single coil. It doesnt seem to offer as much of a boost on single coils, and it buzzes more, but the pickups on tele's have always been pretty loud. 
Does have some buzz but only on extreme settings, don't push both knobs past 3 o'clock at the same time, and it shouldnt be noticeable. I don't think you'll find a distortion pedal that can remain silent on maximum settings.                
Why don't these stupid things ever come with an AC plug? I'm not going to run on batteries forever. On the good side, solid metal not plastic like many pedals, obviously isn't falling apart like ever.                
Straight forward controls. Gotta love that. Doesn't take a lot of playing with the dials to find a great sound, and they respond even to incrimental adjustments.                
Perfect. Obviously built solid, extremely durable. No wonder they offer a 5 year warranty, no one ever needs it. I'm sure a fat man could jump up and down on it for five years without it breaking.                
I think Boss is just a little overpriced most of the time. Danelectro's are just as nice and way cheaper, although I suppose they are also made of plastic. This pedal, though, is very cheap relative to the Boss norm.                
I just haven't dealt with the company, haven't needed to.                
I don't think it's very desireable, that's why it's so cheap off the list price. Frankly it's fugly. However, I don't care as long as it works well.                
A solid pedal. Not the widest variety of sound but great at what it does. I think I'll nick name it captain crunch.                
Great distortion pedal.                
Easily adjustable.                
The box is well made. Can you break this thing?                
GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY!                
Boss is #1 in my book!                
Very attractive distortion pedal. Love the orange color.                
I will use this pedal from now on. I own an Ibanez fuzzy pedal that doesn't even compare.                
The sound quality is awesome, just like almost everything else about it. It really captures yoour nuances and holds them out there. I love NIRVANA, and considering that even Kurt Cobain used this and the DS2, it is the perfect pedal for grunge, alternative, and punk rock. I is perfect for my style of music and, I'm sure, for many others as well.                
This product is to good for "extra accessories." It's sound, sturdiness, easy storagebility, and overall simplicity makes up for anything you were hoping to get along with the stompbox.                
Amazingly sturdy. It's sturdiness is probably the best part.                
It was a steeeeeeeeeealllllll!!! Don't raise the price though, more people will buy it just the way it is! Don't change a thing! Leave this pedal exactly like it is, its PERFECT!                
It has a 5 year warranty, but I dont think I'll need it at all! Thanks though.                
I just love the orange color, it goes great with it's sound! It's also small and easy to store.                
This is the perfect distortion pedal! It's younger sister, the DS2, is a very close second!                
it kills the battery really quick. should come with the power adapter                
I'm trying to replace a Boss ME-20 multi-effects pedal, so I've been experimenting with overdrive & distortion pedals.  Boss has a great reputation, but I found the DS-1 to be thin sounding. Playing an American Tele through a Fender Blues Jr. I couldn't get a meaty sound out of this pedal & returned it after a few days of trying.                
It doesn't have have heavy ditortion at all only good for if you need a little distortion to you song                
Can't adjust sound the sound much at all 
hardly any features at all beside 3 nobs                
buit tough                 
Buy a digtech pedal                 
didn't need any                
Hardly even use it since i got my behringer amp                
Tja... das ist nicht so gut - that means "its not so good", for those who dont know German. Its not a great distortion pedal at all. It has a decent amount of distortion, but not enough for metalheads like me, and it has too much distortion for overdrivers. 
The tone knob has quite a bit of range, but still. When you turn the tone knob up a lot, its too tinny and thin; turn it down a lot, and it has no bite at all. You have to keep it at 12 or 1 o'clock for best results.                 
Theres three knobs, a Gain Knob, a Tone Knob, and a Level Knob... a bit run-of the-mill here. Especially considering that the three knobs are the EXACT same knobs used in other pedals.                
Well, with the lack of features, it easy to use, right? RIGHT? Just turn the knobs until you get a sound you like (might not happen with this pedal, though.)                
Spell it: B-O-S-S. Be, oh,es, es. Got it?                
Well, its only $40. Thats good. If youre on a budget, you could get this pedal OR you could get the DigiTech Hot Head (with better, heavier, less tinny distortion AND an actual EQ - fine, it only has  Low and High knobs, but it counts) for the same price. Take your pick.                
I have no clue, really, so Ill give it a five.                
Uh... no. Orange doesnt work too well here. Sorry.                
Parents, if your son started guitar lessons yesterday, this isnt a bad pedal. Players, if you have little money to spare, this isnt a bad pedal. But two things: first off, were looking of "good", not "not bad", so get the DigiTech Hot Head instead. Two, experts (and intermediate players) who have money to spare, STAY AWAY. Spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere, because this wont cut it.                
This pedal has really basic but cool distortion sounds. I really love it. I try to put my distortion to others though, and with this its kinda hard cuz its pretty basic, but it still has great distortion.                
theres really not much to talk about: tone, level, and uhh. i forget the other. ha. but yea, REALLY EASY TO FIGURE OUT.                 
Reallyyy easy to use and figure out.                 
pretty good i guess. its like metal, pretty sturdy. I've had it for like two years, and its still perfect.                
its great. same prices as everywhere. its affordable and sturdy. nothing tooo special though.                
I LOVE ZZOUNDS. i didnt use them for this, but ive been a long customer of theres, and id much rather give my business to them rather than the long-ruling empire of guitar center.                 
its orange.                 
its your basic distortion pedal. the original really. lots of guys have used this, and i can see why.                 
This pedal has a very loud sound                
Just three simple knobs                
Very easy to use, just click it and turn a knob                
This product is worth it's price especially if your a beginner.                
Bright orange, not hard to miss                
I'll pretty much keep this pedal for a while                
Not the best I've played with. But if this is your first pedal then I reckon you buy it.                
Limited, but decent enough for you to have some fun.                
Very easy to use.                
Boss is a great maker of effects pedals but this maybe isn't their best.                
Excellent price.                
Very Good                
I wouldn't buy it myself but it is good for beginners.                
This product is good for people who want to have fun. I wouldn't use it in a gig though.                
This is one pedal every guitarist needs in their arsenal. I prefer the sound to this over any product, other then the fulltone mosfet but thats almost 170 pounds more exspensive!                
go from blues t metal just by changing the pickup selector!!                
3 knobs. all that needs to be said                
had it over 4 years now and its never let me down                
Like i said i would pay over 200 pounds for this bad boy ad i picked it up for 30!                
never had to use it!                
its orange...                
there is a definate reason why steve vai and joe satriani use this. its amazing.                
doesn't change the actual dynamic of your sounds.                
Comes with level and tone and distortion, what more do  you need?                
three knobs, very simple layout.                
Easily made for abuse, or oops, won't hurt it. Never fails, and always works. Won't need a backup, made like a tank.                
compared to other units, a great price.                
Never had a problem with it.                
The sound isnt horrible but its extremely basic. This pedal is extremely overrated. The MArshall Guvnor 2 is a much better pedal-it has character, more gain, a better low gain tone, and a really nice eq. This pedal is not versatile at all.                
Basic features. Tone (useless), Distortion (not versatile), and LEvel.                
Its easy to get tones from it but the tones arent very good.                
Great quality, although again, MArshall guvnor is probably more durable.                
It is a pretty cheap pedal, but really, save up for the Guvnor-20 dollars extra.                
N/A                
I dont need this pedal-its obselete.                
It's an ok pedal for the price but its very bland.                
This was the first pedal i ever got and i am not going to ever throw it out. you can get any sound you want from the beatles to metallica                
doesn't have any fancy knobs or anything, just distortion. its built like a tank too.                
only 3 knobs. how hard is that?                
built like a tank. if you throw it out the window it won't break                
for 30 bucks you cant get a better distortion bedal                
never needed it                
i only got it because i had no idea about what amps and pedals were good (i just started playing). now that im good at guitar i realize how great it is                
this pedal, along with a good lead channel from an amp, can get any sound you want. this is the first pedal i ever got and its not going to leave my pedalboard. for 30 bucks you should get it anyway, whithout trying it out.                
Damn! Sounds better than a chainsaw!                
Not a lot to play around with.                
Thumbs up for the manual. However, the controls are so
simple you don't need a manual.                
It's a beauty inside and out.                
I've tried a few  pedals in it's price range and
nothing comes even close.                
No problems so far but I asked about it in the shop
and they said it's covered.                
When I saw it I was like a girl looking at a pair
of designer shoes - I had to have it.                
It's so good that if I ever go looking for a new
pedal it will be BOSS again.                
The tone is really good but it gives off TONS of white noise.                
Very simple                
all you do is step on it, just like any other                
all metal, it takes a beating                
Its a good pedal for the money.                
none needed                
I just needed a better ditortion pedal then the digitech grunge pedal, cause that one sucks.                
Its good but, wayyyy to much white noise, the humming is way to loud, bad for recording.                
THE GREATEST PEDAL EVER. Itr's best when you use it on a Fender Strat or Fender Mustang and maybe also a Fender Jaguar. It's just a Fender Pedal And i Love it                
it's great because it isn't complicated like the other pedals with more then 1 thousand of bbuttons on it                
easy...                
yup                
yes it really is but also need an wah wah pedal                
don't really know                
it's sexy                
uim i think the color may be changed                
I love the sound this gives although it took me awhile to find the right sound but after you play with it; it comes easy!                
All you need is in the box.minus a cord but yeah no pedal comes with those                
the ds-1 is extremely well made                
The best for the money                
Havent had a problem they look and feel pretty sturdy                
This litttle orange pedal will look good in front of any amp!                
I love this pedal                
i play mostly hardcore punk and metal and its great i also use and sd1 overdrive petal for palm muting but its a sweet ass pedal                
since it has 3 knobs it is easy to get the sound u love and it has a very wide varity of sounds                
it has good quality, very sturdy and durable                
come its only $40 for an amazing pedal no question                
no problems                
great distortion pedal to have, there are better ones out there but none that come even close in the price range                
I use it with my LTD Ec-50 and it sounds great. Rapes the overdrive on my marshall MG15CD. I only play metal(just about every kind)and it does a pretty good.It isn't the best sound out there, but for such a low price it's a steal.                 
I bought it for distortion, and that's exactly what I get.                
No clue, just bought it.                
Like I said before, it's a steal.                
Haven't needed it yet.                
Cool, but it need more effects                
yes, owners menu                
its cool                
y pay some expensive$                
more or less                
The DS1 captures every nuance and is really precise. If you explore its settings and tweak them around, the sound possiblities are almost endless!                
The DS1 is extremely well made. It's very, VERY sturdy and sounds good, too. I've been using it almost every night since February and the original batteries haven't run out yet! Although it has a 5 year warranty, I don't think I'll need it. It's just so sturdy; and yet, it's also light and doesn't take up hardly any room.This pedal is most definetly compatible with my style of music. It is an investment I'm truly proud of and this won't be the last BOSS or ROLAND product I purchase.                
It may be "bottom-of-the-line," but it's definetly worth more than it's price (please don't raise it though!).                
Well...it's orange and looks cool...It's just simple...and...easy to use and...just well made. It's simplicity and just overall greatness is what makes it awesome.                
I don't know what I'd do with out it...seriously!                
I've compared the DS-1 to just about every pedal since the early '80s and the DS-1 produces less noise and more bite for the money. I dont need all the EQ parameters of other distortion pedals that have hit the market over the years since I primarly use it with a Roland MC-202 MicroComposer for some badass acid lines. The tone knob is all I need, since any further EQ adjustments can be made from my mixer. As for playing guitar, I would naturally add a Boss EQ pedal at the beginning of the effects chain to gain all the characteristics most of these inexperienced kids seem to whine about. :p                
No accessories were included. All the features I need are there. I dont need any more or less, considering the price of the unit. If this pedal wasnt so good, it wouldnt be around after 27 years. It truly stands the test of time, being the most popular distortion pedal of all time.                
This unit (as well as all Boss pedals) is built like a tank! I've owned many other bands and Boss just cant be beat for their reliable quality construction that will last a lifetime when taken care of properly.                
Worth every last penny! Definitely more bang for the buck!                
I never had any problems with the DS-1 or any other Boss pedal for that matter, but I've ordered parts for other used Roland gear and had no problem with those orders.                
I definitely dig the orange color and the old style knobs that have remained the same since it first hit the market. The practicality is a must and I still get an erection just looking at it. ;)                
The DS-1 will always keep me satisfied. I wouldnt replace it, but I'd definitely supplement it with more effects units. This unit entirely meets my musical goals. If it were lost or stolen (which I highly doubt) I'd replace it with the same exact unit. What I like most about it is the fact that it gives me plenty of distortion with minimal noise. Theres conflicting stories that the early Japanese made units are better than the current units made in Taiwan, so I'll have to pick up a vintage DS-1 and compare for myself.                
its cool but its not for hard rockers it sounds tough                
Grungey sound   like nirvanas  "bleach" and "Nevermind"                
Best deal ever    cheap for a great product                
Kurt Cobain used this during the bleach and nevermind eras                
The Best  Pedal Money can buy, Boss hit the G spot with this Distortion pedal. What can I say about the DS-1X . (HOT BUTTER).  Boss has always made good pedals for years.  Can and will Boss ever top this pedal? Only time can tell. 
Thanks Boss for an amazing  pedal. and ZZounds for always being there for me.                
I got the wall adpator to keep from burning through batteries. Anyway, this makes a great complement to the Blackstar combo amp! I need nothing else for practice and jamming to blues, jazz, rock and some metal                
Ok...Ive played with the DS-1 and wanted to like it , I've owned it a few times, trying to dial in the sound and never could get a good sound out of it, NOT understanding how Satraini and Vai and Lynch have one in their Pedal boards, because i just don't hear any resemblance to a DS-1 in their Tone. I guess if i wanted a grungy tone or a Sex Pistols tone it would be great but I play Glam 80's Rock and there was no way that pedal was going to give me that tone. Also I have never found a distortion that you could go through a clean channel on a tube amp head and it sounds good, always lacking a bottom end and sounds terrible and trebly. I use a Blackstar HT Metal 100 Watt Head into a 4X12 cab for live shows and I cannot get a great distortion out of it and it's been depressing. I even recently tried the Boss GT-100 processor in hopes of a better tone, cool stuff but just don't have months to play with it and dial sounds in. The other day I even tired out a Boss MT Metal Zone pedal....cool but extremely buzzy. So in my depressing state, as a last ditch effort I watched an hour or so reviews on the new Boss DS-1X, on Youtube, it's getting great reviews and to be honest i was skeptical , but what did i have to lose? and to be honest, most of the reviews I was still skeptical.  $149.00 isn't pocket change for most of us But I ordered it two days ago and it showed up on my doorstep last night (litterally got it within 24 hrs!!) I plugged it into the smaller Roland practice amp I use here at the house with all the settling at 12 o clock...Not bad, not great, messed with the two EQ seting knobs and in the end was kind of depressed thinking it didn't sound that much different from the regular DS-1 ...in fact i was going to return it this morning. I got up this morning and decided to go over to our practice studio and plug through my main live rig before returning it.  I'M GLAD I DID!!!! with the settings ALL at 12 o clock this thing sounded like a complete monster!!! Thick tone, Bottom end, great distortion and something i really NEED ...great long sustain!!! it is everything the Metal zone is but without the buzzing tone and when you roll off your volume it cleans up well. Even with the distortion when you are at full volume, you can hear each note clearly, something i couldn't get with the Blackstar amp distortion or with any processor or distortion i have tried. I tweaked the lows up to both about 1-2 o clock, level at 12 o clock and distortion at 12 o clock and it sounded even better and full. Turning the distirtion to 3 o clock gave me that Metallica distortion and tone which 12 o clock still gives me plenty to play Sabbath!!! the versatility of this pedal is amazing. We are primarily Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Kiss, Crue, Poison, Great White covers as well as countless others and THIS is the pedal and tone i have been searching for for the past 20 years...YES it is THAT good!!!, we just started doing some Iron Maiden as well and this is gonna give me THAT tone too. I think BOSS has outdone themselves with this one...I might even buy another one to put away in case this one ever breaks LOL...I really love this thing...Buy one...a couple shows and it will pay for itself!!! Easily one of the best things i have bought in a very long time!!!                
I'm 58 and have boxes of pedals.  This is the best thing I've ever heard.  I give guitar lessons at a music store and all the guitarist / salesmen are getting one. 
You can not dail a bad sound everything sounds great. A little distortion sounds great.  A lot of distortion sounds great.   Any High and Low setting sounds great.  Better than amp distortion.  GET ONE!  VERY inspiring and RESPONSIVE.  Cleans up very nicely with guitar volume and soft picking.                
So...I am blown away at how versatile this thing is! Far more than I expected. First, it does what it is supposed to do, turns effects on and off in any order as you would expect. Second, you can change the order of your effects without moving pedals, run them in parallel when the input of one pedal would adversely affect the next pedal in your chain (priceless IMO), and switching is fast and quiet (no popping or delay). Third, You can use the MIDI function to control amp channel switching (I play through a Marshall JVM 410H). Every function of my rig is literally one step away. The best of a rack system without the rack and the simplicity of a pedal board. These cats thought of pretty much everything. You can even use the mute button as a bank up or down button so you don't have to run through the banks 1-5 before you can get back to the bank you want. Takes some reading to get going, but once you figure out the first patch the rest is pretty simple. Much more to this thing than meets the eye. I was pleasantly surprised!                
Possibility's are endless, is an understatement concerning this product  Everything about this product is brilliant well thought out for the giggin guy! whether you play at different clubs every weekend doin top 40 stuff,or out on tour, its everything I would need and more. 
The only down side to this product is the manual,I've been a Boss/Rolland user for 3 decades and they build great products for giggin guys but the manual is never the easiest.  Knowing how Boss/Roland manuals are,as usual,I took a good part of a sunday afternoon to learn it. Once you learn the ES-8 through all the manual, its a piece-O-cake. 
I highly advice learning it through the manual and knowing how to set it up before using the editor,this makes you a proficient pro musician in the middle of a set songs live on stage,when changes are needed...  highly recommend!                
I can't tell you how long I've been using BOSS and Roland products, but somehow I haven't thought of anything to say. Even though I've enjoyed their products throughout the years performing and recording with them. 
Well first it's affordable. After scouring the internet looking for a innovative, powerful switching system where the price was right, I finally came across the BOSS ES 8. Even though it arrived a little late in the pro switching system game, their incredible features and a doable price was just what the doctor ordered.      
Second, it's built like a tank and can handle the road for extensive touring. BOSS never makes flimsy products IMHO.
An important feature I admire the most is that no matter where you place pedals on your pedal board, the ES-8 will allow you to place each pedal in any order. Because of that and it's powerful MIDI features, I'm able to assign any of my fourteen pedals in any order in any patch and bank. Yes, fourteen. You don't have to settle for just eight pedals on your board because you see eight programable switches. 
As with all of there products, even though the programming is easy, the possibilities is limitless. After I've spent some time with it to see how best it could serve my needs in the studio and during live performances, I came to the conclusion that I've made the right choice purchasing this product. It's a beautiful tool that will be in my arsenal for some years to come.
With a full pedalboard, there is a lot of tap dancing and program switching involved in between songs or sections of songs. This thing has made everything so smooth. I program in tempos, pedal orders, etc and just step on one switch per sound and the es-8 handles everything. Love it, my tone is less noisy, the board is cleaner, and I switch like a pro. Love it!                
I needed a latching footswitch to control the effects on my Mackie mixer. This one seemed to fill the bill. The only problem I had was that the LED did not come on when I first tried the switch, before connecting it to the unit. The instructions did not actually cover this at all. So, on a hunch, I connected the switch to the mixer and turned it on. The LED functioned perfectly. The polarity switch gave me the option of either synchronizing the LED on the mixer and the LED on the switch or having the LED on the switch go on when the LED on the mixer was off, and vice-versa. Definitely worth the money.                
Had this on backorder awaiting Boss production and release. Received this and Propellorhead Reason 8 December 24th. WOW! What a Christmas this was for this old man! Pedal is great shape and the true beauty of this is no need for battery and no need for another Boss power supply. The supplied power splitter worked great with the PSA-120 power supply I use with my Boss ME-70 effects board and powers both devices. I currently use pedal A for reverb on/off and pedal B for bank switching with a TRS cable, but will experiment with other A/B cable options. Going battery free puts this well above previous Boss foot switches at a comparable price. I'm loving it and you will as well!                
great little pedal fits really good on the pedal board and works perfect for my needs.never needed manufacture support. and there's no sound and that's a good thing.                
Expression pedals and volume pedals are tricky, especially if you own a Nord Electro 3.  If you have one, it behooves you to buy a pedal that can serve as both an expression and an in/out volume pedal.  I prefer an extra large throw and something that is solid and large.  This Boss pedal is all of the above---the best one out there.  If you don't want a bulky pedal, don't buy this one.  It's built like a tanks and is almost as big.  I hate the small flimsy pedals, like the Roland EV5, or the ones that don't work properly, like the Alesis.  If your serious about performance and don't mind a big foorprint, just buy this...you won't be dissapointed.                
It's both an expression pedal and/or an in/out volume pedal.  It's nice to be covered both ways...actually it's essential.  Also the minimum volume is an prerequisite feature, which it's got.                 
If you can't figure it out, perhaps you're in the wrong field.                
It's metal contruction, built like a tanks.  I beat the crap out of mine for 3-4 years, didn't even keep it ithe box..just threw it around and into my gig bag....actually killed it.  Then I tried a bunch of cheaper pedals----don't do that.  They're mostly garbage.  I finally just bought it again and now I take care of it.  So if you beat the crap out of it, it will still give you 3-4 years.  If not, it might last forever.                
Yes, its not cheap.  But it's worth it.  One of those deals.  If you're a gigging musician, it's a good value.  Quality counts for a lot.                
not applicable                
Looks pretty good, although Boss in general is not something that would typically produce that much wood.  I generally prefer somthing with a more vintage look.  But I would submit that this category is fairly moronic.  Buy it because it does the job.                
It's the best one out there.                
Takes nothing away from the sound of my guitar. It's perfect for swells and changing volume when you can't stop picking.                
The adjustable volume in the closed position is very cool, you can make quick volume changes. The adjustable tension is a great feature, most volume pedals don't have enough resistance for me. I tighten this up so there is no accidental volume changes.                 
Does everything it's supposed to do and more.                
It's built like a bank vault. No worries about this pedal breaking.                
Worth every penny I spent on it.                
Haven't had to deal with them.                
The features I mentioned before are only available on this pedal.                
This will be the last volume pedal I will ever buy.                
Expression pedals are tricky---especially with the Nords and the Hammond clones. This is one of the few pedals that works with the Electro 3 and Hammond SK series.It's got a long throw and you won't kick it around because it's got some good aluminum beef. Never mind the cost---it's 10 times the pedal as the ev5.                
I was really surprised at the quality of this pedal. I originally bought it to be an expression pedal for my timeline pedal, but I have been using it mostly as a volume pedal so far. I am strongly considering getting another to be my expression pedal down the road. I would get this pedal again for sure. Built strong, glides up and down smooth and the tuner out on the left side is a god send. you can mute your guitar live and tune it up then slam it down and start playing again. awesome pedal great value!                
This is a great volume pedal but it does seem to lose a little treble when turning down. Still love it....                
This is where this pedal gets awesome. Using it aligned as a mooger fooger expression pedal is much fun and then back to its original duty as a volume pedal.. Adjusting the amount of volume you want to control is awesome and much needed as well as the tuner output.                
Easy as can be                
Its Boss! I have a bunch of boss stuff and its all incredible reliable. This is probably tougher than the pedals but I am not worried about it longevity at all. Probably outlive me.                
You get what you pay for. Its not the cheapest pedal in the world but its what you expect to pay for quality equipment.                 
N/A                
It is very sexy as far as volume pedals go... I really love it                
I do not expect to buy a volume pedal ever again. If a) it doesn't break or b) doesn't get lost or stolen. 
There is no reason for me to upgrade as this suits my style completely: This is not JUNK. It has a great action and smooth feel.                 
Noisy and scratchy. I never used its expression mode, but it was nice to know that it was there. My musical styles had nothing to do with my choice or uses of the pedal.The pedal was worthless for recording, disconcerting in rehearsal, annoying when demoing sounds in songwriting, and a big hassle on stage, the main reason that I junked it! If you can keep it quiet, good luck- it may get you through real world use for a while without major trouble- then again... replace the pot. with optics, duh!                
most useful features: stereo ins and outs; expession mode;minimum volume sensitivity adjustment.tuner jack; battery operation and power supply option. Least useful was the potentiometer, ruining its usefulness and wasting time, money, vbe- it's a big hassle!                
At first, it sounds okay- a few days later, expect the pot. to go out and leave you with a noisy clunker! iT'S EASY TO USE WHEN WORKING PROPERLY. THE ONLY BIT OF LEARNING INVOLVES THE EXPRESSION PEDAL, NO BIG DEAL. It's playable for keyboards and drum machines (my main uses), and I found it alright for guitar and bass.                
Made well enough except for the potentiometer- Which is like saying that a Volvo is well made except for having a sucky engine and transmission! Rreliable? NOT!!! It wouln't last nearly long enough, and it's cosmetically benign, if boring-undistinguished.                
No way!!!                
Yes. Customer service was 119% unresponsive, and impossible to reach!No friendliness or unfriendliness, just lacking effort and problem solving. I gave up, patience being finite...                
IF the pot. problem were fixed, I'd consider this pedal in its price range; otherwise, I'd pass it up!                
I used to own one of these noisy, scratchy-potentiometer duds. I admit to never having used the tuner jack, so I have no complaints there. The Ernie Ball pedals are quiet and study, a better choice. If you need to save money, buy a behringer cheapie or two and treat them gently! Morleys are fine, but also too fragile to leave home! I currently use a Visual Volume pedal that kicks butt! If I were to recommend only one volume pedal, I'd say to go with Visual Volume. They're worth the dough!                
Fantastic product! Easy to use...can't say enough good about it. One of the guys in the band let me use a Morley pedal, but I had some noise problems with it. Once the Boss pedal was connected, no more noise issues & everything worked great.                
No accessories...                
E-Z setup!                
Well-made...no problems.                
Haven't had any issues...service from zZounds is great, too. (I called zZounds prior to placing order on-line.)                
Definitely a practical addition to my keyboard setup.                
I'd definitely buy another one, whenever this one wears out. Boss was recommended to me as a producer of great products, & he was right. I play a Roland keyboard & had used a Bespeco volume pedal for over 10 years. I definitely prefer the Boss pedal & will stay with that from now on. I like the fact that the Boss pedal doesn't require a battery, as the Morley pedal did.                
I just received this Boss Volume Pedal and am using it with my Korg Krome and King Korg Synths. Decent pedal for the price. Nice feature to have two inputs and outputs so I can control volume of both of my keyboards through one pedal. Cuts down on needing a second volume pedal. Built good and so for no issues. I give it a solid A on value and quality.                 
Very happy and satisfied with the prompt delivery and the quality of the volume peddal excellant prices.   I will most assuredly order other merchandise from this company when needed. 
THANK YOU zZOUNDS
I purchased a keyboard from zZOUNDS and it had accessories and I ordered the foot peddal to use with it                 
Every thing with this product was convenient to use and understand.   The manuals were very helpful and informative.                
The product more than surpassed my expectations, and it seems more than adequate to use on the road or in your home.   It is an excellant looking pro instrument.                
zZounds had the best prices around.  I checked web site after web site they were the best.                
?                
This is it for me.  If anything happens to this keyboard I'll replace it with the same brand of keyboard.                
I have a Dunlop JH fuzz and this FZ-5 with its three non-Dunlop emulations. All four are different. The Maestro setting was so off the wall that I had ZZsounds replace the pedal. What I ended up with is a Maestro setting that at least doesn't totally cut out but who can tell the difference. If you want fuzz know what fuzz you want, they are all different.                
For whatever reason, though I have been playing guitar for many years I've never bothered to put anything into the  FX loop other than a chorus or delay pedal. Recently I've decided to lose the multi fx pedal I use and go straight into the amp. Well I wasnt able to get close to the tone I wanted so a friend suggested I try a GE-7 through the FX loop of my amp which is a Valveking 112 into a Sheffield 4x12. Bought one here at ZZ and proceeded to try it out in the FX loop.. WOW!! That's about all I can say. I don't even need the 4x12 any more which makes gigging so much easier. This pedal brought a low end(though modified) amp like a VK112 into Mesa territory and I kid you not. Slight bumps and slight cutting of certain frequencies on this pedal  and  it turns your amp into a monster. I have been playing for over 25 years and have owned many expensive and big name amps but this pedal into a cheap amp competes with and actually tops some of them easily!! I can say in all honesty that the only reason I'd ever buy another amp is as a backup and to see what this pedal can do to another amp.                 
tip to make the sound better? just study the ranges - frequencies are sensitive - adjust to suit your need, your taste                
as ever - boss pedals are STURDY, strong to withstand all road conditions, weather even..                
good enuf for a great gear                
haven't gotten in touch w/ the company which made the boss ge7                
the color bothers me, light yellow, blue might be better, but its purely my opinion - my choice of color.
i lusted for this product when i found what it can do, its a great gear to pomp my performances
color versus the use and its contribution to me - i say id buy it even if its baby pink... :-)                
nope, i dont have a need as of now for other products- the ge7 equalizer works well w/ my boss bass chorus and flanger, and the best it can stand alone w/ my yamaha APX3.                 
Really helps to shape your tone, or is awesome as a solo boost in your effects loop.                
It has more then enough bands and the level slider is a plus.                
As long as you know what EQ does there no no learning curve for this pedal.                
Like all Boss pedals. Built to last a long time.                
Well for a simple EQ I'd rather pay a bit less.                
never had to deal with Boss directly. I guess that is good, never had a problem with any of their products.                
I like the look of all the Boss pedals.                
I use mine as a boost for my guitar solos. If it were lost or stole I would replace it immediately with the same item.                
Great product. The only thing wrong is you need ear plugs after a while. The pitch is really high and it slices through your ear. I use it through the ex loop in the back and not in front of the amp. And I would like to hear it with a bbe maximizer, something that bring out highs and lows naturally. I think both of them together would sound cool.                
It could of come with an adapter.                
I used it a lot when I first got then had it in a closet for a long while.  Just recently I started using it again and it still works fine after being just thrown in a dust filled closet.                
There is a bbe maximizer for the same price and I would rather use that.                
To me it still hold up even with all these new eq's and other big bottom and high enhancments.                 
One word: TONE.  This thing is awesome, it can be used for any type of music.  If you have a distortion pedal, and you're just not getting enough tone, buy this.  It can make any sound sound sooo much better.                
Good, i guess, i dont really care, i just care about the sound                
You're gonna have to play around with it alot until you have the sound you want.                
it wont break, its built like a tank                
its a bit pricy, but worth every penny                
i dont know, never dealt with them                
Equalizers are just awesome.  You can get great tone out of it, no matter what kind of music you play.  I recommend this product to anyone who needs that extra 'oomph' to your sound.  I don't know how long this will last, but when it does die out (if it does), I'll get another equalizer, but probably that twin pedal equalizer that Boss makes.                
It helps other effects to sound more effective in certain ways of playing.                
This pedal really works for solos and boosting your sound during the chorus part of the song you played. If you play rythmic leads in the verse it also help to enhance your guitar sound more clearer and brighter by simply adjusting the Level slightly way up. It also makes my modulation effects sound great in some certain ways in my own taste of listening.                
I have eight Boss Pedals so far, I like them all not only for the sound but also in quality they can take a proper abusive use in stage or in the garage. They don't broke easily like most other pedals. They last long-including the sound never changed stay theysame the way it is.                  
I give a 9 on value because for me a $100.00 retail price is a bit quite expensive to its usefullness. If this pedal supply also power to other boss pedals like the NS-2 its more better but its not. A $79.00 or $89.00 for this one will be a great value overall.                  
Im curious before how this pedal really shape the sound in whole my set-up but once I own it really help in certain ways in making your sound more effective in stage or during a practice or even in your room.                
This quite expensive for a 7-band EQ but its Boss dont worry it will last for a long long time..                 
I use this pedal to increase the distorion pedal i also have. It makes a HUGE difference in sound when it is on. My guitar comes through cleaner, louder and more powerfully.                
I've gone through the VG8 to the GR30 and the Boss GP10 finally ties it all together. VG sounds, plus regular preamp, any blend thereof plus great effects all easily configured with a USB editor. All sounds coming out of my regular guitar amp mono. I use it on all my electric gigs now, 1-2-3 a week. Love it!                
I have owned a VG-8 and a GR-55 and this thing rocks with better tracking, better sounds and an overall smaller package.                 
Unfortunately, while it is a good idea it fell short of my needs and I will be returning it today.
Some the biggest "issues" for me are that, for the price, there are too many limitations when selecting effects for a given patch -if you want a compressor, you can't have something else, etc...  In this day and age, processing power is cheap and it seems that BOSS is deliberately "dumbing" down products for marketing reasons.  IN addition, the AMP and EFX affects both the guitar input and the modeller so, you can't have two separate processing.  Huge shortcoming for me.
The tracking varies widely between WAV Synth and SYNTH, the former having the worse tracking of the two.  But, since it also has the most varied programming parameters for synth-based sound creation you'll want to use it instead of the simple SYNTH modeler.
Guitar modeling is OK but, not as good as other units for sure - my Variax has a more realistic emulation of the various guitars, it has MORE models and MORE parameters to boot (such as pickup position, tilt, etc...) - and you can still hear a bit of a microphonic effect even with the GK pickup which is what they recommend using.  
Finally, their EDITING software is buggy at best and in some cases it and/or the drives don't install properly - the web it full of such complaints. IN my case, the installation program would hang even though Windows message would say, "You hardware is installed and ready to use" - well, BOSS's own program thought otherwise so, I couldn't get it to work on XP PRO, Vista or Win 8.1 - and once you read the super-long list of "issues" on Roland's own website you have to wonder how they couldn't find a capable company to write the drivers and editor for them.
I am returning mine today as I have just received the RMA - hopefully, something better will come along soon.                 
Pretty good, still needs some tweaking to get it to track just right - Can't really do what I wanted to do with this unit, Horns, was my main need - this unit doesn't fill it.GR-55 may be a better fit                
The reason I knocked the the sound quality a star and a half is because the preset sounds aren't EQ'd well at all. Compare it in videos to the Zoom and you'll see what I mean. That being said, once you get into it and 1)start tweeking yourself or 2) goto the Boss Tone Central you'll be fine. Boss Tone Central has some FANTASTIC user presets by pro guitarists. Once I found those I was very happy with sound quality, but you'd think they could of used some of these for their presets.                
The reamping feature is Dope and works great. At least with Reaper, which I also recommend. Had no issues getting the GT001 to talk to Reaper, easy as pie. Having the mic input it great and seems to work very well. The mic presets aren't super useful, but there not terrible either. Could use a few more bass presets...                
Easy to use, had a little trouble getting Boss tone central up and running, but once I did, can't live without it. But as far as just plug and play and jam, works like a charm. Menus are pretty straight forward.                
The knobs are fake metal plastic, but other than that its alright...would it really have broken the bank to throw some cheap metal in there?                
I compared this to several other items, the zoom being the one that almost won because the presets are really good. But, I use this for home desktop recording mostly and the BOSS GT001 is just superior to the zoom in that regard. The mic port with phantom power helped seal the deal, but the reamping feature is pretty sweet too...and once I found Tone Central the preset thing was a non issue.                
Haven't needed them so far.                
For the price point and for what I'm using it for, I'm super happy with it. I wish they had better presets right out of the box, BOSS if you are listening, maybe get some guitarist in there and let the engineers design the box and then lock them in the closet while the guitarist make the presets. But, thank goodness for Boss Tone Central, cause there are some great presets on there.                
Excellent Desktop recording solution.                
Very nice desktop unit for using with your DAW of choice. Use it with Presonus Studio One. it sounds great and easy to hook up with studio one. The amp settings are endless. it is the Boss GT-100 in a desktop version without foot pedals.                
The Boss GT-001 is a very good effects processor.  The Boss Tone Studio on line software app the connects via USB makes this processor very easy to use and find the tone that you are looking for. Although most patches are for Rock or Metal, there are several from associated Roland artists that can be used for other music types. The Roland companion software makes it very easy to modify or customize a tone or create your own tone and save to the library.  I definitely recommend this unit for anyone looking for a very useful guitar effects processor for their home recording studio.                 
I did not buy the Boss GT-1 from zzounds, but none the less this processor is amazing. Within the first half hour o was nothing but smiles from ear to ear. I am running this through two amps, one being a blackstar ht 40 and other being a roland blues cube stage 60. It sounds fantastic ran through two amps simultaneously. I coulsnt be happier.
Only issuse i habe with it is that i wish it had an on off switch instead of pluging and unpluging for the power.                 
I've had many effect pedals over the decades. I decided to buy the GT-1 and am very happy with it.The sound and especially the overall design.it's very easy to use                
   I have owned the Boss ME-33, Gt-6, and just recently upgraded to the Boss GT-100.  So because of that, I am only going by what I know.  This GT-100 has really impressed me...With the ease of use, the looks, and the TONE!!  I did a lot of research before pulling the trigger on this unit.  I looked at the POD 500HD, the Zoom G5, and the Mustang Floorboard.  To be honest, It was a hard choice between the POD500HD and the GT-100....but after receiving the GT-100 and plugging it in....It won me over Immediately. Online you will find forums where they
talk about the POD500HD being better as far as Amp Modeling....Don't let that fool you.  My Boss GT-100 sounds perfect!!  Yours will too!!  Manufacturer support?..I recently called them to assist in a programming situation, they were very helpful, and I didn't feel like I was "imposing" on them. zZounds....As always, your company and staff are wonderful, Thanks for everything.                
The Boss GT-100 is well made and looks awesome! The buttons are solid and you can't ask for better pedals. They are super quiet and sturdy. The dual display is great and it doesn't take too much time to figure it all out without having to read the manual. If I had to rate "User Friendly" from 1-10, 1 being "Difficult" and 10 being "Easy", I would give the Boss GT-100 a solid 8. The Boss GT-100 does lack a nice computer interface. The one that comes with it looks like it came out of Windows 95. Roland should definitely do something about that. Other than that, the GT-100 will give you hours of experimenting with endless sounds and tones... You're only limited by your own imagination.  Enjoy!      
Just got this pedal. Moving on from my GT-10. The 10 was great for studio recording via the digital IO. The 100 is a great improvement in a lot of areas, however; I'm not sure why BOSS left the SPDIF IO out of this. The software is similar to the Line 6 HD500X, but this pedal has the tones and sounds dialed in and it really doesn't take much tweaking ( if any). One last thing: I really l wish that all of these manufactures would emphasize the clean and jazz types of tones as much as they do the metal and rock style. Not all of your customers play that style.                
I have used individual pedals in the past and had grown used to them, but I always had my eye on this unit and decided to try it out and I really like it. If you decide to buy it I recommend messing with this thing for a couple of days, I made a couple patches that I like and use them all the time, to find your sound there are lots of digital knobs to tweak and pedals to shuffle around but this efx unit once you dial it in is worth every penny. Don't get frustrated, take your time and it will be well worth it.                
yes i bought mine here on zzounds 4 payments verses 3 elsewhere what can i say this thing is a monster and ive been writing a wider range of music than i did with my korg this will separate the men from the boys .not a fan of the exp.peddle as a wah ill stick to my morley. planing on getting a second for later on                
I play at my church on Sunday, so I needed something that could handle anything we do. D
I did have lots of money for a good tube amp that was large enough to complete with a b3 organ, keyboards, drums and bass. I also play keys as well. Using the gt100 through a keyboard amp is great, plenty of volume. Nice warm tones. Dose everything pretty good.                  
Just awesome. I've had just about every pedal out there and they were just ok. This one is amazing. I would recommend trying to make your own tones before purchasing some from people                
I picked this up knowing it was at the end of it's market life, but I wanted to finally own one.  COSM is starting to feel a little old, but it's still an amazing pedalboard.   The amp modeling is good, especially the clean tones.  The distortion can get a little "digital" sounding, but it's still very usable.  The effects are top notch, especially the delay and reverb.
What attracted me to this product was the routing options, specifically USB.  I do a lot of home recording on my DAW and an underappreciated feature of this board is the ability to record both a dry and wet signal to your DAW at the same time.  Reamping (routing the signal out of your DAW back into the device for processing after recording) is a great tool and something that is not found in a lot of boards.  It really gives this kit an extended life off the stage and in the studio.
6 years after launch this is still a great product!                 
Recently got the GT100, and Im really impressed how Boss has done its homework to improve the GT100 and make it really easy to use out of the box. Major upgrade in overall tone and ease, and its a snap to figure out how to use it. Definitely get this unit, dont waste money on other junk. Boss is the best DNA out there!                
First off I am not a professional and I do not tour.  I bought this for my Bass Guitar and although designed mainly for guitar, I was able to tweak and create some excellent patches for my bass!
This thing is rock solid with metal construction and I don't feel like I need to be gentle (I am though). 
As far as ZZ Sounds, get response, the item shipped as promised and arrived when scheduled.                 
The GT100 is a huge leap from the GT8, my last Boss processor.  I also own 2 other effects processor currently ( Line 6 HD500X & Digitech RP1000).  Although I love all 3 of them and they all sound great, the GT100 does have unique features the other 2 dont.  That's why I have 3 effects proccesors.  
The only complaint that I have about the G100 is that there is a learning curve when making patches.  I feel that the Line 6 & Digitech stuff is easier to program.
I just purchases from zZounds the Boss SY-300 and I can't wait to run in withe the GT100.                  
I was looking for a multi-efx pedal that could handle both acoustic and electric guitars. You'd think that in 2012 that should be easy, right? Well, not really.Let me start with the good stuff: The unit is SUPER easy to use. They really did a great job with the GUI - I haven't had to read the manual for any of its features and I was able to get into in-depth programming within a very few minutes of unpacking the unit.The clean sounds are honest and well defined - the reverb is ok but, not as good as the old BOSS SE50/70 for example - why??? I like the fact that the EQ has both LOW and HI freq FILTERS - a GREAT addition and it's available at all time.In essence the unit has a number of effect that are always available such as OD/DS, COMP., EQ, AMP, NR, DLY, CHR and REV. Then, there are 2 EFX modules which can be used to add a number of other effects. My gripe is that TWO is not always enough and I feel BOSS should have added at least a third.I am very picky about my sound so, I was really waiting to see how it would perform on clean patches, for both acoustic and electric. I have to say that I was ale to program a set of patches for my nylon and steel string acoustic that sound really natural, open and polished. No nasal overtones at all. I am impressed.I also like the clean patches I was able to program for my solid and hollow body electrics, for pop/rock and jazz. Was I don't like as much are the overdrive sounds. Just not convincing to me. To make them more palatable I had to really mess with EQ, compression and amp models.About the amp model: they do NOT sound anything like the amp they purport to represent, that's for sure. You will have to forget the "model" and imply listen for a sound you like. However, if you expect the "blackface" or "super tween" to sound anything like the real guys...forget it! Not even close. Just accept the models for what they are, not for what they are supposed to be :)For a "pro" product this unit lacks both on inputs and outputs. Should have had XLR as well as inputs for additional guitars. A big shortcoming in my opinion. Considering the Line 6 HD gives you that much and that all routing is programmable per patch, the BOSS lacks in this dept.Also lacking is support for more external pedal/switches - there is ONLY ONE, and you either plug an EXPRESSION pedal OR foot switches, but NOT both at the same time! Why? And only ONE AMP control jack - again, totally unacceptable these days. Further, no SPDIF out - again, the POD HD is way ahead of the BOSS GT-100 in this area.I was so disappointed that I had actually called Zzound to return it! However, I decided that accepting its limitations would allow me to have a unit that would sound great for CLEAN sound, for both my acoustic and electric guitars.I just have to wonder what BOSS what thinking when they designed this. They have been in the game for a long time and certain missing features should have been incorporated in this unit from the get go. It amazes me that they unit was designed without such basic features as an XLR out!                
I purchased the Boss GT-100 based on internet and YouTube reviews, which were very impressive. However, when I plugged-in and played-it, it sounded and felt like a cheap toy. Obviously an entry level floor processor mostly based on 80's era sounds. Also, the built in expression pedal was not working properly with some presets. I called Zzounds customer service and they instructed me to return it. The return process was very easy and hassle free. In my opinion....I do not recommend this product to any gigging musician. What I do recommend is to visit your local music store and try out the product until you're satisfied and then do the purchase. Internet review may be deceiving!!                
Sounds just like my Marshall. Also sounds like my twin.Very good rich tone. Actually responds to your pick like a tube amp.                
Efx are great. The ability to assign efx to the extra switch. Momentary or latching Can assign a different amp to each channel                
Very easy                
Built really tough. Something i have come to expect from boss.                
Worth every penny.                
No need to call                
Versatile and very easy to use.                
I purchased the gt 100 5 weeks ago. Im a full time musician and perform over 200 shows a year. i have always used Marshall amps and the maintenance has always been expensive and a pain to deal with. i run the gt 100 through a rocktron velocity power amp and a Marshall 412. It sounds amazing. Several local guitar players are looking to purchase and retire their tube amps after they have heard it. I have used the pod xt also the digitech rp500. The boss blows both of them away.Spend the extra money and get the boss gt100 it is superior in every way.                
Honestly idk what I was thinking when I bought this... Over priced and hard to use. It's interface is absolutely atrocious. If I'm gonna spend a lot of money on a unit, I'll buy a Line 6 Helix or Fractal. I love Boss pedals on there own, but this is just annoying.                
 I had line 6 hd 500 and rp 1000 and the boss gt 100 is the best out there for multi effects unit out there and the rp 1000 is the second best unit out there                
BEST PEDAL ON THE MARKET                
I like the BOSS GT-10 best because it has individual buttons for each of the effects so I can instantly see which effects are on/off (without having to scroll through a menu system) and edit each effect as well.  With the BOSS GT-10 you can instantly install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  BOSS GT-10 Patches will not instantly install into a BOSS GT-100, JS-10, or JS-8 which makes you have to manually enter in all of the BOSS GT-10 patch settings.                
Amazing sound quality, anyone that says different has no clue what theyre talking about, doesnt know how to use it properly or just a L6 HX fanboy (troll).  Im using a Kiesel Vader V6X with Lithium pickups and an Alto TS312 pa speaker and Audio Technica AD-1000x for sound. Main AIRD output set to recording, IRs selected within each patch.  Definitely not the easiest multi Fx to learn but well worth it IMO. The ability to switch patches with no delay without cutting off the previous patch is absolutely a must have in my opinion.  You can customize every aspect of the signal chain, even choose the mic and placement down to the cm. I even loaded a 24bit Patch of the Mega Boogle Rectifier built for the hx just to test, sounds great but 32bit AIRD is definitely a noticeable step up when listening through high quality headphones. FYI, a lot of reviewers of this product only purchased it to review and return it. They had not spent the time to learn the product and now spread false information about it. If it can be done this unit can probably do it.                
Before I purchased the GT-1000 I was skeptical because of the reviews and a lot of people I spoke pushed the Helix. But I noticed they're mostly using humbuckers and power chords. I play a Fender Strat and I do enjoy overdrive at times. But I spoke with Boss by email and told them my concerns about the amp models between the GT-1000 and Helix and they told me ....The GT-1000 is to compete with the LINE 6 Helix and we suggest quality not quantity of sound is most important to BOSS. So I purchased the GT-1000 and I tell you I absolutely love it. It is so easy to navigate through I had no problem getting usable sounds and I was able to duplicate the entire tone setup of my pedal board which has 9 pedals on it for different songs I play at gigs and I plan to use it live on Oct. 3rd. 2018 at Ceasers Palace LV for a live test run. I am very happy with the tone and Im able to get any sound that my pedals do and much much more thank you Boss your sound has been proven musician, garage band, bedroom and Live worthy once again.                
It's awesome, simply awesome. The size factor alone makes it a winner for me. What makes it a loser for me is that Boss did not include the dang power supply. Sure, I can and will (because I have to) order a PSA 120S 500mA power supply for this unit for @ $30.00, but if Boss was halfway thinking this through it probably would cost the consumer far less. All in all, zZounds was off the chain as far as customer service and speed in getting this little adapter-less piece of Heaven to me where Musician's Friend had me on hold for 7 minutes then hung up on me. 3 stars overall because of no included power supply. What were they thinking?                 
This a great pedal, though I would have to say most of the presets I wouldn't use I do see some players might find some of the stranger presets something they could use. I do like the ease of use, the pedal is really easy to configure, the options for configuring the pedal are a lot better then I expected. It's really versatile, I have been using the Boss GT-1B Pedal more then my Sansamp  in certain situations. I highly recommend the Boss GT-1B Bass Multi-Effects Processor. For the money it's a no brainer                
OK so loved the demo's and description. This does not come with any songs, only jam tracks. I had trouble loading iTunes from my collection. (convert to mp3 or wav) but once I call boss and spoke with tech support, (peter swiadon) they really care, help and stand behind their products, I was off and jamming. This unit is awesome! Practice, take it w/you play along your favorite songs, cancel out guitar, bass or vocals, record, slow down. Family and fiends always asking me to bring and play. Its like having your own band in a small portable box. Enough, sound for a small gig or plug into speakers. Would like to see a travel bag for this, it's made for that.                
The eBand JS-10 is a fun tool in my guitar practice arsenal. The sound is very good and can be used in small settings (such as a living room or Den etc.) to entertain friends. The features I like most are the wide variety of tones available and the ability to set your tones. I also like the size of the unit. It sits comfortably on the corner of my computer desk and can be moved to any area of my house with no trouble at all (actually easier than transporting any of my guitars). I like that it doesn't need to connect my computer sound system so I can play audio or video files on my computer and my music through the JS-10. I have a UX2, which I love, that I can't play with my audio and video philes without distorting the sounds. The SJ-10 has features that I haven't even begun to explore and I'm looking forward to using those as I develop my playing skills. Don't worry! The directions are fairly easy and clear on the use of each feature. I just like to explore one feature until I become fully adept at it and then move to the next. As a practice tool it is as good as it gets and if you don't have a lot of space it is even better. I takes up very little space and can be stored easily if you don't have a practice room just for your playing. Note: I would not have rated manufacturer support because I have not had to deal with any issues as yet but I was not allowed to not rate it at all. So I gave it 5 stars just to be positive.                
"Must have" is an overused expression. It should be reserved for appropriate use.  That said, if you play electric guitar, even casually, the JS 10 is a "Must Have".  
Of all the guitar related techno-gizmos that I own, none of them come close to hours logged on the JS10.  It's the ultimate practice tool (want to really learn the Pentatonics beyond the box?) and in-house performance tool.  The developers left no stone unturned.....If you read the product description you'll ask yourself, how can this all be possible for $400?  Well, it is!  My first unit was the JS-8...I thought that was the bomb.....then upgraded to the JS-10.....better yet.  I look forward to the JS-12 if that ever becomes a reality.  
So if you're an "at-home"  player that would like to sound like you're playing in a band and at the same time have multiple ways to improve your practice sessions, don't hesitate to treat yourself to this little gem.  Boss just nailed this item, dead on!
Over and Out
It's been really fun to just scroll through songs and play along. I have discovered my weaknesses and strengths when it comes to solo's. I'ts easy to operate and plenty of options. I haven't even scratched the surface as every time I get ready to start discovering I get caught up in playing instead. Definitely good for learning to improvise and stay in key....I'm glad I got it...Thanks Pay as you Play !!!!                
The JS 10 is easy to use, sounds great, and has many styles of music available to help find and get to know any holes in your theory or technique. It's plug in and play simplicity makes it a good tool for someone as averse to programming as I. I can't say enough about how good it is!                
I can't stop playing my guitar, there is so much to do with the Boss JS-10 it's unbelievable. This was one of my best investment ever I recommend this to everybody that needs help practicing.                
Excellent box and sounds, with the ability for me to download my own backing tracks to play with. As I'm a One man Band, as it were, its great for practice and I can also use the JS-10 as a USB user interface. I just got the unit so Ive only just begin to scratch the surface. zZounds as always gives me the support I need, and allows me to Play As I Pay like nobody else on the Music Store Circuit.                
I'm really a tube snob but needed a small amp fro practices and after trying out Orange and Vox I read the reviews and decided on this one. Totally exceeds my expectations! For a solid state amp it's just unbelievable! put it on the Brown sound and crank the gain and it sounds just about as good as my Marshall. Budda and Blackstar! Just a monster. Plus great acoustic sound. A total winner!                
If you are looking at this review then you are either just starting your search or have done some homework and are seeing what others think of the Boss Katana. Here is my experience.  I had read that this Boss Katana was a non Tube tone machine that not only sounded great out of the box but when plugged into a PC/MAC offered the ability to customize your sounds.   I found all of this to be true!   I own a few Tube amps.  My favorite is a Vox AC15.  I'm not saying the Katana is better or worse but on its own,  The Katana sounds amazing.  Crispy Clear tones to ripping crunch,  you will find a sound that works for you.  I ended up going with the Katana 100 over the 50 because the 100 offers the following additional features:  effects loop, Presence control knob, and 8 tone settings (version 2 software).  As far as volume goes,  the 100 Watt is like, Crazy Loud.  Thankfully both the 100 and 50 offer a master volume control and amp wattage settings. You can run the 100 on .05 watt, 50watt, or 100watt with no tone loss.   The Katana, again, is not a tube amp but it does have characteristics of breakup just like a tube provode and just sounds amazing.   To me,  I don't care what is under the hood,  if it sounds amazing and offers ear candy to me and others then problem solved.  Get a Katana and you'll be happy.                   
No kidding.  I've had several tube amps and the boss Katana 100w 1x12 sounds about as good as any of them.  No kidding.  Where this thing excels is its ability to sound great at any volume, the effects, light weight, cost, solid state durability, and USB interface.  
I checked out blackstar I'd, line 6 spider 5 and fender GT.  Non of these felt like a tube amp.  The Marshall code was the closest but isn't in the same class as the katana.  You can roll the volume knob back and the sound cleans right up.  It's loud as s#!% for a solid state amp.
Could use a tuner but that's it's only flaw.                  
Boss actually did it. I use A.R.T. DST 825`s 830`s and 8080`s.Manufactured from 97-99. They were over a grand new. Now they are aging and I have been looking for a suitable sound to give my aging non-repairable amps a rest. The Boss is slightly not as warm. But this amp is almost an exact duplicate sound wise. I have owned many Marshall tube amps including custom stacks that they only made a 200 limited run. I owned a Dumble modified 1974 Hiwatt Dr201. If I were to keep going this page would be full. This amp even produces tube harmonics. Where I goofed, I bought the 100 watt 1x12. So now I am going to decide to buy the 2x12 or the 100 watt head. Maybe even both? Look if you want a responsive amp? That will show your talent. Grab one. And I would recommend the 100 watt. They may say no, but there is a difference in sound between the power settings and the 100 watt setting is the best one. At times you can hear it is digital but you have to really have an ear. Definitely worth it and actually more. Get One or two!!! I will give support a 5 but will not need them. P.S. I ran every note I play through this amp , Near perfect sound not muddy or the digital fall apart most digital amps have. It took it. Made very well and the tilt foot is a good idea. I know my old Fender from 65-66 had the tilt arms, But Boss put lots of thought into this amp!                
This amp is the ultimate game changer. All those elusive tones I've been chasing have been captured. I've been giging with the Katana 100 for a little over a month now and my jcm 2000 half stack, Fender twin, and dual showman have taken a back seat. Light, powerful, awesome tones. I could go on and on. Tube dudes, stop tripin,  this is the best amp ever. Ordered Thursday and it came the next day. zZounds you da bomb.                
I've been looking for this amp for quite a while. I started with the line 6 modeling pedals, roland modeling pedals, something was missing, so I switched to a peavey modeling amp and all fell short. I was looking for a warmth, a chunk, a drive, whatever you might call it, it's a sound made by a tube amp, that just touching the strings you feel that power, that drive. Well, boss nailed it with this amp. My recordings are way clearer, now my guitar sounds with a professional grade. I bought a blemished version, I really didn't see anything wrong with it and saved big.  I also used the zZounds 4 payments option. Was shipped and received fast.                
I already have the 50 watt version which I love, but I needed something that has more push and headroom. The 100 watt with the single 12" speaker fits my needs perfectly. I like the added benefit of the presence control when using Humbuckers. People say these Katanas are digital, but they're not. The effects are, but the quality of said effects are fantastic. I'm so happy that the Katana has a built in Blues Driver. Excellent boost and overdrive. The overdrive channels are absolutely great and perfectly usable. I've read reviews that the Katana line doesn't model "boutique" amps very well. That's actually the beauty of this line. They have their own sound. Get into the sneaky amps if you want to model some amps. I fully enjoy the Katana's own unique sounds. The amp has plenty of power and clean headroom for most venues. It'll plug straight into a PA system if you need more sound coverage and saturation. I'm thrilled with this line of amps.                
I haven't done much if any reviews for anything ever. But this amp is definitely worthy of a few mins to hopefully help someone that may be thinking about this amp. I've had Line6 spiders, the Peavey Vyper when they first came out. Marshalls, the 5150 etc. all are freaking awesome but for a family guy that doesn't even play out, they're overkill. Hell, I recently sold off my newer Vyper2 after this little beast arrived at my door. The Katana sounds fantastic. Period. No matter what type of tone you're looking for, it's in this amp. You know that you like at least like some of the Boss pedals. Don't lie! Though I don't use many effects myself, there's enough to come up with any sounds you might want. At the same time, you don't need a degree in engineering to access everything. Plus, I don't need a thousand presets. Four should be enough for us mere mortals. The ability to make and save some to pull in with the software is plenty for me. It's also super easy to doThe software is straight forward. Yes, there's 55 pedals you can download and play with, and they're all easy enough to dial in. There is a setting in the interface that will put your effects in before or after the power section. And yes, you can absolutely hear the difference. Honestly, i did do a little reading on some of these pedals to help me really understand what they're really meant for and HOW to use them for myself. Effects loop is great to have. The aux in is what it is so don't expect too much when playing along with your device of choice. The output sounds good enough for basic use. A serious home studio type of person isn't looking to buy this product. That's fine. But this amp can get the job done. The 12" speaker seems good. Your neighbors could potentially hate you when you turn this thing up. Which brings me to the power selector. Basically, you can have that cranked up to freaking 11 sound at extremely low volumes. That's something that IMHO has been a feature that other amps in this category just suck at. Mine stays on the .5 watt setting most of the time. It's still loud enough to drown out most people's little sound bars and what not. My wife and kids can back me up that, lol. 50 watts will do with a drummer and bass player. 100 watts is the way to be, just as long as your other guitar player isn't bringing a half stack to the party, lol. This model has only one speaker so, duh... it will only get but so loud. Certainly the 2x12 is louder. It's not rocket science. It would have been nice to include a footswitch. Though for $99, it's cheap enough to buy later. It's interesting to me that you can add two expression pedals to that footswitch too. Though most of us are going to use our wah of choice here anyway. Am I right? Yes, i am. lol. I suppose I'd be open to getting one to use as a volume pedal. But that's why i put a treble bleed circuit in my Les Paul too. I only put a little electro harmonics boost and vox wah in front. I've tried a cpl if delays and chorus thru the loop. They sound great as expected but the delays built in are enough for my use. I'm not a modulation effect guy myself. At the end of the day, this amp should really please anyone. No matter their chosen genre of music. Best practice amp with built in effects available today. It takes pedals great. If you have a multi effect unit, go with the four cable connection. The damn Katana is the hot lick. Check it out!                
From Super clean to Brown, I love the sweet tones this amp produces. It has plenty of power and sounds fantastic at any volume. With all the built-in effects and Boss Tone Studio I am able to fully customize and set up 8 presets for quick access.                
I'm thoroughly enjoying this amp. Haven't gigged with it yet but i love the sound and effects. Struggling a bit with the online ToneCenter editting of the effects, but the amp itself is great.                 
It is true that this amp can put out very good tone- but it is limited. All of the extras that they added are not very good- think of this like a 2 channel tube amp without the tubes -if you want that then buy it...if you want to use it and set up a varied array of channels and sounds to play in a band that does a wide variety of music then this will not work for you.  I thought I was upgrading from the fender mustang- this amp does have a better clean tone and a slightly more natural punch, but it falls very short setting up channels and effects- the effects are not very good and the fact that if you select one of 3 pedal chains for the effects- that is the chain all of your saved sounds have to use.  I bought it with the foot controller- you can save 8 pre sets.. 2 banks of 4- but if you are on one channel and you want to be able take off an effect - you cannot switch to another channel without getting out of that effect mode- the mustang with the 2 pedal set up can go up and down your settings and also add/remove effects on the fly. again- if you aren't someone who needs to have a lot of different settings then this amp might be a good deal at 399$  you may be better off getting a few pedals to use- this amp is a good fit for pedals-
the one thing I did like on their software was the ability to select a premade tone from an upload and play it through the amp while connected to the computer without download.  I was very disappointed in the effects causing the horrible fuzz at the end of notes that most of these kinds of product do, and the noise gate included was as good as the one on the mustang.  I wanted to like this amp and be able to use it for gigs, but it did not offer what I needed.                
I was very frustrated in the begining, i couldn't get the amp to work with my Mac OS X, i needed to update the firmware before using it with tone studio, firmware update instructions were very confusing to say the least, after the update and tweaking on the screen for hours i got the amp to sound like anything i want, from easily best SRV sound i ever heard to Gary Moore Santana and even Metal stuff, also on high gain the amp is still becoming kinda fizzy, with headphones however the sound is less natural and a bit digital, but through the speaker the amp sounds very good, keep in mind you will need a lot of patience with this amp, it sounds pretty bad right out of the box, but once you get it hooked up to the tone studio, you can make it sound great.                
I Don't understand glowing reviews, must be Stockholm syndrome, yes it is inexpensive and gives you a lot on paper, but it sounds terrible, clean channel is good, everything else is just thin and brittle, every guitar sounds the same through this thing, every channel from crunch to brown is exactly the same but with added digital distortion the dynamics don't change at all, reverb is the worst i have heard since i started playing the guitar 25 years ago when i had digital zoom multi effects, brown channel however must be the worst one on this thing lol EVH would be laughing hard, 
i also run latest version of Sierra on my mac, and after downloading the driver and boss studio i have connected the amp only to be greeted by message that i must install updated software lol, well there isn't any i just installed it from roland's website, the amps is a joke and someone had to trash it, well let it be me. PS i also own Yamaha THR10x purchased from here as well, and it sounds magnificent with headphones or without, reverbs are insane and connectevity is a breeze, so there is digital technology that sounds as good as valves but in this amp, don't beleive paid you tubers and play one before you order it, i guarantee it will make your ears bleed.                
As with any new amp, there is usually sooo much hype in the beginning.  I wanted to wait until the honeymoon phase was over for the folks who had already bought one.  Well, I waited and the praise for this amp just kept on coming.  Right out of the box, this amp sounded HUGE.  As you have probably read on various forums, ~25 additional amps and numerous effects have already been unlocked within the firmware.  The Katana really cuts through the mix, and doesn't have the digital "artifacts" that plague other digital amps.  I'm just completely blown away.  Try a Katana, you have nothing to lose.  Roland certainly hit a home run with this one.......                
I did a lot of research before I purchased this amp. I could have got by with the one speaker, but I wanted two. I was going to say, "for the price" but  that is a injustice from where I sit. The tones and variations of tones is remarkable. The only other amp I would have bought is the Vox AC30, but the sound and price of this Boss was something I could not pass up.                
This amp is amazing!! It does home volume extremely well, while at the same time can literally drown out a drummer if you want to. You can only use three effects at a time, and one of those effects can only be reverb.. The effects are quite good with the weakest of the lot being the reverb.. The chorus is incredible and the booster distortion models are almost perfect!! The feel of this amp and the power section are the stars of the show!! I have done a few patch demos and other videos on my youtube channel... Check them out if you would like... Hubie H is the channel.
I was a bit skeptical but gave it a shot. Great tone out this amp for a solid state amp. Great for practice and playing in band setting. Iv done both and this thing is really loud and clear. Most solid state amps loose character when played at loud volumes. been playing for 25 years. Have played through probably every tube amp out there. I'm not saying this thing sounds exactly like a tube amp. It has the character of it though. Well worth the purchase. Iv had it for 2 months and there are so many tones i am still getting out of it. Give it a try Boss really out did themselves.                  
I have had many amps over the years, both solid-state & tube. This amp beats all solid-state amps I have owned. It is very responsive to your playing and the built-in effects are top notch. I can practice at a low wattage at home and not bother anybody or take to band practice and sound awesome at 50W...pedal friendly                
Just to be clear, I got the BOSS Katana-50 to use as a small, powerful, clean, full voiced amp platform for a modeling pedal (Fender Mustang Floor). For that purpose this amp would be tough to beat at any price, much less $199 IMHO. The on-board amp tones and effects are totally worthy, although I must say the all overdriven amp selections filter too much low end for my tastes. To be fair, it is sold as the Katana that will "Cut Through" as it says right on the factory carton. I use the "Clean" setting with the gain at about noon. It sounds great. BTW, I could totally use the amp as a grab and go. The on-board tones and effects are first rate. It's light, small, and loud in the right way. Recommended. P.S. I'm really hoping this amp proves to be as rugged and reliable as the other BOSS/Roland products I have owned and used. They have all been rock solid.                
I especially like the fact that it's easy to set up and play. No programming, just plug and play out of the box.  Depending on your style of music you should definitely take advantage of the software and update your presets.  the K50 now has the ability to store 4 presets (used to be only 2) via the software update.  I use a Boss FS-7 pedal to switch these 4.
Warning: this thing is LOUD. I really like the wattage feature to bring it down when playing at home.
My only complaint about the K50 is the lack of an FX loop.  I have a very old Dean Markley (oddly, named K50 as well) that has FX loop, line out, etc. Although the K50 takes pedals well, not having the FX loop limits the use of a looper pedal, which I often use. If you use any type of looper, you know what I mean. And again, using pedals only to layer effects over effects outside of the programmable ones via the software.  I have a few TC Electronic effects (Dark Matter, Dreamscape, Mini Comp) that I prefer over Boss.
Would still recommend the Katana as it sounds very good, especially after you've dialed in your tones and presets.  From what I've read, it gets better after the speaker breaks in.
Disclaimer:  the unit I received was making a crackling noise as if there was a loose instrument cable shorting out, poor grounding, or a 'confused' noise gate. I tried several guitars, cables, power outlets and it still had the noise. Mostly noticeable while not playing, just plugged in. I've returned it to Zzounds and a new unit is on its way.                
I recently received the  Katana 50 and shortly after sold my Bugera V22 and my Yamaha THR5. the ease of use of this amp is great, and it does sound great after you take your time to dial it in.  IMHO its much better sounding the Roland cube amp (excluding the blues cubes) the effects are good but they are Boss so if you dont like boss effects, you might want to try some pedals. I have not tried pedals in it but from my understanding, it takes them well. its a very light amp, Which makes it feel cheaper to me. and the only reason i knocked features down a little is that it would have been nice to have a tuner on it.   the facts that i can change the wattage is fantastic and it does sound good at lower volumes but i have noticed that it reacts as a tube amp would in that it sounds better turned up.  If you are a gigging musician go for the 100 watt i think it would be better for the clean channel to cut through the mix.
it sounds great and could very well replace your cheaper tube amps (bugera come to mind) but it certainly will not replace my mesa boogie express.                 
I bought this as a practice amp. I haven't used it outside of my house, but I have no doubt it could keep up with a drummer for band practice, a small gig, or a larger gig if mic'd up. 
All of the amp models sound great. I love the effects. I would be nice if there were more options for running the effects together however you want, but that's probably reserved for the 100 watt version. It took a few minutes to understand how the effects knobs worked, but it was fairly intuitive. The amps real potential opens up once you hook it up to your computer with the not-included OMNIHIL/usb cable. 
It would have been nice for Boss to include the footswitch instead of it being an optional extra purchase. It's not really needed if you're jamming at your house alone, but I would want one for a gig.
Overall, this thing rocks. I'd definitely recommend it. This solid state stuff has come so far compared to the old Peavey transtube stuff my friends and I had way back in high school.                 
This amp is great. It clear at all volumes and gets very close to the tube sound. Great tones and very loud. Also, the 5 different channels are great as well as the effects on the amp and being able to download from the Boss Studio. zZounds was great. 4 payment of $55 no credit check. Awesome. Nothing touches this amp for the price. Even more expensive ones aren't as good.                
I'll be really quick with this. It's a great amp,perfect for playing at home, I guarantee loud enough for a drummer.  I haven't gotten too far into the effects or computer stuff yet, but this is really split and play amp. Its not trying to sound like a jcm or a fender or a Mesa, it just sounds GREAT. I've owned plenty of other amps, orange, Marshall, Peavey tube amps, and this amp can compete for tone.
Bottom line is I WISH we had this sort of stuff when I was learning to play. Technology has come VERY far.                
Great amp. 50 watts with a 12" speaker,  amazing sounding onboard effects (Boss brand too!!). I can't turn the volume up past .5 (1/2) or else the neighbors complain. it has the power for gigs.  Clean channel is really crisp, bright and clear.  The overdrive channels are great also.  You can get basically any tone from this amp with the right twerking.  Definitely worth the money.                 
Boss Katana-50 is a nice little light weight practice amp that sounds decent enough. Got tired of dragging 40lb+ amps around for weekly practices. Also tired of putting my gigging amps through the wear and tear and daily practice grind. You have to play with it for awhile to dial in the sounds you need but this little 50w amp gets it done. I use mainly for practice at home and I have even used it at our regular weekly band practice and it will keep up and it will cut through the mix. It doesn't sound totally awesome but for the price and ease of use, it ain't too bad!                
I'll list the CONS first.- I think there's something wrong with the default software. When you turn the amp back on, it starts on different settings then what everythin' is turned to.There's free software on their website to connect a computer to. It's really a minor setback for the value of this amp.- The clean channel doesn't want to work with my Ibanez AS73, but the acoustic channel does the trick.-Remembering all your settings after if you tweak the other amp styles. This just takes a week or so to get used to.PROS:-Lots of varied sounds, especially because my guitar has 2 tone and 2 volume knob won the a 3 position switch.-Plenty loud for anyone wanting to get that feel of playing live, loud concerts.-Great price at $220.                
Between this technology and Quilter, there really are toneful options to Tube Amps. Some time and experimenting is needed to get things dialed in properly because the settings are very responsive and interactive. If this model had a true line out, it would be a perfect small venue amp. I have used it on large stages with a mic and it pushes a lot of air for its size. I never bring my heavy to e machines anymore to live gigs                
This is an addendum to my other review above. I have found "peace" with respect to taking advantage of the Katana Air's wireless capabilities. When used in the house, which is how I use it exclusively, I simply leave the amp itself plugged into the wall and fully charge the transmitter. I then plug it into my guitar of choice and leave it there. The light should glow green when plugged into ones guitar. When done using it, hang up your guitar and let the transmitter be. It will power down until you pick up the guitar again. I also press the Power Button on the amp until it is the only button illuminated. It glows orange and is the only button lit on the panel. If you've fresh batteries. you certainly can disconnect from the wall plug and go truly wireless......you give up 30 watt output for 20 watts when running on batteries and charge time for the transmitter becomes less predictable. All things considered, the Katana Air is a unique item, that once understood by its owner can be indeed liberating.                
I may be mis-reading the manual but I've yet to figure out how to keep the wireless transmitter charged. I'm not new at this having gotten Line 6's wireless transmitters when they first arrived on the scene. They were easy to use and worked as advertised. While I am a huge Roland/Boss fan, I'm thinking they may have missed the mark in the "ease of use" category on the Katana Air. From a sound perspective, the amp, when plugged into a wall socket sounds great; just what you'd expect from a Katana amp. And when the transmitter is fully charged, the same can be expected. The problem arises when trying to figure out how to keep it charged. When running the amp on batteries only, this seems this seems to be problematic in that the amp stops charging the transmitter when the batteries are low. The problem is you don't know the transmitter is dead until you try and use it.My most predictable approach is to plug in the amp with the provided DC cable and do my charging while the amp is "hard-wired" to the juice coming from a wall socket.Once the transmitter is fully charged, in this manner, I can disconnect the amp and run it on a fresh set of batteries. This will afford you a "temporary" wireless operation. The transmitter that I received didn't have any where's near the claimed lifespan. I'd be curious to see how other's experience with the Katana Air played out. I will keep fiddling with the KA and if I discover what it takes to make it truly wireless, I'll get back to you in a follow up review. Strangely I did keep this item, hoping for a downloadable software cure.There is a nice free ap that accompanies the KA.....It allows you to change all of the amp's audio settings and to download free patch sets. This works well with my iPhone 7+.                
I am very happy I got this amp. I haven't bought a new combo amp for a long time so I figured now was a good time seeing all the praise for this thing. When I first got it I thought it sounded good... a few nights of playing and it sounds awesome. The knobs are very sensitive and you can get a bunch of different tones with a lot of patient tweaking. The speaker also sounds great after a few days of consistent playing. So far my favorite rock/shred tone is the crunch with limited gain and the overdrive at the lowest setting. Very clear and fine attack with great tone. I have not used the delays, reverb and chorus to a great extent but they sound fine so far. Very easy to use and practical. I am also a classical guitarist and will try out my contact microphone through the acoustic channel at some point and a cheaper guitar with a built in mic. Great amp, great deal with the foot switch as well!                
I stoped gigging many years ago and got rid of all of my tube amps (marshall, fender, peavey, carvin).  The past years I have just been recording music at home and I run my guitar through my studio and processors which worked well for me. I decided that maybe it is time to buy a small amp for more depth.  I am a huge fan of boss effects and I heard alot of good things about the Katana series amps.  When the Katan Artist amp was announced I knew that I had to get one.  I am in no way disappointed at all with this amp.  I bought the big footswitch and the optional bank switch pedal and now I have an 8 channel amp.  This is a great.  The ToneStudio software is awesome too, I have been using it for a few years now with my other boss equipment.  This amp is loud, but I have to use it on the lowest power setting as I live in a condo and I don't want to piss off the neighbors, but everyonce and I while I'll crank it up and it sounds fantastic.  It loves my other pedals and sounds so clean.  A very good alternative to a tube amp.  Plus it's not that heavy either.                
One of the best solid-state amp deals on the planet. I use the Panel setting channel, the one that works like a regular knob-turning amp head delight, for my pedal board. I use the 4 channel footswitch, sold extra, to control the 4 pre-set channels. Except, BOSS upgraded the firmware for Katana head and it holds 8 pre-set channels,all accessed via footswitch. The software, Boss Tone Central, works flawlessly if you follow directions. Amazing control of genuine BOSS pedals inside this here amp! I use the on-board speaker for a practice amp but we  have a 1-10" cab, a 2-12" cab, and a 4-12" cab to use when needed. This amp rocks them all.                 
Hard to update, but man this thing sounds exactly the way I want to sound both recording and playing it through my 4x12 cab, I just plug it from my Rec Out to my Universal audio MKII Interface and thats it WOW such a Big rock sound and clean or Heavy WOW! I found my sound after buying a million Guitar plugins, Thanks Boss                
Your not going to find a better amp for the money.  I know it sounds cliche but it's the truth.  If your a fan of Boss pedals, you're in for a real treat.  They're built in!  There is software to tweak this.  There were Win10 issues but I believe they have been fixed.  And even with out the software, you can tweak various built in effects and save them and then recall the whole recipe with a push of a button.  I do that a lot!  I wish there were more storage buttons!  And for a solid state amp the tones are pretty amazing for all genres.                
This amp kicks azz. Watch some reviews on YouTube. Amazing range of tones and affects. I don't believe there is a tone this amp can't make, its that good. Love it. Thanks again for the great price and fast shipping zZounds!

I just purchased a Boss Katana head and I am very disappointed to find that Boss Tone Central is currently unavailable for windows.  Boss Tone Central is the primary interface for editing and programming effects with this amplifier and let me repeat myself on this: IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS COMPUTERS.
The amp DOES NOT COME WITH THE SOFTWARE.  The software is only available for download and is currently only available for IOS operating systems.
 How am I supposed to make the most of this amp when the most important part of the modeling interface is completely unavailable?
This key flaw makes the modeling aspect of this amp virtually useless.
I would also like to bring up another key flaw that makes this product less appealing compared to other amplifiers in this price range. This amp does not come with a footswitch. Even more troublesome for customers like myself, the Roland GA-FC (currently priced at $99 US dollars) is still on back order at every major music retailer. 
The lack of availability of a foot switch plus the extra cost of the footswitch itself makes this amp very undesirable in comparison to other amplifiers in this price range.
I am very tempted at this point to return this product.  Boss has really dropped the ball on this one.
I could have bought a Fender Mustang V for $50 less and none of this would be an issue.  All of the Fender Mustangs effects and modeling/editing features are built right into the amp.  Not only does the Fender Mustang come with a footswitch, it even comes with a built in tuner.  Needless to say, the Boss Katana does not even have that simple feature.  
The Boss Katana Head is neither a symbol of honor or precision as their slogan reads, but rather the epitome of complete incompetence from the Boss/Roland corporation.
Take my advice, either get a Fender Mustang V or a Line 6 Spider IV because this amp is trash.                
Simply put, Boss' new Katana Mini has assumed top of the hill status when considering a small, light weight amp that has an assortment of convincing tones and effects and can run on batteries alone. The previous fly weight contender, the 5 watt Black Star Fly, will now be relegated to the bargain table. Boss added two watts, extra voices and managed to maintain its fly (feather) weight status. For a small inexpensive practice amp, it will be tough to beat the Katana Mini. In fact at the moment consider this new Boss offering to be the King of the Hill in the Fly weight class. And yes, you can purchase an AC adapter if batteries don't do it for you. Hats off to Boss. They get it!!                
I own the Katana head and I love it. Run that bad boy through a vintage Marshall 4x12 and its magical, however sometimes I want to sit and watch a movie while shredding and this is was my solution. Shred at the office. Shred at the beach. Shred in space. No limits! 
The sound quality is wonderful and this little champion pumps out some serious volume. The clean channel sparkles while the crunch channel sounds so frickin AC/DC its not even funny. It responds well to your playing for actual musical dynamics. The Brown channel is great and does what it should but I loooove the crunch on this mini better. Metal heads will not be disappointed though, it gets the job done for practice purposes without ruining inspiration like the horrible Line 6 things. 
The delay on the amp is simple and great. I wish they would have squeezed reverb in as well but we have pedals for that if necessary. 
Once again BOSS does it again for a price so low its practically free.                
Clean crunch and brown you can get a good tone out of all 3. Delay is ok. Turn down the time and crank the level and u got reverb kind of. I have the Blackstar fly 3 and its dam good for the money. Imho the katana surpasses the fly 3. This box rawks. I played it for 3 hours when i got it. Tried it with Duncan JB/59 then EMG retro active humbuckers and active single coils. Then my deluxe Roadhouse strat. Then Dimarzio in my vintage Talon II... There's a reason people are talking about the Katana. I could tell you but if you buy one you will know why immediately. Get it from zZounds and your good to go. Got mine in 1 day and no shipping charge. Thanx zZounds. The Katana mini put a smile on my face. Almost as good as sex lol err um not really but it will make u wanna play. Get one now.                
I have been using this for a few weeks now and I love it's flexibility. I have used it as both a standard A/B/Bypass switch and as basically an on board mixer. As a pedal board mixer, it basically works like a Blender. I dial line A in at about -25% and keep line B (my main effects line) at 12'o clock and i can mix in my ambient effects without drowning out my main sound. This is a great feature for me...The flaw? It doesn't have a "Y" setting in the A/B loop. So I cannot go from A to B to A&B combined. If I want to use A&B combined (like the Blender example above), it only goes between A&B and Bypass.                
I had a problem w/ my BD 2 amping up so much louder than my other pedals that my volume pedal was useless.  I tried turning down volume on my GE 7 but that affected the tone.
I tried out this unit, ran it thru A channel and my MM 4 looped thru B and everything else straight thru.
The result is a balanced sound and I didn't lose that wonderful BD2 tone!!                
I like the ability to switch between 2 channels and simultaneously use other pedals w/ each channel.  I like the separate volume controls.  It's a dream and I'm getting one!                
It's Boss, built like a tank and built quality.  What else can you say?                
It's on sale now for around $80.  Great deal. 
I'm not real sure about other brands.  I'm a BOSS man mostly.                
Yes.  I called Boss because of my volume problems.  After talking to the tech he recommended this unit.  Guess what?  He was dead on RIGHT!  
I like that :D                
sex appeal?  Get real!  But I really do want it!                
I don't anticipate replacing it.  If I did my wife would kill me LOL                
Does exactly what it's suppose to and  has that Boss durability.                
When your ready to admit your a pure pedal addict, this is the "no-noise", "no-click" solution !....lets you keep yourGATE SETTINGS at every volume!!!!!!BUY THIS  the get George L's.... and wire two channels without fear off noise or loose !!!!                
I really don't have anything else to compare the sound to, but, I really like the quality switching of the LS-2.                
This pedal does exactly what I wanted it to do, switch two acoustic guitars with pickups on and off and allow me to set the level of each.  We now have two LS-2 in series for switching three guitars on and off.  I call the LS-2 my floor mini-mixer.                
Piece of cake to setup and use.  With two LS-2s we can switch three or four guitars on and off quickly.                
Is this product made well?  It's a Boss pedal, it really is built to last.                
We all want things to be cheaper these days, I think this pedal is a pretty good value.  A simple switch may have worked in our application, but the features of this pedal made the cost worth it for me.                
A pedal is a pedal is a pedal to me.  It works and it works well, that's what I am really interested in.                
I expect this pedal will be used for a LONG time.  I can't imagine playing without it.  I do wish it had a mode for passing the A+B inputs to either the A, B or OUT outputs, but I have easily learned to work around that.  It would be a great feature though.                
I really don't think I could undersell you on this pedal. For the price of one high end "boutique" modulation pedal you get a vast array of modulation tones ranging from the must haves to the ones you never knew you wanted until you hear them on the MD 500. All of the presets sound incredible and give you an excellent idea of what this pedal is capable of, the only effects I've been underwhelmed by are the Univibe and Rotary effects, to my ears those two are far from faithful to the originals and sound quite bad. The chorus, flanger, phaser and octave are all top notch and could easily take down many of their analog counterparts. I mean the sound is so pristine it's almost 3D. I've only just begun to edit my own patches but so far I have indeed been able to dial in perfect versions of each effect for basically any situation you can think of, the versatility of this thing is nearly endless. You can recreate damn near any chorus etc tone you can think of and edit parameters not found outside a studio usually. I know I'm rambling so I'll just close out the review by stating that I could easily see this being the last modulation pedal I'll ever need. I prefer analog delay hands down, so I didn't bond with the DD 500, my reverb needs are limited to spring (which I have), but for modulation effects like chorus, I may just prefer digital now. Never thought I'd say that, but it's true (with this pedal).                
As soon as I plugged in the pedal, the first words out of my mouth were... "damn". This thing is nice! It gives you alot of tone, that was somthing that I wasn't expecting when I got it. The pedal is built nice. The volume/effects pedal itself has a nice feel to it, lots of control nice up and down movement. The tuner is great.                
Compressor/Limiter - Lots of control. These are nice but some of them you can't tell the differnce between them.
Distortion/Synth - The Distortions are good, snyth's are kinda lame... but I don't play techno so who cares?
Delay/Modulation - The Delay is kick ass I fun messing with that. Flange is good, Phaser is great, Chorus and Delay = My favorite effect.
Filter/Tone - The Tone pedals defretter, wha, and enhancer are great also. Wha effects on the expresion pedal are nice, the octaves are not worthy to a digitech whammy pedal but close.
Expresion Pedal - The Wah pedal is good, Resonance can give you some really wierd sounds, the Octaves on the expression pedal are great to mess with, soundhold is a good pratice tool, and the Kick drum effect is by far one of the coolest things to use to practice or rub in your drummers face.                
Built great.                
This is worth every penny. I love this pedal!                
Good support just go to there site and you find any information you need.                
Everyone that I have shown it too has had nothing but good things to say, after they caught there breath again.                
I'll be satisfied for a long time I do believe                
It's a great gizmo for bass players of all abilities. easy to use and very versatile. I have been gigging with it for about a year now and I think it's worth every penny!                
I was surprised at how good this pedal sounds.... It has all the useful effects that a bassist would need.... The thing is built like a tank... I highly recommend it to anyone who is tired of having to handle a ton of pedals and cords...                
I just got this a few days ago but, I've been playing with it non stop. This thing is great. I'm running it from the output into a Red Box classic on the 1x12 setting and, then to the board for late night headphone jamming and recording. It's awesome for this. Way better then amp sims. The filter section isn't of much use to me and the delay modulation I pretty much use just a small touch of chorus otherwise the rest is wasted on me. The volume/wah pedal mean nothing to me either I don't use them. The distortions are great, those I do use. They give you bass specific distortions without sucking the low end out of my tone. The eq and compressor sections are worth the price of admission alone. Smooth useable bass tones from this section. The compressor section is amazing. Bass compression with multiple flavors that all work as advertised. The noise suppressor dial on the back of the unit is also very worth mentioning although almost nobody does. It's very effective and quiets my little Mustang bass right up. I'm getting awesome tone straight to the board and into my DAW using the combo of this unit and the Red Box. I highly recommend this combo to anybody trying to work late at night without waking up the neighbors. I expect this unit to last a very long time as with all my Boss products. I'm still using a couple of Boss half rack effects from the 80's in my vocal rig. Still got Boss pedals from that era in the line up as well. Never actually owned a Boss product that quit working for anything other then user error. Like when my ex threw my chorus pedal in the lake.                 
This unit sounds amazing.  I bought it mostly for its distortions, but using other effects in combonation with distortion can get you some very harsh tones, and some more usable ones.  I think you could use this with any kind of music.  I dont think I will ever need another pedal.                  
The big feature on the ME-50B is dedicated knobs for each effects section.  This makes things very easy to understand, especially if you are working with 2 or more effects.  I am still a little sore that boss pedals just dont come with the AC adapter.  Everybody buys one.                
This pedal is invincible.  All the knobs are tough, and so is the expression pedal.  Its perfect for on stage use.                
For all the effects jammed into here, this is the best value you will find.                
Its got so much cool stuff that you just have to have it. I probably wont ever find any usable effects out of half the stuff... but i still love messing around with it.                
This products is amazing.  If you buy it you will not be dissapointed.  This is the perfect toneshaping device, and it dosent have all that amp/cab stuff that you wont use anyway to jack up the price tag.                
I've owned a couple of fx boxes but this one is pretty sweet.  Just the right amount of effects and a built in expression pedal.  Good times.                
Expression pedal, built in 4 band eq w/ master level, lots of compression options, noise suppressor, easy interface, quick editing at your fingertips, and tons of effects.  Yeah this thing is freakin sick.  There is so much noise you can generate that it's silly.  SILLY!                  
Heavy.  Metal.  Blue.  This thing is meant to be stepped on, remember?                
You bet.  If $300 is burning a hole in your wallet then get this thing.  You'll be glad you did.                
No problems at all - but if this thing is truly boss then I don't see one anytime soon.                
Oooooh yeah ... get some!                
If you have some dough laying around then do yourself a favor and get it.  Trust me, you'll poop when you get your hands on it.  I doubt I'm going to need to get anything to replace this.                
Awesome distortions and phaser/flanger sounds. Love the expression pedal. I like the t-wah for funky stuff. Defretter is great!                
i really like the knob-based design of this unit. I can dial up any sound I want in a minute or two. The unit should come with a power supply instead of batteries. everyone is going to buy the wall-wart anyway.                
Really easy to dial up any sound and write it to a bank. One read through the manual had me going quickly.                
The usual Boss quality. Made for stage use.                
If you're looking for an easy to use multi effects unit, this one is it! You get great sounds by turning the knobs and you don't need to be a software wiz to use it.                
Haven't needed it yet, but I would expect nothing less from Boss.                
Put it this way: I went in looking for a bass POD XT LIVE, and left with this one.                 
I don't expect to buy another multi-effects unit. Ever. This is it.                
Has everything you will need. You can program it to your specs. Good quality. Has expression pedal. Get the power supply, batteries ware out quickly.                
Too bad it's all digital but they did a good job concidering that. Only the synth part is really dodgy, you need to change all settings to get that sounding good. But it's usable wheter you play funk, jazz, rock or pop. I'm not too sure about metal, since it hasn't got any really dark things, but I don't play metal anyway so f^$& that.                 
All made of metal so it's a tank, the usual boss quality. Very useful is the expression pedal, compression and the tuner is also very welcome. It hasn't got amp modeling, but the effects have been given better attention to. 
If you have a 2 option footswitch use it, instead of buying 2 FU-5's. My amp switch works on it.                 
Tank built. No more to say.                 
A bit expensive, but when you've bought it, really worth it's price.                 
Never had to deal with them ,but for what I've heard boss has a good customer service                
It looks really attractive, since it's only turning knobs, and little menu's to scroll through. When you've bought the footswitches it's even easier. The colour is dark blue, lighter than the guitar version. Looks good                
Just another great pedal by boss, especially when you don't want to buy all analog pedals. This covers most needs.                 
I haven't used many bass effects pedals, so can't say "the best", but of the ones I've used, and after messing with various guitar effcts with bass, I have to say I'm very satisfied.                
Again, haven't used them all, so can't say "best", but it's got more than I'll ever use. Compression is great, distortions are smooth and obviously tailored to bass. Chorus, delay, flange and phaser sound good. Wah lacks character (I'm not even sure what I mean by that), but for my rare use is adequate.                
Very easy to set up. That's why I wanted knobs instead of menus. Plays well with others (I use it to record into a DAW. Beats the devil out of the available amp sims such as SVX and Guitar Rig). There's always a learning curve, but all ya gotta do is lean down and turn a knob, not memorize a freakin' computer interface!                
Have used Boss products forever. Built like a tank, never had a problem (I also have a ME70 that I've had for a while).                
Yes, though it could've come with an ac adapter.                
The best support is the one you never need.                
This is a "toy". I don't need it to make good music (been playing over 40 years). It adds "color" and is fun to play with, make freaky noises and such. I Like it! That said, I probably wouldn't have bought it if it was pink, yellow or green. The dark blue color is perfect.                
Can't imagine needing anything else for bass, but you never know. If it disappeared I'd replace it in a minute.                
Having owned 2 Boss floor processors (GT-3, GT-8) I must say I could not be more unhappy with this garbage. If Zzounds offered any other bass floor processor with more than a couple effects and an expression pedal, I'd have sent it back and got something different. It reminds me of one of the cheaper junk guitar processors in the $150 range, really stripped down on the functionality. As it was, I was stuck needing something quick, so yeah... zZounds, you do a great job otherwise; please offer a bass multi fx unit that isn't either minimal fx choices with good quality, or a bunch of crap jammed in a box like I grossly overpaid for. If you do, I'll buy it.                
Got sounds that you would expect from a boss pedal.  A lot of great sounds, and some that are not needed.                
Great features.  Solid EQ, solid sound.  Expression pedal is excellent!! Just doesnt come with a power adapter.                
The knobs and controls are so easy.  No need for a manual (but read it anyway).                
Tough boss construction.  The expression pedal could have better feel though.                
$300 is a lot, but well worth it.                
Havent needed any.                
Super hot sounding and hot looking.  Can you ask for more.                
EQ, Compresser, Chorus/Delays, Octaver and Tube Drive emulation very good sounding.  Less impressive are the synth sounds.                  
Tuner and Volume/Expression pedal are handy.  It would be nice if it didn't use a "wall wart", as the thin cord could be damaged onstage.  Also would have been nice to include a transport case.
This unit doesn't include the amp modeling features popular in many units on the market these days.  That's fine with me, as I don't find amp/speaker modeling useful for my needs.                
Solid Boss construction we've come to expect.                  
Never had a problem with a Boss product, so who knows?                
I've been checking out Bass Multi-Effects units and Preamps with built-in effects for a few years now.  Either they felt like cheap plastic, or the preamp sections sounded lousy, or the thing would be a nightmare of buried menus.  
The Boss ME-50B was impressive enough to take home on trial, then purchase later the same day.                
I'll be surprised if this unit isn't embraced by bassists in various styles of
music.  I don't think that amp modeling is a priority for most bassists, and by leaving out that feature, Boss has created a smaller, simpler multi-effects unit.                
Plug a set of ear buds into the headphone jack and leave them on the floor. plug left/mono out to your clean channel amp set straight up. Let the ME80 do all the work.   This is how i play live with it and it sounds great using the preamp section instead of my cabs gains/effects/lead channel.  Works for me.                
Love the tuner, the whammy, the terra echo, the presets actually sound good too.  I go to some of them as is.                 
Very easy for experienced pedal users.  I could see it being overwhelming for a beginner.  Watch videos, all of them.                  
Very sturdy, it is an electronic and nothing is certain with electronics. Until it dies im going to play it and not worry about that.                 
Worth every penny.  I bought a Digitech Whammy a few years ago for $150. This has that and like 60 other effects, tuner, its endless.  The terra echo, delays, univibe, reverse, compressors, wah, its crazy how worth it it is.                  
No need for support, yet. Im sure I wont need it.                 
Ive pretty much said it all.  It has everything i need. I love it.                 
The ME 80 is amazing (for me).  Very easy to use(for me).  Ive been playing for 20 years and have owned various amps, pedals, guitars etc and this is by far the most fun ive had playing in 20 years.  It has everything I could ask for. I personally like the distortions, they sound great.  My band mates love the sounds its throwing.   The batteries have lasted me 7-8 hours of playing so far and the 'low battery' light still has yet to come on.  Built in tuner is really nice and the whole product is very hiss and buzz free.   It is actually helping me be a better and more artistic player.                  
This box has it all and I am very satisfied with the sounds, and may I add so many sounds that I'll never use them all, that this pedal has. Great Great  Great. Thanks for making this item to use at the touch of a button. Great for the Money.......                
This pedal will not let you down, you get every sound you can dream of. I really like the overtone setting. It's built very rugged, it'll withstand what you throw at it. And with Boss tone central, you can dial in a variety of tones, I'm very satisfied with my purchase!                
I had originally ordered the me-70 but it was put on back order. I was interested in the boss tera echo pedal and saw the me-80 had it as an integrated effect. I am very pleased with the pedal. Its very heavy duty, and adjusting the effects is super easy. I wanted this type of pedal because twisting knobs is just handier than going through buttons. The integrated tuner is also nice to have. Sound wise the options are incredible. I really enjoy the Bogner high gain cab model using the Tera echo and a second delay. A wall of crunchy waves of sound. Some effects I'll never use. But its nice to have them in your arsenal should you get the itch. Overall a good solid pedal. The usual great boss tones. All in one large package.                
Granted, this isn't a RP100 or some $500+ effects system, but for the price this thing is great. Not terribly complicated and the ease of changing things on the fly with the bevy of knobs is frickin sweet. No scrolling through menus and not knowing exactly what you're changing is fabulous. It emulates a large selection of Boss pedals very convincingly and as I said before... you can't beat the price.                
This is a rock solid effects unit. I chose the ME-80 over the BOSS GT-100 to avoid having to navigate sub menus within the LCD displays. It's a personal preference for me to dial in sounds with knobs rather than shape sounds through digital drop down menus and generic parameters pictures offered with LCD screens. Now, I am an analogue guy when it comes to superb sonic quality/character when using dynamics/time based effects. As most pedal junkies know, an analogue pedal board gets pretty crazy over time and you have to ask,"is this a realistic set up for my purposes?" Well, for me it made more sense to have a consolidated palet of very good quality BOSS effects rather than expand my simple 2 pedal analogue effects chain. I loved my analogue delay and analogue envelope phaser set up, but how often can you use a pristine sounding analogue envelope filter? . It's one of those effects that in my opinion should be used in moderation. On the subject of envelope filters, the ME-80 has this feature labeled as up wah in the compressor section of the effects unit. Yes, it's much more difficult to dial in the sensitivity and response with the BOSS up wah/envelope filter but this is where the BOSS tone central came in to the rescue. Bottom line, you definitely get what you pay for and much, much more with the ME-80. Take the almost limitless possibilities offered on board the ME-80 and add the BOSS tone central feature and you are covered from every angle in the effects department. The BOSS tone central has an enormous amount of sonically insane effects that are also very practical in use. We all know some multi effects units have sounds that really have little place for use within the framework of constructed songs or compositions but may be used in some sort of ambient,sound scape piece. Last feed back for the ME-80 is volume levels between different effects.I read a number of similar reviews about how this unit is troublesome with volume levels from one effect to the other. I took time to focus on this issue and here's what I figured out about the volume issues: Gain strucutre in a common term used in recording studios. So, since this unit has a manual mode, user preset mode and factory preset mode I started working out the volume issue. First off, the consistency between user presets ( imported from BOSS tone central) and factory presets were very consistent. Nowever, in manual mode volume levels were all over the place. I isolated this problem to the pre amp section of the ME-80 when setting gain structure in manual mode. Here's how I approached setting proper gain structure: first, engage the pre amp section in manual mode and keep this setting the same as a reference point. Now, from here you can walk through each individual pedal one at a time. When you engage another pedal while your chosen pre amp setting is on and set, use either the gain knob, output knob or fx level knob to increase volume for that pedal section or decrease the volume for that pedal section. When setting your manual mode gain strucutre it's best to toggle between manual mode and one of your other modes, preset or user preset mode. Compare the volume levels and match manual mode as best as possible. Repeat this process for all pedal sections in manual mode. NOTE** your EQ pedal in manual mode will throw off the gain structure every time. So, the solution is to set the output level counter clock wise to no output gain. This allows your EQ settings to be applied to any combination of manual mode effects while retaining that gain structure. Lastly, any changes made to your manual mode effects settings may require a little more/less volumes in certain sections. Mostly in the dynamics based sections like pre amp, eq, compressor. The time based effect setting shouldn't be affected too much. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps.                
Ordered and delivered in fewer than 24 hours. Yet another plus for zZounds. So, I've read the reviews about the high gain drives sounding digital, and, well, since this IS a digital processor..... I'm not a high gain player, so that doesn't bother me. The overdrives (od-1, Tubescreamer, blues driver) sound great for me. My Bugera V22 brings this unit to life. Great match. I love my amp's natural overdrive,  but I was wanting more control over the levels on stage, so I thought I was going to need pedals. I've always loved Boss products, so I wanted to go that route, but a pedal board gets rather messy, and this multi effects unit cures those ills. This negates the need to purchase so many pedals. The modulation effects are stellar with this unit. The tuner is great, too. The expression pedal is a dream come true for me as well. I believe the sound is great through an amp and headphones. I can't wait to run it through the PA system at my church. The build quality is great as the casing is metal. The footswitches could give one a bit of concern, but I'm not heavy-footed.                 
I have owned several processors but fing scrolling through menus frustrating and slow. I hesitated to buy this device because although it seemed like it would be easier to use, i was concerned about limited functionality. Not a problem! I can create any tone i have needed quickly and easily. Very intiative. Great product!                
An amazing but complicated box. The only way to learn to operate this system is hands on training. once you get by that it becomes an easy tool to use and the effects are awesome with good sound and an amazing effects. I am satisfied in this item.                
I bought this here through zZounds with their magnificent Play As You Pay plan. The unit came in pretty quick and packaged extremely well. I plugged it up and starting jamming with it. The effects are pretty solid but the distortion is very thin and crackly. It would work if you play low distortion blues or rock but for metal it just did not cut it for me. in short, if you like wild effects and sparkly cleans this unit if for you, but if you like a modern metal tone i would go somewhere else.                
This is my first real effect pedal, so I don't know much, but what I do know is it's perfect for writing music. I can play anything from jazzy tunes to high gain metal. I wouldn't recommend it in a live setting unless you really get to understand it and set it up perfectly. I've owned it for a month and I'm still adjusting knobs trying to get the right sound, but that's because I'm a perfectionist. I love it though, it's better than any other multi effect pedal I've played with. It's easy to setup and get going right away. No digital menus to go through, so it's straight forward. All of the effects are pretty good, but some are a bit digital, but that's okay.                 
I really like the sound, tone and feel of this mufti-effects pedal. Manual mode allows pedal board style operation. The amp models are quite good. There are also many professional presets for download at Boss Tone Central.                 
I really like this pedal. i ultimately preferred the GT-100 because of the stereo options. That is the only reason. I think the octave effects are better on the me-80!                
Great effect!s My only issue with the ME-80 is the Overdrive/Distortion section which I use 80% of the time and Being with two different bands I can chose which Overdrive/Distortion I want.  But it was still too sterile sounding for me,maybe I'll wait a couple of years for the next revision. Other than that, its easy to use,easy to program,awesome effects,great Boss quality.  If you don't mind a slightly sterile Overdrive/Distortion then get it!  its a great deal! But as for me,I'll just wait a couple more years till Boss gets the OD/DS section figured out and I'm sure they will.  They have great Engineers and great minds that work over there.....                
The pedal is pretty awesome. Has a variety of uses. Only thing I feel that really pokes out to me, sound wise, is that the effects have a digital edge and I still get some noise in my fx loop even with the noise active and my ISP Decimator G STRING in the chain. The Terra echo is great and the ability to loop your riffs is awesome, definitely comes in handy. 
Wish there was better EQ on it but it's not too bad. Still that digital edgy sound if you're not careful.  
As for quality it's built great. All metal pretty much with some weight.                
I just recently sold my GT-100 because the sound was too thin (digital) and there were many digital artifacts when controlling effects parameters (stepping can be heard in every single instance when changing values via a controller) - I was hoping BOSS might have corrected some of these with the ME-80 - unfortunately, they haven't - it's very strange, but it seems the company has taken a "lowest denominator" approach to their new products - as though they figure most people won't be able to identify those issues.I was so disappointed in the sound and features (lack thereof) that I actually asked Zzounds for an RMA#, the very next day! Then, I had an idea: I connected my analog pedals to it for taking care of compression and ovedrive/distortion, and only use the ME-80 for other effects - that improved the sound and, even though I will have to carry some extra pedals, it's still easier than carrying my huge pedal boards for smaller gigs and/or rehearsal - so, I decided to keep it. Here are some things that BOSS could have done better, imo:1) have a switch for the speaker emulation as opposed to force you to plug something in, which is sure to cause problems in the long run. How expensive can a simple switch be?2) offer a few more effects, such as the SLICER, etc... and have more options for where those effects are located on the pedal board (which switch turns them on/off) as it is, I feel short changed for the amount of money the unit costs. Right now, the compression takes up the same slot as other effect and that is a waste. There should be a full-time compression "module" that can be switch on/off3) the AMP modelling is pretty weak - I don't even care if they actually emulate ANY amps, I just would like it to say good - this sounds very thing and digital - the DRIVE amp can be worked with and with the addition of an analog compressor it's workable3) again, the EQ section (not the the one in the AMP) should have its own, full time slot - instead, it now shares with other effects, such a Delay, CHR, etc..4) if you record a loop and then want to switch memory location (i.e. switch to a different patch), the loop is immediately erased - I don't know if this can be changed in the system options but, I don't recall seeing such a note in the manual.5) Why no effects loop? Really, at this price, there should be one.On the positive side the unit is a pleasure to use! Very easy and very intuitive - I hope they use this system on the next GT-100MKII or whatever they will call it - the knobs are just the ONLY way to go when creating patches! No more scrolling through screens/pages, etc... My wish list for the new replacement of the GT-100 is:1) an ANALOG section for COMPRESSION and DRIVE sounds2) An interface that uses the KNOBS for each section (as in the ME-80) 3) the new DOUBLE foot switches - those things rock!4) the MEMORY/MANUAL switch as in the ME-80 (please, no more having to press 2 switches at once, please!I used it at a gig last night, running stereo with a Boogie DC-3 and a TECH 21 PWR 60 cab and it sounded very good! It will NOT sound that good directly through a PA, even with the speaker emulation turned on, so be aware of that.All in all, it will make my life a bit easier and with a little ingenuity can be made to sound very good for most types of music. But, there will be compromises and some shortcomings to accept.                
Theres already plenty of reviews about this pedal but it does live up to its name. I love the distortion it delivers. I use a Marshall amp and a Gibson studio electric, put all three together it rocks!! I love it!                
I have had this about a month and am still working my way through all the possible combinations I can get out of it. It has good sound, good adjustments, easy to use, so far I love it!                 
I use a Washburnx37 seven string guitar with seymore duncan JB pickups and a Washburn 7 string with Dimarzio X2N pickups in the bridge.I drop way down to A and G tunings.With thick .70 strings.I use an old Ibanez Toneblaster 100 watt head for the clean channel and a presonus mic tube preamp to make the signal louder.With an Ibanez toneblaster 4x12 cab.Anyways This new boss metalcore pedal is crunchy and powerful at  the same time without being muddy or tinny.I like it alot better than the deathmetal pedal and the Metalzone.It also will make your sound more punchy.My band plays heavy,fast death and blackmetal and this pedal makes my sound cut through the mix with ease.I say to anyone with a cheap amp with crappy distortion to buy this pedal and run it into your clean channel for an awesome distortion tone.I would also buy a cheap 50.00$ tube preamp like a behringer or art ,just to boost your  guitar signal before it hits the amp.Makes it twice as loud!                
This pedal does not have  alot of features.It has a high,low,level and distortion adjustment.But its tuned for a heavy low mid crunchy sound.If you turn down the distortion and turn up the high then you will get a more midrange 80s metal lead sound.I like the highs down and lows up for a thick badass modern metal tone.Even if your guitar has cheap stock pickups,this thing will make um sound great.So go out and get a job and go buy this pedal.lol.                
easy                
Never had to contact Boss.                
BY far the best overall sound for METALHEADS. after some careful decision making between this and 2 other pedals (one by line 6 and other by Digitech) i am more than happy with the sound. I use this with a stock LTD f50 and a crate GTX212 120 watt and the range of sound is incredible. Metal to black metal and death metal and everything in between!                
i jumped on the free Ac adapter offer!!!                 
EASY EASY EASY is all i have to say. after playing around with teh settings, i found my favorite sound in just a few minutes                
It seems tough. time will tell.                 
Definitely worth the price in its range.                 
could be bigger.. haha but its sexy.                 
Myself,I play a Fender 60's Classic Strat, I've tried alot of Boss' Pedals, Each one gives at lest some unique sound of it's own, But as far as the ML-2 Metal Core goes, I commonly dial In low in the pedal and low in the amp to get that really deep sound.. It doesnt fuzz out, It's a nice smooth tone, It even does beautiful work with my Fender Frontman 15B amp.. to anyone who wants an Industrial or Hardcore metal sound.. Its A MUST!!                
I have no complaints what so ever, Really I'm happy that they didnt produce it in Digital, I prefer the classic analog.. Though I kinda wish It had memory settings of a Digital, Cause I find a good setting.. and I forget exactly what it was when I try to go back to it.                
It's almost too easy!                 
Well, It comes with a five year warranty from Boss, I've literally abused it.. stomped into it during a good fun riff, I've accidently kicked it in the middle of the night, forgetting I left it in the floor, even when I put a new battery in it today, It slipped out of my hand and I dropped it.. didnt affect it even in the least bit.  It's awesome!                
Im really happy with it, It's worth whatever price tags anyone puts on em , probably even more.                
I love the way it looks, an original design.. I love the black and silver-flake paint scheme, looks great and adds a certain finesse to my  three-tone sunburst Fender Strat and my jet-black with silver-screening Fender amps..                
Only way I'll look for another distortion pedal, if Boss builts another ML series with added features, or maybe combine It with a reverb pedal?.. Either way I'll always enjoy the ML-2.                
I have to say, I was sceptical and excited about this pedal. I own the MT-2 and have for a couple years, I have also tried numerous other pedals.  This one, out of the box, kicks ass.  Easy to manipulate tone (unlike the nasaly MT-2), serious bottom end and screaming highs.  I have fallen in love with a pedal again!  It was a long time coming, but it's definately worth the wait!  Get one and try it out, if you don't like it return it, but I doubt you will!                
This is the heaviest pedal ever made!  I have the Metal Zone and I like it, but if you play it side by side with the Metal Core, it will sound weak and watery.  The Core has the deep down and dirty tone that makes for serious edgy metal.  It is DEEP!  It will give that heavy tone that you really need if you drop tune.  If you don't drop, you will sound like you do.  It's that heavy.  Buy one.  Buy three.  It's that good.                
You can contour the tone very well.  You can give it lots of highs, or dial 'em back and just go for heavy rhythm chunk.  And let me tell you, it will give you CHUNK!                
Very easy standard controls, just like any other Boss or any other pedal, but with tone for days.                
Like all Boss, it is built like a tank, very road-worthy.  I have more than a dozen Boss pedals and in 4 years I have never had a Boss pedal break.                
The best tone you will get from any pedal.  Forget the price.  It will replace a few pedals on your board.  In fact, you may want this as the ONLY pedal on your board.                
Boss rules, simple as that.                
Nice color.  Cool metal gray.                
I said "Buy it!" and I meant it! Now quit screwing around and go get one!  Are you still reading this...                   
Well I must say I am disappointed in this pedals sound. Very grainy and sctratchy with lots or high gain. Does not do good lows with drop tuning.                
First let me say I bought this pedal looking for a good Metal Distortion pedal. I play a mixture of Death Metal, Grindcore and Speed Metal and I was looking for a pedal that would compliment my styles. I had heard a lot of great things about this pedal from many people so I went out on a limb and bought it. Unfortunately for me, that limb couldn't hold my weight. Or at least not the weight of my sound demands. I gave it a ten on features because It's got good features. But the sound and texture doesn't change much.                
Ease of use it pretty straight forward. I mean you'd have to be a complete idiot not to know how to use it. There is one problem though is that you really have to screw with the knobs if you want to lower your gain at all. It really throws off the EQ.                
It's made well.                  
it's hard to decide. It's a fair price for a pedal like it but not for the sound that comes from it. I'd pay more for a crap complementary pedal than this, but thats because I hate the sound. All in all if you like it sure. If you don't then no value sucks.                
It's a pedal... It doesn't even sound sexy                
I would recommend not getting this pedal if you are a fan of modern heavy metal. If you must then fine, but I would strongly encourage getting the Digitech Metal Master of Boss MT-2 Metal Zone.                
I like the sound of this pedal. Turn up the lows for a heavy, dirty sound perfect for nu metal, death metal, and the like. Crank up the highs, and youll get a nice ,trebly scream oh so useful for those nice 80s leads. But comparing it to the MT-2 is pretty stupid (Sorry if younr sick of the MT-2 comparisons). I think that the MT-2 is the best distortion stompbox ever, and maybe a top five stompbox ever, period. So dont even try to compare them.                
This is probably the low point for this pedal. Its about average in features comparing to other stompboxes, maybe a little below that. There are four knobs: Low, High, Level, Gain. But the Mid knob is missing, which is HUGE, because that means NO SCOOPING and NO MID-BOOSTED SOLO SOUNDS! And compared to the MT-2, its just shameful.                
As I said earlier, there is kind of a lack of features on this pedal. But that makes up here. Its REALLY easy to use. For the idiot, heres how: you turn the knobs until you get the sound you want, then you just play. Easy, huh? Its easier to use than the MT-2, but I know how to operate stompboxes, so this isnt an issue.                 
Its a Boss. Enough said.                
Its $99.00 for this thing, when you can get the MT-2 for the same price. Take your pick.                
I dont know, so Ill give it a neutral rating.                
Ill hand it to Boss here: they made a NICE looker here. The black and silver is DEFINATELY good for heavy metal. Not the best looking stomper ever, but one of the best-looking stomper Boss makes.                
Its a pretty good pedal. its got a nice lowdown, dirty sound for modern metal. But really, if you want this pedal THAT bad, do yourself favor and get the best distortion stomper ever in the MT-2 Metal Zone. Trust me, you wont regret it.                
The sound is AMAZING!! It's more distortion then you'll probably ever need. I would recommend this pedal to anyone that plays rock, thrash or metal etc. I've found the sound I craved for.                
Just your simple level,low, high and distortion knobs. The sparkles all over the pedal make it look outstanding!                
Simple to operate. Manual is also very clear about it.                
This pedal was made with incredible craftsmanship. It will easily last 10 years.                
Great pedal for a great price. I would gladly pay more then the retailed price.                
This pedal is a must have. Looks and plays great. Buy it NOW!                
This pedal sounds SICK!!! It sounds like a wall of high gain amps yet it comes in such a small easy to use package. I play everything from Classic Rock to Death Metal and this pedal dose it all easily.                
This pedal is so easy to use. It has only 4 knobs: volume, low, high, and gain. You can easily dial in sounds. A child could find Metallica's tone in less than 15 seconds!                
I could literally toss this pedal off my two story house and it would probably only get louder! It's a BOSS what more can I say?                
The Metal Core should be priced a lot more than it is. I bought mine new for $99.99 and that's a steal.                
I will never neet an other pedal again for metal.                
The sound is sick. This pedal can be used for just about any style of rock and metal. From smoth overdrive to insane rediculous distortion this pedal can do it. It is by far the best sounding distortion pedal on the market.                
The best.                
Most pedals today have a bunch of anoying knobs that can confuse many players, but BOSS takes away the problemb with 4 simple dials.
Volume, Low, High, Distortion.                
I can literally through this pedal off my house without it breaking.                
This product is worth twice what I paied for it which was about $110.                
All my friends who used it want it.                
What more is there to say?                
This pedal is an amazing high gain pedal that delivers that earth shuttering ferocious distortion that us metal heads have been looking for. It is most compatible with nu metal, death metal, metalcore, most types of metal. It just sounds amazing, I run it through a Peavey 6505 plus head. All I have to say is oh my god. Its really sharp and has lows that will shake the ground and knock down paintings. Hell ya!                
4 knobs is all it needs. You got the low adjusts and everything.                
Its a pedal.                
Looks great, black metal look, very sleek finish.                
Pretty cheap, for a edal of its sound. I'd buy it anyday.                
Haven't need to use it, I'll put 10 as a default.                
Although I'm not sexually interested in pedals, I have to say, this pedal looks like a beast.                
It is great. You can make a nice rythym sound when you scoop out some highs, turn up the lows, and it sounds so good. Vice-Versa for a lead tone. The distortion is great. I wasnt gidding the distortion on my Traynor YCV-40, it has as much distortion as metal core when it is turned up a little. The sound is so great because, it s so distorted but single notes are clear, but stll ferocoious. great sound. It doesnt have that fuzz that just makes you sound like mud.                
Just the distortion. But that deserves a ten by itself.                
Extremely easy, turn it on and melt some faces.                
Nice metal. It is durable as all Boss products. It's great.                
Its worth it for anyone who plays anything from Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, to Cradle of Flth to Ozzy.                
the only problem is that the patch cords come out when you accidently step on them. I havent reached them.                
its beatiful. it sparkles and is eye catching.                
GET IT!!!!! It kicks ass!!!!!                
The sound is amazing. It is a really heavy pedal and thats what i like about it. If you like to drop tune to C or B like me, then this is the pedal for you. It can give lots of chunky, over the top sound. There's some feedback but that's not a problem. My amp has pretty good distortion on it for playing pantera and stuff, but this pedal multiplies it by 5. Its SO HEAVY!!                
You can change the tone really easily. If you want a really heavy rythm tone, turn up the lows and distortion and dial back the highs. If you want a lead town with lots of sustain, crank up the highs.                
level, low, high, dist knobs. How much easier can it get?                
This thing is a BEAST!!! Its small but it kills. It will survive the next three nuclear wars. Maybe not, but you know what i mean.                
I'd pay 200 for this pedal.                
only problems ive had are with the patch cords staying in.                
I was a little nervous about getting this pedal cause i didn't know if it would match up to the distortion on my amp. Now that i have it, i like it more than my guitar.                
Two words: GET IT!!!!!!!!!!                
Lets see, you get:
112 effect types
3 loops for you own pedals
a tuner
MIDI control (out)
I use mine with my EVH 5150 III 50 watt head, so my patches also control channel switching. This pedal is actually smaller than the amps footswitch. Also I use a DigiTech Drop pedal, it's a bit better than the built in pitch shift in the MS-3.
It's got everything I need, the acoustic simulator cleans up the amp even cleaner than it is by default. Also with the patches you can adjust to equalize the volume disparity between channel 1 and 2.
first off i had been looking for a new pedal. i browsed about 50, give or take, pedals reviewing sound and quality of each one. then i came across the metal zone and loved it. luckly i got mine from a pawn shop. the lady said "i've got one distortion pedal thing" i thought great a $20 pedal. but to my supprise she put the metal zone up on the counter for $50 and i traded her for my marshall 10 watt practice amp (bought at $80). sound is awesome. the quality is awesome. its very responsive effect pedal, whether your chugging strings open or palm muting. this is def. a pedal for rock and metal genres. overall tone is unbelievable. the diversity in this pedal is amazing. if you want a soft to hardcore sound. i would encourage you to purchase the metal zone. with that said if you're looking for black metal type sound might want to check out Boss Metal Core pedal.                 
its sucks that you dont get a power cable with the pedal, but, its not an inconvience. 9v battery life is long. only applies battery power when cables are plugged in "like active pickups in guitars" Boss also provides power cables for sale and have pedal power boards for this product. its got a solid frame and a sturdy spring under the switch so you dont have that accidental off flip while playing. once you stomp that badboy it doesn't let you down even if battery power is low. play it enough you'll find from your own experiance that this is a great petal for any guitar players gear.                
its easy, just turn the knobs until you feel the tingle in your fingers wanting to play. straight forward controls, i play a modular ibanez half stack with the metal zone atm, next to a peavey 5150 tube amp. of my friend. i can honestly say you can tell the metal zone has a "generated sound" compared to a 5150, but, it doesnt stand out. overall the ibanez amp with the metal zone can and does generate the sound of a tube amp and does a great job doing it. keep that in mind for all those on a budget.                  
look at the pictures its cool and will last quiet a few shows. you might say $100 pedal or a $10 pedal. you get what you pay for. metal zone price may seem high, but, you may need to come down off you possible high if you go pay $10 for a pedal that will last one show, if that. the box frame helps ensure that the pedal doesn't start to warp over time. rounded pedals with plastic buttons will start wearing out before this one does.                 
its the bang for your buck.                
you dont need the support. these pedals were meant for one thing PLAYING. if you have to talk to support at anytime, then the product sucks and you should look else where. Boss support would be a dream job, setting and waiting for a phone that doesn't ring playing solitare on the computer instead of Boss Manufacturing Technical Support Catalog Software. Sweet. O.o                
it can be tough out there as a musician sometimes things that you need just are not in the budget. this pedal is a investment in my opinion. standard piece of equipment every guitarist should have. if you have active pickups, get a Boss Noise Suppressor pedal with the Boss Metal Zone to help cancel the static of your active pickups. im not going to go put a comment on the Boss NS pedal, its a must too for active pickups.                 
Boss is a great company to look at go research their products and decide for yourself if their worth your time. dont let reviews pursuade you to go buy products. thats how you find expensive garbage. its the companies job to sell them. search for audio and video displaying the product. what is the company doing to ensure your satisfaction? 
hope you enjoyed the review                
The MT2 allows the user to achieve distortion sounds from today's rock music to the Heavy Metal sounds of yesterday's rock.                 
The duel control knobs make it very easy for the fine tuning of your desired sound.                
Boss pedals are all set to a great height and angle for a natural yet solid foot motion.                
Built to last a lifetime.                 
This pedal originally sold for as much as $179.00 that was a little steep. Now the pedal is really a great bargain.                   
The boss support team is very knowledgeable about their products and are very helpful. I needed a part for one of my pedals before and they got it to me very quick. The only thing I did not like about boss is they way over charged me on the parts and shipping. If it wasn't for that they would have gotten a 10.                  
This thing is at the head of my effects chain and I just couldn't imagine ever having a different distortion. I've tried many distortions and found this one to be the absolute best.                 
If I ever had to replace the Metal Zone distortion pedal (because I fried it or something.)I would in a heartbeat. It can make just about any guitar setup sound like your playing from an overdriven Marshall stack. Also, this pedal changes with my musical tastes. As I get older I find that I'm turning the amount of distortion used down a little. But, When I really wanna shred. I turn it up and "BAM" I'm 19 again. Overall it's a great pedal.                 
I ordered this because i would'nt have my half stack in time for a show. So i was just going to run the pedal to a direct box into the p.a. and settle for whatever it gave me. so i tried it out on just my surround sound and my electric had no strings. so i plugged my acoustic electric (takamine) into the pedal and WOW i was impressed. it has a wide range of sound. the low was nice and punchy and very tight. mids were amazing as well. the highs kinda fizzled out but i believe thats due to my acoustic not really the pedal. great job and i recommened this for anyone playing august burns red, bvb, periphery, etc..                
It's pretty hard giving this monster less than 10 on sound since you can get ANY tone with it, so whatever sound sounds like 10 on 10 for you, it can do it :) I was going to get a new amp but I bought this instead and I get killer tones with even my cheap 15w Peavey Rage 158.                
Well it's got more than any other single effect I've ever seen, and the parametric mids really make it stand out. The rubber pad underneath and on the footswitch make it very difficult to slip around and the recessed knobs prevent accidental tone adjustments. Really, what more can you ask?                
First off, the manual kind of sucked, but apart from that, this pedal is really easy to use. I just spent an hour or so playing around with the settings and now I can quickly get pretty much any sound I want.                
Just from the look of it, you can tell this thing is built to last a long time. Nothing to complain about for sound quality though.                
Well 100$ might seem pretty steep but keep in mind that you can get much more tones out of this that most other effect pedals so I think it's worth it. I tried it 10 minutes at the guitar shop and it's all it took me to be convinced.                
Didn't have to deal with them, but I shouldn't have to.                
The design is very simple, yet appealing. Orange text on black steel always looks nice :) I mean come on, just look at it, it's fricking sexy.                
I don't think I'm ever going to get rid of this wonderful pedal. Even if I someday get a great quality full stack I think this will still be a nice addition to my setup. It improved my tone by a factor of about 69000, give or take a few thousands. I tried my friend's digitech Hot Head and I like the MT2 much better.                
Amazing. Absolutely AMAZING. 10s are rare for me, but this pedal deserves it... BIG TIME. You can get ANY sound out of it, from thrash-scoops to mid-boosted solos to screaming 80's firepower to dirty nu metal rumble. And thats with the gain knob cranked to the max. Vary it around, and you get a nice, bluesy drive; a crunch, or WHATEVER. Blues players, overdrivers, dont be fooled by the name. This pedal can do it ALL, and it sounds good, too.                
For a stomper, this thing has a wide variety of features. Theres the gain knob (which the DigiTech Death Metal lacks, still a good pedal), the low, high, and mid knobs (the latter isnt on the average ML-2 Metal Core), the standard Level knob (name a distortion stomper without a level knob), and the Mid Freq knob (my personal favorite). The gain knob controls the gain. The level knob controls the volume. The low, mid, and high knobs control the low, mid, and high frequencies, respectively, and the mid freq shapes the mid to make it cutting-edge treble to warm, rumbling bass. All thats missing is a prescence knob, but thats all right. This pedal is jam-packed w/ features enough.                
W/ all of the knobs, it might be confusing for a beginner. But I know how to work these pedals, so that doesnt affect me.                
One word: Boss.                
If youre on a budget, then the DigiTech Death Metal is your pedal. After all, this pedal is twice as much as the DigiTech. But $99 for the best distortion stomper is a pretty good deal in my mind. $99 might be a bit expensive, but its worth every penny.                
I dont know, so Ill give it a 5 by default.                
It looks pretty good (who knew orange on black worked so well), but if your REALLY looking for the chicks, get the Boss Blues Driver or the DigiTech Death Metal.                
When I give a pedal a 9 overall (more like a 9.5 boardering 10) you KNOW that pedal is good. But calling this pedal good is an understatement. Calling it the best distortion stompbox EVER is more like it. For $99, you cant go wrong with it. Bottom Line: This pedal is legendary for a good reason.                
The sound is amazing.  I have several other distortion pedals, and for Metal/Hard Rock...this is the king.  It adds the distortion you want, but doesnt muddy  it up.  Some of the other pedals I have do not keep the tonal clarity of the Boss.                
I love the complete tonal variance of the built-in EQ.  Unlike other pedals that just have "tone" this pedal allows you to sculpt the tone how you want...                
This was not my first MT-2....so I knew how to set it up in seconds.  I have had it for 3 weeks this time, and I am still adjusting the EQ to get more and more tones.  I keep a book of settings and sound shapes so that if I want to go back and recreate one....I can easily.                
I dont know about this pedal....but my TU-2 tuner pedal is 10+ years old....and my Harmonist is even older, all working perfectly. The paint is durable and will take years of abuse.                
You can't beat this pedal.  It is what it is....a Hard Rock/Medal pedal that does allow for tone shaping to get just what yuou want.  With all the posibilities, I might have to get another one with different sound maps.                
I have never had to contact them, never had a problem with one of their products.                
This pedal does what it says, delivers Metal sound, with no fuss.  You can set it up quickly with a nice mid scoop, dial the gain up, and shred the night away.....Or, you can custom tailor you tone with built-in EQ.  This is not just another Tone + or - setup, but you can customize your sound to your taste.
This is the one pedal that will keep you coming back.  It did with me.  This is my second one...and I wonder why I ever stopped using it.  It is too versitile to jsut toss away.                
I've been trying to build a pedal board, started about a month ago with the Hardwire TL2 Metal Distortion.  It sounded ok, but wasn't close to what I was looking for.  Got this Boss MT2 Metal Zone Distortion pedal for Christmas, and I will say that it has really great all around sound, mids, lows, highs, it's all there.  I am selling the Hardwire pedal now because I will never use it.  I couldn't be happier with this Boss pedal, you can change the tones, distortion, volume gets loud if you want it to.  Overall, this pedal gives me all the sound I have been looking for with a lower priced distortion pedal.  You won't regret buying one.  The digitech pedal sounds very dull compared to this pedal.  I like the Boss SO MUCH MORE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
From the squeal of the upper frets to the raging boom of Drop-D tuning, this lil' bastard can do it all                
Built in mid range frequency adjustment allows you to go from a thin, squealy Metallica-esque trebley sound to a broad, thick "Ozzy Osbourne - Crazy Train"-esque sound.                
Built like a bomb shelter, I bet if a tornado picked this thing up and threw it into the ocean and 50 years later some divers found it and returned it to me, it would still work                
Great value, this thing is awesome, no doubt about it                
Its Boss, so I assume they have great support, but I haven't talked to them                
First pedal I ever bought, last pedal I'd ever sell                
Perfect for any kind of hard rock, and if you've got guts, jazz and blues as well                
It gives you so much control that you can go from light dirty clean to metal. It would be nice if they had put a octave switch in it but no complaints. one of the best pedals I have ewver owned.                
The most useful thing that I found on this pedal is the control of the amount of distortion that you want and the tone adjustments.                
There is now way to ruin this pedal it wil take a beaten but will still work like new.                
The price may seem a little high but when you get it you say to your self that you'll never regret paying that price.                
I have never had a problem so I have never had to deal with the company but have dealt with a lot of their products and love them all.                
The looks are great the pedal just looks so awsome that it one that makes the pedal rack lokk even better than it did.                
Overall this is the best pedal I own thats over a Korg A5.
Great product for the price.                
This little box by Boss has a great tone.  I have listened to many distortion effects over the years, but this effect  is just what I have wanted. I am very happy with it.  I did not buy the Boss power cable, but purchased a different manufactures and hooked it thru a daisey chain.    No problems/Very happy !                
The sound is awsome ,, ofcourse depending what you play. i play Alot of Metallica! and heavy stuff, it plays less heavy pretty well,,ppl that diss the sound.. pls learn how to used it first                
nice equalizer man, sound goes great with my effects gear                
well took me awile to use it, i got it second hand, when i got the hang of the equalizer,, this thing rocked,,                 
small pedal but undestructable!! do i need to say more,, i had this pedal for awile and if it can stand my beating,,i can approve this pedal to anyone                
top noch value for me,, i paid 60 bucks canadian for it,, it buy far my favorite pedal                
second hand, no support                
its a tank,, need i say more                
well i have this pedal for awile and its still awsome,, if it quits on me i'll go buy another one,,i wanted this thing as soon as i saw it,,like i said it goes great with my fx..its a good hard rock to heavy sound,,it made my crappy 5w sound good! i'm on a 30 w now,, theres no comparing                
The sound is great, you can go from thick metal or thrash (my favorite), to overdrive and blues/rock.  If your amp has weak distortion on it (like mine (Behringer GMX1200H), this pedal will take care of it.                
I love the 4 band EQ, it's got great bottem end and thrashing highs.  The distortion has a nice tone too.                
It's a BOSS, built like a tank.                
Worth the price by far.                
Haven't had to deal with them.                
It's very sexy.                
My amp head's distortion was very crunchy and not as powerful as I wanted it to be, and I heard/read about this pedal, so I decided to try it out and after I did I bought it immediatly.  It has such a great tone for metal, thrash, blues, rock, just use the 4 band EQ and scope out your sound, I garentee you'll find it.                
The most versatile distortion I've ever heard. From long, singing sustain, to harsh edgy rock and metal, it does it all !                
Very easy to use controls and easy access battery compartment.                
Built like a tank !                
After trying about 20 different distortion pedals including Fulltone, this pedal is the freaking BEST !                
Great customer support service online.                
Nice looking and sounds superb !                
I will have this forever. I have been searching for *this* type of sound for many years.                
i got mine used and its in perfect condition still, the whole thing barely has a scratch. it owns                
yes it is.                
it looks so cool, and plays so damn well, how could u not get one?                
i think the only reason i would have for buying a new effect would be if i wanted to experiment with different sounds and effects, this one pedal does the job so far, the reason i bought this pedal was because my guitarist friend had one and another boss and i played with both and chose this one, it was the perfect sound. i love how easy everything is about it, i dont have anything bad to say about it, for now.............                
Play with it long enough and you can get plenty of different tones. It added sustain, quite nice for my cheap bolt-on ibanez. However, the overall sound quality is what I would refer to as 'tinny'... course you can't expect a big tube amp in a pedal, and maybe I'll tune that out in time... but if your ears are keen you'll know it's digital, imo. And if you're a basement jammer like me, that doesn't matter too much, the boost this gives over my little Peavy "Rage" 158's distortion is great. Finally, I'd like to say the mechanical quality is up there with heavy weaponry (tanks), and if I can swing it, I'll be looking for their overdrive and perhaps noise silencer pedals sooner or later.                
Sound is awesome. excellent for any kind of metal and quite good for other genres such as rock. You can get a variety of sounds with the EQ. But of course, its most suited to metal, therefore you might not be able to get the perfect sound for other genres.                
The EQ is awesome and gives you lots of variety. It has pretty much everything a distortion pedal should need.                
Its very well made, like all BOSS products. metal casing, virtually bomb proof. I wouldn't be surprised if it still worked after you threw it off the top of a tall building.                
Awesome value. Heaps of bang for your buck.                
Have never dealt with them.                
Looks awesome. a metallic black color. looks mean and nasty.                 
This is, in my opinion, the best distortion pedal you can buy. Especially if your into metal. Great for that metallica sound.                 
This is the best sounding pedal out without a doubt in my mind                
could be a little cheaper, but you forget about the price once you play with it                
covered for 5 years                
This made my $250 fender champ 300 amp sound like my friends $1200 crate halfstack amp.  A must buy if you are into any type of metal or hard rock, from metallica to unearth. Stop thinking about it and go but it!                
what can i say.its a versatile distortion pedal.from 70`s rock to heavy metal.trust me,you`re gonna love this pedal.                
with its 3 band EQ,you can create any tone that you desire.                
its a boss pedal.its like a tank!                
this pedal takes 3 months for me to own it.thank god,its worth of every penny.                
Must get it!                
The Dist of it is PERFECT for metal.
i get a very unique sound out of it, is close to 
dino cazares sound in Fear Factory Obsolete                
It a very good Equalizer and distortion to break your amp                
Is not for noobs. it has a wide range of tones                
Is a tank, imposible to break                
it worth te money                
never used it                
the color is black with orange letters
perfect for metal                
The metal dist EVER!                
this is very cool i can get screaming distortion that comes with hours of sustain                
very high quality pedal for anyone playing metal                
this is the highest quality pedal i own it will probabaly outlast me.                
this is worthit so buy it now!                
Wow. THIS is the metal sound. THIS is metal. And it sounds SICK. Flat-Out SICK. I used it in conjunction with a noise gate, EQ, and compressor, and let me tell you, this thing kicks a$$... big time. Its a LOT better than the Metalcore pedal, and a lot, LOT better than the DS-1 I own. Also, its more inspiring than the Danelectro FAB Metal I own. This is probably the best hi-gain pedal I've heard.                
Its a pedal. Whats to expect? Well, it has more features than most.                
With more features than the average pedal, its harder to use. But still. Its a pedal. Just stomp and play.                
One word:Boss.                
Sorry, but $99 is pricey for this pedal.                
This is by default. Havent used it.                
Its a pedal, but its fricking BLACK!                 
Its Boss. Its a pedal. Its a Boss Pedal. Its a metal pedal. Its a Boss metal pedal, and its the best metal pedal Ive ever heard! If youre still reading and considering whether to get it, youre an IDIOT! Just take that cash and BUY IT!                
The sound it great.  Great quality. One of this pedals strong points.                
It is simple but has everything you need.  If you play around with the knobs you'll find a sound you like.  But you need the power adapter, which is why I gave this an 8.  The batteries only last about 20 minutes.                
Really easy to figure out.  And the manual shows you how to get different sounds.                
Solid metal construction.                  
Pretty expensive... but definitely worth it.                
Have never needed it.                
Looks great                
The only distortion pedal you will ever need.  Has everything from slight overdrive for Pink Floyd solos, to Heavy distortion for isanely dark metal riffs.                
great sounding anything from hard rock to heavy metal                
built to last                
could be cheaper                
5 year warranty is pretty good                
it has awesome looks                
great pedal u need to go out and get it                
I actually have TWO of these, one is a "newer" 1998 black label model that I got used off eBay. The other one I've had for at least twenty seven years now and have never had any problems with it, I got the old one used off my best friend in hardly ever used, mint condition, he didn't ever use it, need it or want it, he went with a computerized midi rack system back in the late 80's and was selling off all his old analog stuff, it's an old green label model and it has held up fine and still looks new. I find it hard to get the equalization exactly where I want it on either model though! I either get too much low-end, not enough, too much mid-range or not enough, or way too much treble! I wish either one gave a little more punch and crunch but they DO sound much better than MANY dozens of Distortion pedals that I own or have tried, disliked and sold off! I have considered getting one or both of these modded but have not yet done so! I have tried or used them both through many Tube and Solid state amps, tiny practice amps, etc., and find the sound roughly the same from both pedals, except that the older one might give a little dirtier sound at a high gain than the newer one.                
this pedal is amazing! so much distortion, more than you'll know what to do with. ive played it lots of times and loved every second of it! the 3 band eq is great..lots of sound options.                 
the 3 band eq says it all... ~                
IT'S SO EASY... A CAVEMAN COULD DO IT.                
mind-boggling...you can drop it and wont hurt it a bit...
maybe a paint chip here or there. :P                
yea...100 bucks.. alot of money but its really worth it.
the wide variety of sounds and so much gain for metal/ death metal/hardcore...                
um...great..i guess...ha...but yea awesome                
i was going to get it 2weeks ago but i got the boss dd-6 digital delay...i could decide on whice one but the METAL ZONE IS NEXT ON MY LIST...A.S.A.P !!!!!,..... i need it                
JUST SIMPLY AMAZING                
Adjustable to any kinda music you like to play: From the hounds of hell to Elvis through an old fifties radio....
Get's a bit blurry with high amounds of treble and middle                 
It's Boss. Always good products, though not my favorite.                
Still Boss.                
It rocks..                
I've purchased 2 of these. I get the sound I want from the pedal and it can take a beating except for the input jacks on the pedal. I've had the input jacks on the pedal give out on me on both the pedals. I have to frequently jiggle the pedal in order for the feedback to quit. Sometimes feedback is very loud and sometimes quiet. Other times whenever there is no feed back it often acts as though I have turned the volume from the pedal very low. I have tested my cables and guitar jack all separately using the same half stack and have never seen any of the symptoms appear.                
I really like the sound of this pedal. I can find pretty much every setup for the kind of musik i like (Metallica, Iron Maiden, Jimi Hendrix and so...)
Today i tried to make fuzz setup, and i really couldn't get it sound the way I wanted it. Then i cut of the tone of the brigde pickup, and then i had the more Jimi Hendrix old 70's fuzz sound. Amazing!                
I have to this pedal has a great range of tones, because of the extra equalizers on it. The one I find best, is the middle/frequence-sound. Jesus it can really create the tone you want!                
At first I  have to say it is pretty hard to get the right sound, but that's also it. You will have to tweak the knobs many times, but if the musik you like is in the category of metal/rock and so, you will find it!                
I have bought three different BOSS pedals, and neither one of them has ever cost me any trouble. I think it is almost impossible to destroy this pedal! It is A TANK!                
This pedal is all worth it. I could not see how it shouldn't have this price. You can use this pedal for so many different bands, and it truly delivers the tone I want!                
I don't know, because I haven't had a single problem with any of my BOSS pedals!                
I like everything this pedal. The color, te way it's built, it's a part of my music!                
I will definately keep using this product, because it fits so good into the kind of my music. I do not like the extremely heavy, death kind of metal, but then; I don't even have to play that. I can make it sound like I want! NICE!                
Awesome                
The Best                
This pedal is durable.                
Yes this product is the best.                
The pedal is flawless.                
It's badass!                
This pedal is very versible and durable.                
I PICKED UP THIS PRODUCT LAST WEEK. I HAVE A FENDER STRATOCASTER AND IT MAKES IT SOUND AMAZING. WITH BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU WANT YOUR PEDAL TO OPERATE IT IS COOL. I HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH THIS PRODUCT.                
IT DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY ACCESSORIES, BUT THIS EFFECTS PEDAL IS SOMETHING THAT TOPS ALL THE OTHER BRANDS IN GUITAR EFFECTS FOR METAL. THE MOST USEFUL FEATURES ARE NOT HAVING TO ADJUST IT THAT MUCH IT IS READY TO JAM WITH EVERYTIME. I WISH IT CAME WITH A CABLE TO CONNECT OTHER EFFECTS PEDALS. THIS IS MY FIRST GUITAR EFFECTS PEDAL AND I PLUGGED IT IN TO MY FENDER AND MY LITTLE CRATE AMP AND IT IS AMAZING THE SOUNDS THAT CAN COME OUT OF THAT THING FOR NOT BEING A 200 OR 300 DOLLAR AMP.                
I THINK THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD HURT THIS PEDAL IS IF YOU DROPPED IT IN A SWIMMING POOL, OR THROW IT AGINST THE WALL. THIS ITEM IS WELL BUILT AND I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING BREAKING MY FRIEND HAD A METAL MASTER OR SOMETHING MADE BY DIGITECH AND IT WAS A PIECE OF CRAP.                
YOU KNOW YOU CANT GO OUT AND GET A PAUL REED SMITH FOR $500 YOU GOT TO PAY THE PRICE AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE PRICE'S THAT BOSS HAS                 
I HAVEN'T HAD TO CALL THEM OR ANYTHING CAUSE "BOSS" MAKES THE BEST EFFECTS I BELIEVE AND IF I DID WRITE THEM IT WOULD BE A COMPLIMENT LETTER SAYING THANK YOU FOR ALL THE COOL STUFF YOU MAKE FOR GUITARS.                 
THIS PRODUCT HAS JUST THE RIGHT TOUCH TO ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF                
It has so many different sounds you can get with, it is just amazing.  I had no idea that there was that many different sounds of distortion.                
The 2 middle knobs have knobs around them, which I enver saw before.                
I own other Boss pedals and they dont have any problems with durability.                
It is a little bit pricey, but after playing it for the first time you wont even care that you spent 100 bucks for it.                
Boss are and always will be on of the best pedals.                
I like the MXR pedals look the best, so if this pedals looked like that I would pay about 200, but this one is pretty dull, but again its worth it for the sound you get out of it.                
With all the possibilities on this thing I dont think I could ever get bored of it.                
It sounds awesome. Way better than all the other pedals I've ever played with. There are so many different sounds you can get from this thing.                
The dist knob is really cool. I love how you can go from a nice bluesy tone to a huge heavy metal sound.                
Ease of use? Umm... you turn the knobs until you get the sound you want. How hard could it really be?                
Metal pedal made of metal. The only problem I have ever had with it was actually my fault. I didn't screw the thumb screw all the way in and it popped open once. I like the rubber on the bottom and top.                
Yeah, I know. $100. But... it's worth it. I would buy it again if I somehow went back in time. It's highly unlikely, but I would. I got what I payed for and then some.                
No experience yet, and I never plan on it.                
I don't know how I have lived without this thing for so long. Five minutes in Guitar Center and I was hooked. I dreamed about it for months before finaly getting it. It looks cool too. Boss pedals all seem to look way cooler than any others. Plus, you can play almost anything through it. White Stripes? done. System of a Down? done. Nirvana? done. The Pink Panther Theme song? done. Hawaii 5-0? done. Rise Against? Weezer? Ramones? AC/DC? done. I even play Miley Cyrus' "Party In The USA" with a droptuned guitar. It makes people laugh. Also, I love the song.                
This is my first pedal, and I am extremely happy with it. I'm not the best guitarist in the world by far. I'm still learning. But I sound awesome when I play "State of the Union" by Rise Against, or "According To You" by Orianthi through this pedal. I love to play so much more now. And I started writing songs again. I was never really much into heavy metal. I love System of a Down and can play some of their songs though, and they sound so cool now. Oh yeah, I got the power cord thing for it. Which was a good idea cuz I ran the battery down pretty fast. But then again, I played it all day at high volume. Anyway, you should get it because batteries are retardedly expensive. If you are considering it, just buy it. If you are not considering it, you should be. If you have it already, good for you. Wether you play heavy metal or not, you'll like this pedal.                
This is, hands down, the best distortion pedal to ever hit the musician market.  This pedal really is everything you really need in terms of distortion.  I would really not have it any other way.  I used to use a BOSS DS-1 Distortion, but after hearing the MT-2, I moved onto it, as my tastes in death/brutal metal increased.  I sold off my DS-1 for it was nothing compared to the Metal Zone.  Not only is the distortion much better, but you can make the Metal Zone into a wussy overdrive if you wanted to.  So it really suits any need, although the name would probably turn off most prog/punk/pop rock musicians.  However, this thing makes even a crappy amp sound pretty powerful.  I liked the DS-1, but the MT-2 is much much better.  You're actually better off paying more for the MT-2.  The soud quality is just uncomparable.                
I really like how it had much more than the Metal Core pedal in terms of EQ, and unlike the DS-1, it actually had an EQ.  What's so lovely about the MT-2, is that it has 4 customizable bands.  The high, low, mid, and mid freq.  My personal favorite is the mid freq, for it really defines everything, and makes the distortion sharp (like using a bridge pickup) or mellow (like using a neck pickup), depending on how high or low you crank it.  I like it all the way up, for I like sharp distortion, but the point is, is that the option is open to you.  It really is a custom pedal, made for artists who like to own their own sound.  This thing will get the job done.                
Honestly, if you're a complete, 100% noob, you might want to settle for the regular DS-1 Distortion like I did before moving onto the MT-2, because this pedal requires a little bit of knowledge, but even more of a trained ear.  Although 4 might not be a big number, you'll be suprised at how much you can do with those, and it may be a little overwhelming to the complete beginner.  But once you get a very basic hint, it's very very easy to use.                
This product is just like everyone says.  A tank.  I constantly tour Japan in livehouses, and I knock this thing around by accident on stage all of the time, or backstage, or whatever the hell I might be doing.  Let's just say that I'm not the most careful of people when it comes to this thing.  Aside from the pain chipping off pretty easily, this thing is solid, and I'm very certain that it will last me until the day I die and then some.  I also find the color quite appealing.  I never knew black and orange could mix so well.  BOSS knows their stuff.                
It has already been stated that it may be pricey for those of you who have little money or who are starving artists, but even so, once you see what this thing is capable of, you'll forget about that problem, and you won't regret it at all.  Trust me.                
I only had to call them once, and that was when I owned my DS-1 because the jack "died" out on me.  They were pretty cool, and it only took a few minutes for me to figure out what was wrong.  BOSS is truly one of the best corporations in the world.  Many people say that the world doesn't care about you.  Well, the employees in BOSS truly do care about your satisfaction with their product.                
I personally believe that, if you like any form of rock, especially metal, you are not complete without this pedal.  It should be the sole fundamental of any metal musician.  Not only is it pretty good looking (at least to me), the sound kicks every other distortion pedal's ass right out of the water.                
This is the best distortion pedal ever made, and ever will be made.  Although this pedal is 16 years old, is still remains to be truly the greatest metal pedal.  It will last you a lifetime of perfect sound.  As you get older, it's normal that you will rather stray from heavier stuff, but it's okay, because the MT-2 covers you.  This can be a badass metal distortion pedal, or it can be a light overdrive pedal.  it's anything you want it to be.                
it farl steller but i dont think that its as metal as i would like it 
for i want it to be more brutal but that might be my fender twins fault                 
the pedal is very simple and easy to use 
and its nice to look at the eq on it is amasing                
its veary easy to use                 
it is very good i play it for hours at a time and i havent had one problem 
but i have only owned it for a couple of mounths                 
it great i would have paid another houndred dollers forit                 
there isnt any need for but i dont think so                
it realy turns the ladys on when you pull out a guitar and do a nose bleedingly fast solo
in to a neck snaping metal rift                 
im glad i bought it but if an one knows of another pedal that is beter for death metal 
i would love to know 
contact me at monky-maker@hotmail.com                
i got the MT-2 just a month ago and its been hard to put down the guitar ever since. i used to rely on multi processors before getting the MT-2 and i have to say there is a major difference. Notes sound definitely cleare with the MT-2 even when compared to the metal dist of the ME-50. I got a GE-7 immediately and man have i been crushing walls with them two together. its a classic nothing will ever replace it.                
the 3 band EQ..enough said                
what i like about it is that you have to do the tweakin ur self unlike the spoon feeding multi processors give you..and its not exactly easy but man is it rewarding once you get the sound you want out of it                
its a BoSS,,,                
worth every buck..                
I think if your that guy or gal who would want to ride into the world of building an analog setup..especially if your that kind who wants versatility,dammit get an MT-2...life time investment is the word.                
In-freakin-credible! The Distortion is so heavy you will blow the brains of whoever is listening!                
Four Equalizers!                
Just plug and play, after you get the hang of the equalizers.                
Solidly made!                
It is worth every penny.                
Well, I have never had much problems with BOSS equipment, but they are helpful when it is needed.                
The genius of the pedal is so appealing, you will wonder how they did it.                
I will be satisfied with this product for several years. It has a wonderful tone and make that you can never go wrong with.                
The sound is wonderful!The only thing I can say is : OMFG SHE'S AWESOME!!!                
Power Cable sure does help a lot...                
You'll need some skills to be able to get an incredible sound like Iron Maiden,Megadeth...                
Everything's fine but sometimes...You can hear the radio...? Just forget that and play like hell!                
The price's a little high but when you can afford it...It doesn't cause much problem.                
It needs time like every company...                
You MUST own it.                
Nothing's better.                
4 equalizers!!!!! Rocks!!!                
Boss pedals are made of steal!!!!! Never will break.                
Great sound, tone and very versitile.                
im not sure what everone is raving about. this pedal sounds weak to me no settings i have it on. i play it with my 60watt marshall and the only way i use the pedal is on the distortion channel. i use my marshalls distortion and just use the pedal to adjust the highs and lows and mids.                
it made my single coils sound like humbuckers...i dont know like it made my crappy little practice amp sound like this huge tube blaster...i love that little thing...                
i like how it has complete access to controlling its equalizer so that way you can tweak it to whatever sound you want out of it                
the thing is a tank and can survive a bazooka...its really well made                
i dont know but boss is pretty good so id say it would be a good call                
it makes my friends jealous cos they only have little digitechs...                
boss metal zone is all i need for my tone in terms of metal...im set with it and im very pleased with it                
Wow, sound quality was un-beatable.  Awesome for metal / Punk rock Riffs and Solo's, absolutely awesome.  The brand name says it all.  BOSS                
Awesome make, holds together.  Looks BOSS                
WOW, can't beat the price, and best product ever for that price too.                
Wow, looks awesome, beautifull.  ITS BOSS!                
Beyond satisfied, 9 out of 10 since they didnt give it a polished gold finish, that would make a 10.                
When i got it, i first played it in a show so i didnt had time to make any setting so i was not really happy of the sound but when i plugged it at home i was surprised of its versatility                
this is a tank man                
To pricey but i really needed it so...                
You got to buy this if you like metallica megadeth etc... but if you prefer nu metal and stuff go for the digitech's metal master.                
ITS SO GOOD!!                
THEY ROCK                
VERY WELL MADE                
a little pricey, but its worth it                
DONT NEED IT YET                
chick magnet                
When you want metal you got it!  When you want to acent your guitar a little better you got it!  Its everything I've ever wanted and more!                
I use it alot, just wish the screw that holds the plate down over the battery was more secure, you can step on it bout 15 times, before the screw comes to use to use, easy to screw back in on stage though!                
I abuse this thing like crazy, when im up on stage, I go nuts, and have jumped on this thing like and elephant!                
It was worth the money I spent.                
never had to use it                
no comment                
Anything you need in a distortion pedal!                
high and low varibles on both of the equilizers, which allows for guitar solo sounds on the bottom strings aswel as heavy, dirty sounds on the top 3 strings                
it seems to be well built had no problems but mien came with 1 year guarentee from the shop and a 3 year with Boss                
it cost me                 
best distortion ever!!!                
features are perfect                
A1 quality....will never break....unless u smash it with a sledge hammer                
this pedal is worth every penny...buy it!!                
havent dealt with company                
i borrowed this pedal from my friend and it is incredible...ill probably be buying it soon                
i will be satisfied as long as the pedal works, and i dont think it will break                
Great Distortion                
Great                
Made extremely well. I've dropped it out a second story window and its worked better than ever.                
a little expensive but so worth it                
i dunno                
its....great                
I love it. I'll never use any other distortion pedal again.                
This baby ownz.  You can get just about ANY sound you want out of it.  I kind of would like to see about 10% more distortion capabilities though.  It has plenty of distortion but for me, I'd like to see just a little bit more.                
Everything you want: 3-band EQ, dist and level controls                
Built like a tank.  Body is all metal with rubber thing on bottom so it wont slip.                
It's a very nice pedal.  For $80 bucks its a sexy deal but some people can't spit out $80 bucks so it'd be nice if it were a little bit cheaper...like 60's range.                
Never dealt with them.                
Already have it.  The orange and black create a sexy appeal.                
VERY good deal.  I guarantee that you'll be satisfied with this pedal so if you're thinking about getting it, do it.                
Great sound you can get a powerfull bassy sound, crank the mids up and get some huge harmonix or take up the treble and in any ways after you find your preset(which can take a while) you will get an awesome sound that you won't ever want to play without.                
The 4 band EQ is pretty usefull because you have 2 for the mids and it really is the knobs that change the sound of this baby                
It's really built hard, I could never break it even if I like jumb on it                
Great for the price, I would pay pretty much anything to get a sound like that                
If it would break(almost can't happen), I'd buy another one                
Awesome product, the greatest distortion I have ever heard                
Yes, I have a fender stratocaster. And i used to have a DOD Death Metal distortion pedal. And it still sounds like a classic guitar. But when i brought home the Metal Zone from boss, the stratocaster does not sound close to the stratocaster. And unlike any other distortion pedal, you can set it to any type of distortion.                
You can use a ricinbacher and it would sound like a really heavy guitar.                
Yes i the Death Metal distorion lasted for only 6 months cause there is something wrong with the foot switch. Well I decided to get the metal zone and i have it for two years and it still works.                
All that i can say is it can blow away the overdrive on the amp and any other distortion pedal.                
No i have no dealt cause i know a lot of people that has boss pedals. Its not easy to reach in my neighborhood cause i live too far away for a music store. Plus i never needed any service it still works excellent.                
Not even with the stratocaster. The stratocaster plays good but with distortion, i dont like the sound of that. But with the metal zone, it sounds like a heavier guitar.                
I don't know but i will be waiting for another suprise. Metal Zone is tough to beat.                
Heavy distortion, very brittle sounding.  Great for heavy/thumping palm muting. Only sounds good in the bedroom. Does not cut through when gigging with a band (trust me).  Definitely fun to play with.                
Lots of tone control. But you can't get a natural "wet" distortion out of it.  Good for metal sound. Don't try to play blues or classic rock with it.                
One-trick pony. Does not cut through in a band setting because it has no mids                
Like I said: sounds cool in your bedroom.                
I've been playing for over 30 years, rock and blues primarily. I don't gig anymore. I do a ton of recording in a home studio. I have a pedal Pedal Train Pro board with 14 pedals in all, 4 different distortion/fuzz/overdrive pedals and a Flanger and Phaser, all of which produce unwanted noise in addition to noise generated by the guitar pickups, single coil or humbuckers. This pedal allows me to run the distortion peds and the phase/flange through the loop while keeping my time based pedals (reverb and delay) out of the loop so that the gate does not impede the reverb/delay. This pedal does a great job. My only regret is that I did not buy this years ago. As for the pedal coloring the sound? I hear no difference whatsoever. Loss of tone is not so much a pedal problem but having is caused by a long signal chain. If you hear the tone change try using the tone control on your ax, on your amp, or on your pedal board. That's why we have them. It's not rocket science.                
I keep reading a lot of reviews about how it kills your tone.  The only difference that I've noticed was just a little bit of a volume decrease, but all I have to do is turn it up louder.  I am using this pedal on a 200W Traynor tube amp head and a Marshall 1960A cabinet.  It will definitely kill the unwanted sound immediately.                  
Don't really need too many features on this.  What's on the pedal is all you need.                
It really wasn't that hard to get it setup.  But I will tell you right now, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!  It will tell you what the knobs do and how to set it up properly.  Once I read the instructions I set it up in no time.                  
It's a Boss pedal and it's built like a tank.                  
For the price I got this for it was worth every penny.  Get a daisy chain to supply other effects pedals that you have.                  
I got tired of hearing the unwanted noise from my amp at shows and band practices, so I wanted this pedal.                
Since I own the Metal Zone pedal, I expect this to last for a very long time.  I've only had a few effect pedals go bad on me, but they weren't Boss products.  If it ever went bad on me I would definitely buy another one.                  
This product works great after dis/od box. This product fails if you use amp distortion. Using this product in the fx loop produces bad results. If you use amp distortion I would recommend an isp noise reduction product or a MXR Smart-Gate in the fx-loop.                
When it comes to noise reduction it has all the knobs you need and a nifty silent mode. The drawback of having to run your fx threw the Ns-2 Separately from your guitar creates a more cluttered pedal board, Awkward cables are needed in order to get your last fx units sends back to the Ns-2 input, and this could be avoided if boss switched the fx inputs inputs around.                
Very easy to use product.                
Very dependable.                
Great value compared to what els is on the market.                
Boss support is very easy to get.                
It looked nice and easy to use.                
Gets the job done for moderately noisy equipment.                
I turned it on then off then on over and over again and could hear ZERO difference in quality!! This thing doesn't weaken or change your tone!                
Nothing came with it but what else do you need.                
Extremely user friendly I pulled it out of the box plugged it up played with the settings for about a minute and it worked great!                
Great quality of course its a Boss....                
I would have paid more for this product!                
haven't needed it.                
Its a sexy compact Boss Pedal!                
An amazing product, I had major noise coming from my amp and just plugged the thing up and it was all in the past.                
Before commenting on the BOSS NS-2 I should describe my rig: Mexican Tele w/ vintage '54's, NS-2, TU-2, Xotic RC Booster, Xotic AC Booster, CH-2, back to the NS-2, and finally to a Fender Blues Jr. Every guitarist is familiar with the infamous 'buzz' or 'hum', which is usually a result of single-coil pickups or simply electricity. Why wouldn't anyone buy a 'noise suppressor'? Let's take the "Hush" pedal for example. I experienced a great deal of sound degradation and returned the pedal an hour later. My guitar lost its natural tone, punch, and harmonics. So I figured that all 'noise suppressors' acted the same way and quickly lost interest in any such product. I recently put this rig together and gave 'noise suppression' one more shot. I picked one up and I love it! My sound is hardly affected. I keep the 'decay' at a minimum and put the 'threshold' at around 11 'o clock. This way the hum is barely detectable even in a quiet room by myself and my Tele still has its twang. This is the pedal to get. Essential for all guitarist. It's like taking the heartburn out of hot sauce and keeping all of the flavor.                
The NS-2 offers the option of powering additional pedals using a 'daisy chain', which is very useful. I placed the 'decay' knob at the minimum, which makes me wonder why it's even there. I wish BOSS would combine the NS-2 and the CS-3. This would save me some time and space.                
BOSS and beauty don't really go hand in hand, but this pedal along with other BOSS stompboxes are built like little tanks- reliable like a Honda and tough like Ford                
Price is very reasonable for the rewards and benefits of use                
N/A                
The pedals looks decent. I wouldn't have purchased it if it resembled a cookie.                
This is a keeper and if something happened to it...I'd buy another one.                
Pedal was easy to setup. No more noise when I stop playing while using my distortion pedals.                
Pedal does exactly what it is supposed to do. Takes the feedback from my hot humbuckers and tames it.                 
I use a large amount of gain between my amp and my ts9 overdrive and the NS-2 completely takes out the squeals that I can't stand. Also made my playing better due to everything getting noise gated.                
As usual Boss has come up with very unique ideas.  This is one of them that I am very impress with. It makes my Bass sound dynamic with the Fat Lows and the Punchy Mids and Crunchy Highs.  I am pleased to have it in my rig.                
Not really but for the price I got it for with the 3, 6" cables and the Boss PCS 20A parellel DC cords (Daisy Chain) plus 1 SPOT power adapter.  Hey I can't complain I am totally happy.. All for $75.97 Hey I am happy with tax and all.. LOL...                
As usual all Boss products are constructed very well.  I have no doubt in the material..                
Yes I got it at a heck of a price, I am happy... LOL                
No doubt but I was hoping to find a owners manual just like most of the other companies I have found online.  Just in case I lose mine I could download it and print it out online..                
Let's just say I am not kinky but the product suits the taste.. LOL..                
Well I can alway make additions to what I have now.  Because it is expandable..                
Does not change your tone if you set it up properly.  I read a zillion negative reviews by people who didn't use this correctly and then thought it was the pedal's fault.
Use all 4 jacks...this is not the same type of pedal as the mxr smart-gate or isp decimator, etc.   It's more like the ISP Decimator G-String but you get the save yourself $120 getting this instead of the g-string.  I've owned both and they're both great but this affords you more tweaking options and is way cheaper.                
All the things you need a gate to do in a guitar rig, this does.  Note:  It will not eliminate the sound from ground loop hum...if that's your problem, please look elsewhere.  (Ebtech makes some good devices for that ailment)                
I only gave this an 8 because although it couldn't be easier to use people seem to constantly use it wrong and then bash it for poor results which are, by and large, their own fault.  
For this to sound good right you'll need:
Dirt pedals into a clean amp or,
A separated preamp / power amp setup or,
An amp with a series effects loop (preamp out, poweramp in)
Your guitar goes into the NS-2 then out of its "Send" jack into your amp then from the amp's fx loop send into the "Return" jack on the NS-2 then out of its "out" jack into your delay, reverb, time based fx, then into your amps fx return.  
It will do what you hope it will in this configuration.  
Simply plugging this in between your guitar and amp is a waste of your time and money.  Also, never ever put delays, reverbs, time based effects before the ns2 or in its loop.  It will sound stupid that way.                
Its a boss pedal so you're good for at least 5 years out of this baby.                
When compared to the only equivalent noise suppressors on the market, this thing is a steal.  It does more than the MXR, the Rocktron, the cheaper ISP.  Its a great deal for high gain applications.                
haven't needed their help                
If you play rock, metal, hell even heavy blues, and you don't have a noise suppression system you're doing yourself, your tone, and especially your audience a disservice.  
If you need a noise suppression pedal...get this one.  Its dirt cheap for the help it'll give you and you won't be disappointed.                
If this breaks I'll buy another one instantly.
This shuts up your hum, hiss, and feedback and if you're not a dummy about how you use it then you won't even notice its on until you shut it off and hear all that old racket again.                
This noise suppressor sounds great. People say it alters ur tone..IT DOESNT. 
All it does it cut ur sustain a little bit...it works the best with humbuckers..i kno humbuckers dont make really any noise but just with my setup and surroundings i still get noise and it works amazing
On my strat however... i have to turn up the threshold up to get rid the noise when i use a lot of distortion...so it really cuts the sustain..but still works amaing...im really glad i got this one                
THe way it can power up to 7 other pedals is amazing!
i own 4 other boss pedals and a few others so it works great...
a mute mode works great when playing live and switching guitars.                
EXtremely easy of use!
much easier than like the MXR Smart Gate
(which also a very nice pedal)                
its built just like any boss pedal...STRONG!                
hmm...welll...85 bucks...a lot of money,but for the way it powers other pedals really made me buy this...
so                 
Boss is my favorite brand of pedals..i own five....Any question i ever had ,i always got a answer.                
umm... 
not really .. is doesnt look as impressive as the boss PH-3 or GT-8 or DD-6 Or PS-5...                
amazing...not a waste of money                
Well no sound is what you want here and yes, it delivers.
All the way on, things start to fade a bit.                
Don't use the decay or just set on min., mute is handy, plus power out is a great bonus to have.                
very solid unit                
hmmm. yeah I supose value was right.                
Boss are always good in this department                
I wanted it and was'nt let down.                
need to buy power apptor.                
This is where it separates from all the rest; i've used HUSH and MXR noise gates and BOTH left me lacking.  The HUSH worked great at killing the noise but it COMPLETELY clamped ANY sustain OR volume and the MXR well.....just sucked IMO.  This thing DOES NOT take ANYTHING away from your tone.  Dont believe the negative reviews on this, this pedal could easily sell for twice as much!  Take this from someone who; A. is a sound guru, i hate ANYTHING that colors my tone, B. someone who plays on a Peavey 5150 so needless to say that if i say this thing tames the noise, then it does! and C. from someone who is a recording nut! nothing about a bad tone can hide from me and this thing IMHO is as important to my rig as any guitar or speaker!                
Another great thing about this pedal, it can kill ANY noise produced by either your guitar's feedback in the front of the amp AND any noise that is produced by efx/in the efx loop AT THE SAME TIME!!!! what more could you want?                
Read the manual folks, its all there.........                
Its a friggin' Boss pedal remember? In the guitar community, when you hear Boss, you KNOW you are getting quality product.                
Invaluable!  Once you get this thing figured out to your liking, you will NEVER want to part with it!                
N/A. Never had to deal with them.  I've had a few questions about other pedals online and i received emails within less than 24hrs so id say its pretty good but the way i feel about it is, the quality in their pedals leaves no need for customer support.                
Appeal? READ THE REVIEW!!!!! Nuff' said!                
I couldnt be any happier with this pedal.  It does what i need and thensome.  Its a BOSS so im sure it will outlast my current band lineup LMFAO!!!!  Here's an example; i had a buddy that i let borrow my SD-1 about 10yrs ago, he brings it back, we BS some and lay it on the side of his truck.  Well, he goes to leave, then i see the pedal fall off the truck, then get RAN OVER and it DIDNT LEAVE A SCRATCH AND TO THIS DAY PLAYS LIKE NEW!!!!! and we arent talking a Ranger or Tacoma, it was full sized 2500HD chevy!!!! Tough as nails and simply put - THE BEST!!!!                
Sound? The point is to have less sound isn't it?                
There really are no features but the features that it don't have get an automatic 10 because it's fricken Boss!                
I wouldn't know, I only tried it out in a store and really all I did was turn it on but just that made it quiet so  guess it is pretty easy.                 
Top of the line quality, I mean it's fricken Boss is it not?!                
It had a reasonable price but not quite as amzingly priced as the DigiTech stomp boxes, they are insanely cheap!!!!                
I have needed no support                
It looks okay but what really matters is the sound not looks.                 
Overall it's a top notch pedal!                
The pedal does not directly affect your sound. The purpose of the pedal is to cut down on unwanted speaker hum, effects hum, pickup hum, etc. It does a great job doing it                
Includes a mute feature to completely mute the signal, and also includes the gate/suppressor                
It takes a little tweaking to get the decay and threshold to where you want them so your signal doesn't sound choppy, but once you find the sweet spot you will only have to adjust the knobs in minor amounts                
It's a BOSS. It's a beast.                
The pedal puts a dent in the bank, but I think it's worth every penny. I bought the pedal used (but in great condition) locally for about $60. It's totally worth it. It does exactly what I was hoping it would do.                
Haven't had to use the support yet, and I'm hoping I wont have to.                
I was considering buying this pedal for a few months, but once I started playing in a band, I realized that the time was right to buy one. Before I had this pedal, I had a LOT of noise coming from my amp (the amp itself, guitar, effects, etc.) Once I got this pedal, it cut back NEARLY ALL of the noise. I am VERY pleased. I would recommend this pedal to anyone who is looking to sound a bit cleaner without all the fuzz coming from their unit.                
Dosent degrade the sound like alot of other N.S. and can have a very soft "cut" to how it ends the signal, not abrupt or irratating.                
What more do you need? In my opinion the mute option is a bonus on this thing.                
Rugid as all hell. I've dropped it, dented the floor and not even scratched the paint of this thing.                
Cheap. Effective. Easy.                
Its a white Boss pedal. No suprises, no stupid graphics, no odd shapes that are hard to work with.                
Some of my friend's have this and when they use a battery it actually kills some noise but increases the hum. Always use an AC adaptor, no matter what.                
The sound of the regular, sub and poly modes just sounds like a very unpleasant synth; not real at all.  I was looking for something to just take my acoustic down an octave; this makes it boomy and fake, and not the cool kind.  
Another complaint about the poly mode: while it does track very well (MUCH better than the OC-2), even with range maxed out, the notes get quieter the higher up the scale they are.  Your E's will be blowing out the speakers and the D's will be barely noticeable.  Also, if you're using it while you're playing chords, the pedal often picks up two notes and plays them both an octave down, which sounds like crap.  You can fix this by lowering the 'range,' but by then it's not worth it anymore except maybe on a two-chord song.
That said, the sound of the distortion setting is pretty cool though.                
If you're looking for something to experiment with, create unique sounds with, or just play with, this is your pedal.  If you're looking to sound anything like you're playing bass when you're not, move along.                
Controls are simple and straightforward, that much it has going for it.                
If the pedal had a better sound in poly mode, I'd rate this much, much higher.  But as-is, this is just too much money for a pedal that just does this much unless you're into really off-the-wall sounds.                
Over-priced unless you just really want a pedal that does what this does.                
Gave it a 5 because I've never had to use them and don't expect to.  Boss makes good stuff.                
If you want an octave pedal, you want one that sounds better than this.                
It should be noted that I use this pedal just for guitar; I'm not speaking to what this can do for a bass, but frankly, they make five-string basses for not much more than this pedal, and if you want notes lower than that you're nuts.                
The OD-1X has that mild stubble tube like sound, to all out hard overdrive. A good buy. If lost or stolen. would buy another.                
I was drawn to this pedal because I already own the Boss DA2. Boss's Multi Dimensional Processing features a clarity unattainable without it. I use this OD-1X for my slightly dirty overdrive, and the DA-2 for heavier dirt. When dialing in some low end, it never turns "flubby" or "mushy", but always clear, so your actual playing is accurately represented.                
The sound of this product is an improvement over a prior version which I own.  I've purchased this unit to replace the PS2 Pitch-Shifter Delay.  Among the improvements to the PS6 is the octave setting.  In the octave setting, the delay is now almost imperceptible.  Also, as compared to the PS2, which sounds very digital, the PS6 sounds much more musical.                
Again, this product represents a distinct improvement over the PS2 in its controls.  It has notches on two of the function keys where it makes absolute sense to have notches.  The PS2 had no notches on the Shift and interval knobs.                
Again, this product wins by comparison to its early predecessor, the PS2.  While the PS2 could generate more than one note, the second note would be another octave, and usually involve a perceptible delay.  The PS6 produces multiple tones at chordal intervals allowing me to sound like I'm harmonizing with myself, and IN KEY as a result of the intelligent pitch-shifting function.                
This is consistent as any other Boss pedal I've owned and used.  It looks good, feels solid and is road ready.                
I thought that, as compared to other Boss pedals and products, this seemed a bit on the expensive side.  However, having used it near a month now, I think it is almost worth the price.                
I have had no customer service contact with Boss.  Therefore, I cannot comment.                
I don't consider this product sexy.  It looks like all of the other Boss products.  While its functions are neat, it's not like a big, creamy distortion, or a rich sounding chorus.  It will be a long time before I find anything sexy about a digital product.  But, that's just me.                
I hope not to have to replace it ever again as this is a replacement for a similar Boss product.                
very good,no tone sucking here! and excellent tracking.                
all features are very useful except for that dive bomb tremolo deal,its an Eddy Van Halen without the floyd rose. I don't do that on every song or do that at all don't see any use for it.                
no brainer if you know your basic theory as well as scale modes                
its a Boss of course!                
Zzound gave me a good deal                
its a pedal that I use for in some songs that require little pockets of nice solos that require good harmony's. its not something thats on all the time,but when you need it at the right places of the song during live gigs its a head turner.                
The Boss PS6 is very easy to use, the knobs provide nice tactile feel, I use only occasionally, as it is not a main-use pedal as with distortion, compression and a few other pedals. It is generally a good quality unit but I've had a couple problems with it due to its design. The main problem was the on/off indicator LED, while playing an outdoor gig and I could not tell if the unit were on or off because the LED was not bright enough. The low cost Behringer's I have on my board have much brighter LEDs so I can readily tell if their on or not. As we play to the public through the PA and our stage monitors have slightly different sound, it is not readily apparent sometimes when the PS6 is on or off. During a gig, you don't want to have to listen to see if the FX is on or not, by then its too late. The other problem was the toe of my shoe, while tapping a bit to the music accidentally lifted the top of the pedal off, so during the gig I had to reach down and reassemble the unit, which fortunately was quick, but it is something you should not have to worry about while performing. So, overall, a good unit but be wary of outdoor play during daylight. Can't comment on manufacturing support as I didn't use it, so I gave it 5 stars for support. Low score on ease of use due to the LED not being bright enough, that was a big deal for me.                
Great Amplifier Head. Lots of Power, Gain, and options. However not good for a player who needs a clean channel. But for the metal enthusiasts THE 6505 + IS the amp to set the bar...                
I've been playing guitar for quarter of the century but never owned a looper before, big mistake on my part, so when i decided to get one i did an extencive research, Dito was always at the top of a list, but i am an old timer and i started with Boss pedals 
just looking at one makes me feel like a teenager again, i also wanted something very simple and easy to use, the RC 3 looked like an obvious choice for just a little more cash, but who really needs 99 presets 3 hours of looping and cheesy drum beats with tiny little buttons to push to complicate things, no not me, one thing that attracted me in RC1 was a loop indicator, in fact i can't believe this is the only pedal that has one, seems like such an essential part of the pedal, i use the visual cue 100 precent of a time and can't imagine not having it in the looper, it shows you exactly where you are in the loop such an awesome idea and it looks great visually as well, however there is one flaw with the device, when you erase the loop by pressing down and holding for 2 seconds, you also get 2 seconds play back of the loop before its gone, thats not much of a problem for home use, but essentially renders the device unusable in the live situation, also from the online forums i have learned that the external foot switch cures that problem, i am yet to test it since i don't have one, however in my opinion such an omission should have never happened on the part of Roland, other than that after a few days of having the pedal i would still highly recommend one even if you need to get an external switch, there is just nothing else on the market with visual loop progression , also the audio comes out in CD quality i beleive no matter how many layers you create they are all perfectly balanced and sound like a professional sound engineer mixed them up.                
Very user friendly, very impressed with how "on time" it seems, I love this, I've gotten way better at my licks from practicing, and I've even layered beats , keyboards, and vocals, vocal looping is amazing, and thank you zZounds for the payment plan, now i feel like a pro and still have cash in my wallet!!!                
This product did what I expected. I wanted a tool to help me with lead guitar breaks, and harmonica solos. By laying down a rhythm progression, I am able to play it back, and work on these breaks to hone them to my liking. I was having difficulty with one particular song on the harmonica parts only to discover that I was using the wrong key harp. I'm only using it as a practice tool, and it works great as accompaniment.                
Had the orig. ditto for years thinking it was alright. Then purchased the EHX Nano 360 and the EHX 720,not being happy with either I returned and purchased the RC-3 Boss and it was so intuitive and feature laden I wish I'd have purchased this one first. The boss rc-3 is hands down my fav looper. I hate complicated pedals and this has Sooo many easy to use features that none of the other loopers have is unbelievable, especially being this looper isn't much more than it's competition-if you could even call it that. Plus with all the updates over the years. Thanks Boss! Am super fussy and REALLY liking this pedal. And thanks to zZounds for always giving me the best prices!                
Sound quality seemed good. This is the first and only pedal I've owned, so i can't compare to anything else. I played a Casino through a Vox Valvetronics amp. The recording seemed to be a bit soft, but can be adjusted with the output volume.                
Again, rating 8s across the board as I have no other comparisons to make, but it's plug and play. Super easy to use. I didn't like the original set-up with the record-overdub-playback order with the pedal, but it's super easy to change the order. Instruction very easy to follow.                
Seems solid. The single pedal rocks around a bit on the floor, but that's more the nature of its size. It's a solid piece of equipment.                
For what I wanted this is totally worth it. Love the included rhythm tracks. Super easy to use. Other items in this range seem short on features, so this is worth it.                
I got what I wanted and expected out of this pedal. Easy to use and great if you're on a budget.                
Great workout on songs tool and also a great solo player unit I can sing the songs better and play lead over the rhythms I record. Right now using about 20 of the 99 presets available.                
Does exactly what it is supposed to. The sound is true to what you played. And the volume of the loop is great for control at a live setting.                
I am having a blast with this loop station. Gotten to the point where it sounds like a full blown band with just one guitar. Now, I just sit back a play to my own background music. Anyway I want it........                
this thing is crazy cool to play with records and plays back exactly what you play through it .still learning but you take it out off the box and start jamming .thanks zZounds you are my go to music store                 
It duplicates exactly what you play into it. It has some cool effects that sound great but for what Im doing with it, I haven't found a use for them yet. Once you get your timing down for starting and stopping your loops you've got it made.                
The effects sound really cool but probably my least useful feature so far. For acoustic I'm just using a little chorus and reverb. The most useful is having two independent loops. I also bought the Boss fs6 foot switch which I recommend if you intend to use it live. It allows you to switch between loops on the fly.                
Sounds great from square 1. Very easy to use. As long as you have good timing you won't have any problems. If your timing is off your loop won't sound right when it loops but after a little practice you'll be making great sounding seamless loops.                
It's built like all Boss pedals. Solid as a rock. When Im on the road Boss is the only brand pedals I use and I've never had one fail me yet.                
I was a little hesitant at first because their are cheaper loopers on the market but the cheaper ones don't have the features this one has and after receiving and using this product I'd say it's worth twice what it sells for.                
I've never dealt with them because I've never had one of their products go down.                
I've had nothing but great experiences with Boss pedals and always look to them first when shopping pedals.                
I've been a Boss customer for a long time and I've thoroughly enjoyed this product to say the least. First and foremost, when you buy a Boss pedal the sound is second to none and the quality is the best I've seen in a pedal and this one is no differen. All steel cconstruction like all their pedals. The possibilities are endless with the rc-30. I bought it to use with my acoustic. I'm in the rock band Another Beautiful Letdown and my singer and I recently started picking up some acoustic gigs during down time to keep busy and keep our chops up. I mainly use this pedal to loop rhythm parts so I can add the lead parts live without the rhythm dropping out. I can tell that Im going to use this pedal alot the more gigs we do. I've only had it about 3 weeks so I've only tapped the surface of what this thing can do. I also like the rhythm section to use to just jam. It has 9 different rhythms and you set your own tempo. We build and layer our loops live so the crowd can hear each part being added but you can also save your loops to recall later which is cool. You can also load files from your computer to loop which I have not gotten to yet but Imsure tthat's in the near future. I could go on and on and I've only had the pedal 3 weeks. If your reading this you've come to the right place. You won't find this product any cheaper than Zzounds and their customer service is top notch. I highly recommend this product and Zzounds and I'll definitely continue to shop here.                
sometimes I have trouble getting one sound louder than the other. I wonder where all the deleted music or mistakes go. I hope not in the hard drive. over all it is a keeper.I use it 3-5 times a week.And I play for hours when i use it. I run it through a mustang 3 so i look for the clean channels.                
It didn't come with anything,but software, which is ok for the price. the auto looper comes in handy, and it takes a little time to get a true loop with no spaces. All and all i think boss did a good job.  everything is good and up to pare.                
It has a good sound. I run my cry baby wa wa pedel and my boss distortion peddel throught it. It is a no brainer to use, just read the manual and you will be fine.                
It is built like a tank I don't use a backup. Take your time and learn the in's and outs. I still wonder where the deleted mistakes go because sometimes i make a lot of them when i cant get something right. But so far so good. I have owned it since june 2011.                
I think it is a good price. worth every penny.                
no so far i have not had a problem with it                
I think it has great sex appeal. It makes me a better guitar player on my leads. It is great looking and i like the color and the way it lights up. It is a A plus in my book. GET ONE.                
I will use this for a long time. I will always have good words about this product. I will not bad mouth other products. I had a few loopers and I didn't like them. But fell in love with this one.                 
I'm a bassist in a rock band but also a proficient keyboardist.  When I'm playing in my rock band I hate having to lug my keyboard gear for only a few songs we do that require some keyboard lines.  This pedal was the answer!  I simply sampled and saved the required lines.  Now all I have to bring is this pedal and by choosing the correct sample number I simply press the foot pedal on the required parts and voila'!  I have keyboard lines.  Excellent sample reproduction and works flawlessly.  My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a power adapter.  Batteries work fine but batteries die.  So I'll be getting an adapter.  Otherwise, another solid product from Boss!                  
This Boss looper has excellent sound quality. Nice to have individual faders for each loop.                 
Many features for the money. I know there are those to lament the lack of MIDI (as do I). And the effects included are pretty much useless for my needs. I don't like having the two pedal contraption hanging off to increase/decrease the loop. Why not just have a dedicated switch(es)?
Also, NO POWER ADAPTER! Why do I have to spend $24.95 for a power adapter? Plus, the older power adapters don't appear to work with this unit.                
A few of the functions are tricky to understand (the two separate tracks for ex.).                 
Appears to be rock-solid like all Boss products.                
I guess it is a pretty good value as the Boomerang III is $469.00.                
No idea.                
N/A                
Nice looper. I've had them all over the years. For approx. $300, you can't gp wrong.                
To begin I love this pedal. It reminds me of a digitech I had back years ago. This pedal has a long duration of play back though, you can play back a whole song if you want. Not to mention the effects you can put to what your looping. My only issue is the ease of use, the double click of the pedal while trying to keep the rhythm goin. I do recommend this pedal and for the price it can't be beat this one has two tracks compared to the other boss which is only one.                
Great loop station. Works great, and you can put together some great stuff.,ZOUNDS is a great online music store, play as you pay is a great service. Will highly recommend ZZOUNDS.                
It does not color your tone at all. Whatever comes in is what goes out. The only down fall I've found is when playing back a loop and playing over it it's a little tricky to mix them properly when your using one amp. I use two amps and it sounds awesome.                
The most useful feature about it is being able to create a loop using reason or fruity loops and store into the pedal. I can create a backing track for each song on the set list, store it and play it back live. You can also store a file like that then overdub a rhythm live and your free to play lead over that. The least usefull feature for me are the built in effects. I do all that before the rc-30.                
To get the full awesomeness from this pedal and do it with quality results is an involved process. It's not plug and play, but I like that.                
Built like a tank.                
A great value! It may seem pricey but for what it allows you to do its well worth it. I bought this pedal and now I play keys, synth, all kinds of electronic stuff, rhythm and lead guitar and I do it all without ever taking my hands off of my guitar.                
I have not needed to contact customer support.                
Its sexy. Also everybody I know wants one. If you have it your the man. If you use it with skill your even more the man.                
I love it!!!                
Its a great thing to have for practice at home or jamming with others. There's so much recording time on each slot, you'll never run out of time. And the usb port, auxillery plug, and mic port make it THAT much better. The only problems that I do have, is that when using batteries they die quickly (about 3-5 days depending on usage) but that's why they have the AC adaptor; also it only has 10 drum patterns, more would be better.                 
There was no loss of signal when switching between the station and my other effects rig the sound is clear                 
Call me old school but I like having an on/off knob or switch  instead of an input jack to turn the unit on/off plus the risk of loosing data when pulling a jack when in a mode is scary otherwise it is well organized                
Took me a while to "learn how to record and overdub" along with the rhythm track but once I got its been a lot of fun                 
Well made as usual  with all of the boss line of products                 
Great for the money                 
Have not needed it yet don't expect too                
Have one                 
Hope to have this box for a long time it's a ton of fun . Never had so much fun playing with myself                
Great stereo loop  that is easy to use and allows the artist maximum flexibility.                
I am not experienced with looping gadgets or other similar devices; this is a new part of music for me. My experience so far is that the sound is good on one or 2 layers or loops. After several layers it starts to sound 'digitized' which is too bad, because that's when it gets really fun.                
I chose this model for the XLR input and the large memory capacity.                
It is very intuitive to use ... except the 'save' function. It is easy to hit the wrong button and erase something.                
The buttons are solid. The pedals are solid. It is sturdy and well assembled.                
It was a good value which is why I chose this model as compared to competing models and brands.                
not needed yet ...                
A practical addition and a nice introduction to effects for processing acoustic sound.                
I like that it is a quick and simple way to record myself for learning new tunes and arrangements.                
It's a little tricky to get the hang of it, but once you get timing down this pedal can really help you improve and impress on many levels.                
i have bought almost every looper available in the last year or so. several of them were very nice. each had strong points and weak points.
 the boss rc 300 is as close to my dream looper as i can get at this point in time.
 it is VERY simple to use. i've read that some folks have had skips at the end of their loops and can tell you, that is an operator problem. all looping requires something from the operator even when quantize is working. my loops are seamless and have great sound quality.
i use this looper live, on the street along with a boss me-70 and roland qube street amp.
i run all off of a small booster battery and dc/ac inverter. i can play all day long and never run out of power. best of all, i have quality sound in a mobile rig.
i havent even scratched the surface of what the rc 300 can do. it is an amazing piece of equipment.
Excellent product for many, many applications. The BOSS RC 300 can be set up to function in a way that best compliments your needs no matter what you have in mind. For me, I found the phrase memory parameters easy to program for a variety of templates. The RC 300 manual is straight forward and very simple to follow. I set up a generic phrase memory template for constructing songs/instrumentals. Track 1, track 2 and track 3 are programmed to work out verse/chorus/bridge song formats. The modular style record/playback and overdub allows me to find the best sequence for a new song. I can record a verse, a chorus and bridge with the ability to re-record if the first take isn't satisfactory. In a nut shell, this loop station is a real time tracking/overdub and mix session with the option of saving each project to a phrase memory. This phrase memory can be named in the RC 300 and then exported to a computer for future use as well as additional tweaks. I could go on forever writing about the RC 300 but choose to stop here. If you can think it then the RC 300 can make it happen. Another solid, complex yet user friendly noise toy from the BOSS team. Well done BOSS and thanks for making the creative process that much more enjoyable. A+++, get this loop station and be amazed.                
This is a great tool and a must for any serious guitar player. It will greatly improve your playing and song writing skills.                
Yeah this is everything I was expecting it to be. Been checking it out for a few months and finally pulled the trigger and got it. Glad I did. There are a few really good videos on YouTube about how to dig in and customize, which are more helpful than the manual or Boss videos - but the tutorials are out there and will help. It's a bit daunting otherwise to jump right into, so make sure you get familiar with those videos. I've only scratched the surface on what this can do, but as far as quality, it's solid. Very sturdy, seems like it'll last a long time. Hoping to put a live show together, as it's getting harder and harder to get guys to commit to a consistent band.                 
Although I am still getting used to all of the tricks and techniques, the RC-300 was pretty easy to get started with. If you take the time to understand the options for each loop, then you'll avoid having the "gap" issues where the loops don't align...seriously, it's not that hard. The one disappointing thing is the expression pedal...it seems to be an all or nothing proposition at times, and it will power-up in the of position when it's off, and sometime when you go from max to min, it doesn't catch the "off" position, and just keeps affecting the audio. A quick wiggle of the pedal will usually fix it, but it shouldn't happen at all IMO.                
There is a learning curve, but don't be discouraged.  This pedal creates soooo many possibilities for a solo act like me.  I am in love it.  I would suggest investing in an external footswitch or two, as many important features essential to live performance are not readily available on the fly.                
The fasted way any guitarist can learn to solo over back tracks. You can easily load up a cd, back track or what ever recording and blend your own sound on top. Instant band to back you and very simple to use. The effects on board are also great no peddles needed. Hooks up to any one of my many amps with ease.                
The RC-300 is more than just a pedal, it's the future of music in ways that we are yet to understand and experience. I'm very glad I bought it. I'm willing to bet money, in the future, we will see people doing stuff with "hardware" like this that we have never seen before. the RC-300 is the first step to a completely new approach on music, and I'm proud to say I'm one of the first to experience that. but I must admit, this product doesn't seem like the type of thing a guitar or bass player would use, it's definitely an instrument all it's own, so even though I give it a 10 for recommendation, I don't necessarily recommend it for bands as much as I recommend it for electronic musicians.                
This unit, like the old RC50 still has a momentary delay which makes it very difficult to use in live performances.  Boss is impossible to deal with; despite many kindly worded requests for support, it has become obvious that Boss could care less about individual consumers.                 
The Boss RC-505 packs in a lot of features for being marketed as "just a looper". It's really closer to a robust digital recorder or workstation than a pedal type looper. 
I purchased this to take the live recording/ looping load off of the back of my Octatrack, which in comparison has a very limited amount of recording, and most importantly, over-dubbing time. 
The RC-505 has over 3 hours of recording time, which is more than enough for most purposes. You can save all of the recordings, live while the tracks are still in playback mode. This is a huge plus if you want to take any awesome moments from your live performance back to the studio. 
Each of the 5 tracks can have their own recording length, up to 999 bars! All tracks are tempo synced perfectly and there are many options to customize how each track syncs and interacts when the previous recorded tracks. 
The fx section goes beyond what you normally get out of the built in fx in a piece of gear like this. In each fx section you have 3 fx slots that you can switch between in real time with out any hiccups or unwanted glitches. One of things that I was very happy with is that each fx slot retains the setting for all the fx on the list, so you can have 3 of the same fx set to each slot with different values, allowing you to easily "play" the fx. This is really awesome with things like delays, beat repeats and the transpose fx. Also, you get TWO of these fx sections, one for incoming audio and one for recorded audio. The only down side that I can see with the fx is that the dedicated fx knob is hardwired to one parameter per fx. This is not that big of a deal, as soon as you select an fx, the menu for send fx will come in to focus and the rest of the parameters are just 2 to 4 button presses away, allowing you to use the main data entry knob for the selected parameter.   
The midi sync on this unit is also rock solid. While researching loopers I found that midi sync is largely over looked or poorly implemented in most loopers. I have had no issue syncing the RC-505 to any of my hardware or software. When working with sequencers, you can even have the sampling start on beat, quantizing to the "one"  and easily put together group of on time rhythmic phases. 
I have not dived in to the built in rhythms, but they sound great and there are a wide variety of time signatures and styles to choose from. 
Over all, you can tell that a lot of thought was put in to making this unit playable and easy to use. From the great fx sections and versatile track editing, to how the menus are layed out, you will be able to easily and quickly integrate the RC-505 in to your live rig or studio recording set up.
I would recommend this product to anyone who who needs a good hands on looper or backing track player.                  
Moved up from a floor model (RC-3) and am amazed with this machine.   The five definable tracks (one-shot, loop) allow a lot of creative room - that I am yet to fully explore.  Switches, knobs, faders and buttons are all high quality and seem made for regular use.  I've used it almost daily since arrival with no failures of any kind.  
The onboard effects are great....enough to fully mimic famous beatboxers (dub fx, Reggie, etc) without an additional pedal.  My bass effect pedal (Zoom B1X) delivers no more than what is available in the onboard effect list, and the RC-505 has much higher sound quality than my previous efforts using a XLR converter and traditional effect pedal.  It's three types of inputs make for lots of multi-instrument fun that was previously unavailable in my smaller RC-3.    
It would be five stars for "perfect" only if a full function foot pedal was available, and if the case were a little more armored (I'm terrified of dropping it).  The Boss FS6 pedal is great but might hold back the machines full potential for those who play with two hands.  Also....Don't drop it.....ever.
Otherwise it is one of my favorite "instruments" and I highly recommend this product to those who seek the high power of an Ableton loop setup in a hardware package.
There's nothing like hardware for the stage!    
We previously owned the RC-300 which is not really designed for vocalists so this loop station is the bomb compared to the one we used before! It's lighter and smaller which is perfect for us, since we travel a lot and need to be carrying it around with us to perform all over the world.                
This is a really fun loop station with some nice basic features and some surprising flaws given its price point. You can only use one input FX, and one track FX at a time, despite there being 3 FX buttons for each. So as an effects processer for your loops it's really limited. You also can't ReSample any of the loops to take advantage of extra effects either. There is no BPM sync for the different delay effects, that was disappointing. The build quality is also really cheap, I would worry about this thing in the long haul. That beng said the basic looping features are really fun and intuitive, but for $500, I couldn't justify keeping this thing.                
I absolutely LOVE it. The looping effect with five tracks is amazing. This little thing can do quite a lot & it's fun. Perfect for a choir nerd, I'm a one woman choir!                
Great product!  I do so much with this thing.  It has expanded my musical abitilites to say the least.  I would definitely recommend this product to any one that plays an instrument.                
I loved this pedal from the start. it was everything i was looking for in my DUB. Ive heard people say thats its not the best for guitar but it works well with other pedals. I found that putting a nice phaser after it seems to help with a dynamic whoosh. Reggae lovers should have one.                
Awsome to use by hand for an outboard delay. i take it to everyone of my shows. some guys wont let me do sound unless i have it. The intensity knob is what i wanted it for. Then having the 12 mode knob settings is even more dynamic. I wish i had two of them. The tap tempo helps too for quick applications.                
It took me a while to get used to, but now i can use it with my eyes closed. I think having a small pedal or button to oscilate it would be cool. i just havent found one for myself yet. I almost wish it had a seperate out for the reverb. I like the sound it gives when its overdriven, very sonar-ish. Its application is great for keyboards. I like that the manual gives settings for classic sounds.                
I love the way this thing looks. It not only sounds cool, but looks vintage for those with that taste. Its very strong, and heavy. I love heavy equipment because theyre like old cars, it shows how good of a product it is. I really wish i knew how to make one so i could make my own.                
It's a good price for someone who really uses it like myself, but i dont think it should properly be priced above 200$.                
I havent had to deal with them directly, but im sure a company that makes a product like this would be good in all services.                
Its not comparibal to any other delay or echo. i believe its the best thing since the actual head unit itself. I carry it and play it like its my instrument, cause it is.                
Ill keep it till it breaks, i wish there was a matching phaser and spring reverb, but it could ude more helpfull style modes. Like 5 differnt tempo modes and 7 differnt styles or something. but its still a beautiful thing.                
Being my first delay pedal I can't compare it to others however it doesn't suck any of my tone. It doesn't even sound digital, cold, or sterile to me. Doesn't color my amps tone either. Make sure you use this in the effects loop however it does sound okay through the front end up my gain channel.                 
From what I can tell this has all the features of the original RE201 but in a compact stompbox.                 
This is the first pedal I've bought that the manufacturer actually provided sample settings in the manual.On the underside of the pedal has a diagram of how the different modes include which tape head sound. I found my favorite delay sound in a few minutes and now I feel like David Gilmour with this thing on.                  
It's a Boss pedal. I'll never have reliability issues. Feels nice and heavy too.                
This pedal is just like it's analog predecessor and those units are very costly on the used market. My friends RE501 tape echo/chorus unit is worth a pretty penny but my pedal does something his unit can't do and that is my pedal actually works. Boss could charge up to twice the price and still sell these.                
Being a Boss pedal I'm sure the manufacturer support is great too.                 
It does have a cool name "space echo". Sounds like something a martian left behind on our planet. It even smiles and winks at you. In fact maybe it's a space robot from another galaxy!                 
I finally broke down and decided to buy a delay pedal. At first I just wanted an MXR Carbon Copy but after selling my second amp and having extra money I decided  without hesitation to buy the RE20. I'm not going to say this is the best delay pedal on the market but it does an excellent tape delay sound for what it's worth. I really like the layout and the ability to mix tape heads and reverb. It doesn't take long at all to find a good setting either. I can't wait to use this with two amps either. I'll probably pick up the MXR someday but I won't need to.                 
havent dealt with them.                
This has taken the place of my Carbon Copy, very tweakable and sounds amazing.Also a quick shout out to Russell in Customer service,That guy goes way above and beyond for the Customer!!! Thanks Russesll!!!!                
I am a great fan of the  echo sound I am not into reverb which this unit also has to perfection.
there is nothing out there that matches this  echo sound . I use it solely for my vocals. i have never been complimented so much on my vocals since I purchased this unit. its just the best sound you could want to have and I entertain live.you can take these comments to the bank.  
a bonus would be to have 2 or three mic inputs   thank you

VERY close approximation of the old Space Echo.  Tone controls allow for nice colour adjustment of the delay sound.
Reverb isn't my favourite effect.  But this one is at least usable.  Doesn't sound springy or fake.  
Seems to be a bit more sensitive to the gain of the input - especially between the difference of clean vs. distorted qualities.  The sound is good for both.  But I have to either set it for one character or the other; or try to find a useful compromise between them.  Not perfect for both.  
The real Space echos didn't seem to do that near as much as this digital version.
But again, a really nice modern rendition of a classic.  
Has some features that are kind of cool.  But some are just useless gimicks.  
The "tape speed" indicator is cute for the first 30 seconds.  But after that, it's just a battery waster.  Doesn't really serve any useful purpose.
But all of the controls do just what they are supposed to.  
The "oscillation" effect doesn't really seem to have a real use.  (1) Since the unit sits on the floor, it would be kind of silly to have to bend down just to do some non-musical effect.  With a real tape echo, you could just reach back and do it, put the speed knob back where you want it, and it's over.  
Here; even if you did want to look dorky and squat down just for that one silly thing, just putting the knob back doesn't take it out of that mode.  Ah, the price of digital.                
If one reads the names on the knobs, it shouldn't be tough at all.  The only one that will take some figuring is the main settings knob.  And a quick read of the manual (or the bottom of the unit) and that gets cleared up straight away.
If you're used to dialing in a specific number on your digital readout, best get over that quick.  Here, your ear is the only gauge of the delay tempo that will be of any use.  It's old-school, but it works great if you just learn to work with the device instead of insisting that the device pander to you.                
Seems built lots stronger than I was anticipating.  Heavier than it looks.  Reckon I could chock the wheels of my car, should I need to change a tire, in a pinch and still expect it would sound just fine at the next gig.                  
It could have been a little less expensive.  But I'm happy I have it.  Even for what I paid for it.                  
N.A.                
Very cool.  
For folks who want GUITAR sounding effects, and/or a more vintage quality to their tone, this is a hot choice.  Even better that the panel looks just like a miniature version of the 201.  Kinda takes me back a bit every time I look down.                
A good purchase.  A happy customer.  I still like the tone of my rig even after adding this one to the chain.  I worthy addition to my music.                
I just got my Space Echo today. I experimented with it for a good 4 hours straight. It's sound is wonderful it does not color or saturate the tone of your guitar at all. Theres also no hum. In my beginners set up (consisting of a Ibanez Tube Screamer and a Boss Phase Shifter) there was a lot of noise and such. When i hooked up and turned on the Space Echo it actually took some of the noise out, not all of it, but a noticable amount. I thought that was very interesting, because i read a couple reviews saying you can hear the digital processing going on in the Space Echo. I dont hear that at all. It's rather silent i think. Also, if anything it made my guitar sound more...how do i say...clear. I dont really know how to explain it, but it makes my guitar sound better. Even just having it on but the settings turned off/all the way down. It just creates a kind of ambience behind my tone that sounds wonderful.                
The features are great. 12 reverb/echo/repeat effects plus the option to alter the repeat rate, the echo volume, the intensity, input volume, and a couple other things i forget at the moment. Theres one little feature i find quite interesting that i didn't know this could do because it's never talked about, but the Twist function is very interesting. You hold down the tap tempo pedal and it starts oscilating and making a sort of "SWOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHH" sound, it sounded like that old sound effect from a kids cartoon where the characters are in space and they like fly through a worm hole or something. Very cool. The space echo also has the ability to store a preset in the optional expression pedal. You can program the expression pedal to control the repeat rate, the intensity, the volume, or the twist. And the space echo itself can be preset to either use the standard delay times, or the longer delay times (double the standard times basically). Theres also one setting on it, i forgot exactly how i had my knobs, but it basically became a looper. Im pretty sure it was one of the repeat settings, with the repeat rate and intensity turned all the way up (not sure though) but when i played something, it'd repeat, and never stop. It was functioning as a loop pedal too. If i find the setting again i will post it somewhere.                
This thing is incredibly simple to use. The knobs are pretty self explanitory. The only thing that gets Ease of Use an 8 is that it's tough to get how they all effect each other. Also some of the features that aren't really known, such as the Twist, and storing presets (kind of) was a little difficult for me to get at first, but a quick read through the 20 page or so manual was all that was needed to understand it all, a second or third read through might be necessary for people who like to follow the book, but other wise, you should just experiment with the settings and figure it out yourself. Its a lot more fun that way too.                
This is one of the most well-built pedals i've ever seen. When i picked it up, it felt like a brick. The manual says to be careful with it, not to drop it and all that, this thing is a freakin tank. Still take care of it though, but if i drop it like once i wouldnt be too worried. Boss is known for their well built pedals.                
Took me 4 months to save up the 250 for this thing. I think it was worth it, the money it'd take to get other pedals that'd do the same thing is a lot more then this is worth. I think it was worth every penny.                
I've only had it for a day, so i haven't really needed Customer Support. I've heard they are great though.                
Black and green made me think of "What if the Green Lantern played guitar?" This would be his main pedal. It's pretty hot.                
This is by far the best thing i've bought other than my guitar. The Space Echo adds depth and ambience to my sound, something i've been looking for for a while. I love this thing, and will treat it like a son. The sound is amazing, the features are unique and mysterious even. Theres nothing bad for me to say about this thing.                
Great vintage tape echo simulation. Perfect for playing psych, kraut & prog rock. Has a unique, ragged, lost in space feel that I haven't found in any other delay. Be sure you want this sound, though it is really tweakable so I suppose more modern sounds could be coaxed out of it. I am using it with keyboards in a band situation and sounds great in that situation as well as with guitar. The only thing I don't like is there is a slight treble cut when activated, but not terrible considering.                
Plenty of tweakability, more so than others. I wish it came with an adapter, at the price it should. I am running the 6 AA batteries and they claim 36 hours which is pretty good for this hefty delay.                 
Really easy to operate. Takes some time getting adjusted to the different tape head settings. A little goes a long way with this. At loud volumes it is easy to coax into oscillated feedback.                 
I haven't used Boss pedals before, but as far as I know they are built to last. Seems very sturdy.                 
I wish it were cheaper, but it has the sound I want and need, so that satisfaction for me is worth the extra cost.                
i've owned this pedal for over a year now and it's never let me down. the sounds you can get are incredible. there's nothing quite like having a leslie at your feet. next to buying a 122 or a 147 it's the best sounding rotary emulator i've tried or heard. i owned a hammond XK-2 and the leslie sound didn't even start to compare.                
everything you need to define your sound is on this pedal, it's got all the knobs for rise time, balance and overdrive. there's even a switch to change the overdrive from guitar or keyboard. awesome. just like any boss pedal, it doesn't come with an adapter. but that's how boss is.                
plug and play. sounds great with everything at 12 o'clock. but if you're into customizing your sound, it's incredibly easy to do. everything is right at your fingertips. i keep mine on top of my keyboard and just adjust the sounds as i go. no programmable settings, just knobs.                 
just like most boss pedals it's built like a tank, like i said, i've had mine for just over a year and nothing has broken and it always sounds like the first time i played it.                
for what this pedal does, it's worth it. i mean..if you're an organist in jazz, rock, blues, etc you need a leslie or a simulator. this is the kind of pedal you'll have on all the time, every time you play. so when you think of it that way..250 isn't a lot to pay                
for me, i wanted a leslie, but this thing gives you all the tones with out having to buy a truck to cart a cabinet around. that makes it pretty desirable don't you think?                 
i don't think i'll get another rotary pedal. if this one dies (which it shows no signs of doing) i'd buy another one. obviously, it isn't a 122 or a 147, but for the size and price worth every penny.                 
Very impressive, expressive, and tuned for recording and stage. I have not found a keyboard with a Leslie effect at any price that can match the realism this pedal emulates. I no longer lug my Motion Sound around to gigs. You are no longer restricted to miking a rotor to increase volume. Just use a larger amp! No quality loss.                 
You can read about that elsewhere, but in real world use. Rotation speed, grunge, stereo! It's all there. Works well on organ and electric piano. If you forget your adapter (sold seperately) it runs on battery. Nice touch. Haven't changed batteries in 4 months. Heavy pedal so it won't slide away. Stomp worthy pedals.                
It takes a bit of fiddling but each knob returns definite audible changes so very soon you understand which knob does what. Only difficulty is having to reach down to your feet for adjustments. If only there were an extension with the controls that you could place on your keyboard.                
Built like a tank. Don't drop it. You'll break the floor.                
Can't knock the product but it is pricey.                
Dunno.                
Ummm. It stays below my shoe. The psych light's cool.                
Portability, sound quality, reliability, durability. Makes pretty much any keyboard sound like a Hammond. What's that worth to ya?                
Very hard to find but I did. I haven't even begun to touch the surface of what the RT-20 will do. But there is no doubt. It's awesome!                
So much more than I expected.                
A bit of a learning curve for me but I don't have a whole lot of time to put into it.                
Very nice.                
You're getting what you pay for.                
Rolandus.co was helpful with a couple of questions.                
It is fun to use in a dark room but that's not really all that important.                
This is a keeper. It isn't going anywhere.                
Clear and very realistic lesly sound.                
Once you get the foot pedal,  the sky`s the limit                
Simple as they come                
Solid as a rock                
I think that all musical equipment is much too expensive.                
I would imagine that it would be great but I`ve never needed it.                
I can`t get over how closely this pedal resembles an actual Lesly.  If it`s a Lesly sound that you want,  this is exactly what you need and in my experience,20 years,  it`s the best product of it`s type on the market.                
Absolutely one of the best sounding pedal Reverbs Ive used to date. Ive used Strymon, Neunaber, TC Electronic, Electro Harmonix, Eventide, DigTech/Lexicon and a few others.  They all have their tone and if it works for you great.  If you want something with more dimension and realism give the RV 500 a listen. The Plate & Hall Reverb are fantastic on nylon strings.  Lots of tweaking possibilities. Its very easy to eq the low and high trails and tone.  Right out of the box and on my Pedalboard its usable.  The ability to pull off my pedal-board and use with batteries is s plus for my use at gigs with no ac.  Many of the good reverb pedals on the market dont have this option. Its 32bit 96k sampling is an industry high. Im liking it so far. Its very smooth and non grainy. I dont care for reverb of any type when theres a grainy trail and sounds transistorized processed. I have this setup for my main Gig Rig. From the Guitars with LR Baggs Dual Source or Fishman Presus Blend.  Line in (TR)or Wireless (SaturnA/B Switcher) with Line 6 G30 to a Grace Design AliX, Dddaro Tuner, Boss RV500, TC Ditto Looper.                
The only reason I decided to get this pedal was for the new shimmer mode because i wanted to add more to swells. The Shimmer blends beautifully when dialed correctly or it will sound really sharp-ish. The dynamic mode is really interesting cause it automatically adjust to the style you play (soft or hard picking) the delay mode is more to be desired but i guess it could get you by if you don't have one. It's no true bypass so it does color your tone a hint if you don't run it through a effects loop. If you use a battery, it will mute everything before it if it dies. This is a really versatile reverb pedal and is perfect for its time.                
This is a fantastic reverb pedal. In this day and age with soooo many boutique pedal makers offering such a variety of options it's easy to think of BOSS as the "boring industry standard"  Don't do that. 
I needed something specifically for warm deep pad sounds in church worship playing. My budget is out of the realm of a blue sky/big sky/eventide, but this thing can do exactly what I need. I use the shimmer and modulate settings primarily but this is a complex and big sounding reverb in any of the settings. When using shimmer I turn the tone to the left to get the sound I need. Turned the right I find that the higher octave algorithms sound too metallic & digital. 
I'm super happy with my purchase.                
I equate overdrives like wasabi or cayenne pepper...its got no real flavor of its own until added on top of something. Although, id say the sd 1 adds a nice high mid to your tone. Lots of extra grit on tap too..im sure out there would be curious to know that. Just remember..its overdrive, not distotion. Overdrives are transparent and sit on top of a sound, thus if you play clean channels with an od on, youll still hear the clean signal clucking under it. a distortion is for masking or creating a channel. If you play a clean channel then kick on a distortion, you basically just created a dirty channel.                
Just perfect actually                
a caveman can do it                
Its a boss...their stuff has always seen the worst and managed to keep working.                 
Considering how many idiots will spend 200 and up for something as simple and plain as an od, this is an absolute steal. It does exactly what an overdrive is meant to do. Od pedals have no business in the boutique world.its like people trying to make a gourmet french fry and charging a premium for it. at the end of the day, its still a classless french fry. An od is still an od.                
Never needed it                
Lets say this again...its just an overdrive.  It has no character on its own. Its sole purpose is simply pushing an amp                
all guitarists need an od at some point. So its nothing special, and these types of pedals arent supposed to be. Its job is usually done well no matter how much you spend.                 
I liked the overall sound a lot. The only real con is that, depending on the level, there is a high amount of feedback from the amp, though this could be worked on.                
The knobs are relatively easy to understand. High quality metal framework and no-slip rubber.                
Small, fits on most pedalboards (I have a PB1000) and, as aforementioned, the knobs are simple enough.                
You could throw this thing out of a moving car and it will probably still work.                
Besides on zZounds, I have never seen this pedal under $45-50. I think it is better to get this than to give in to a cheap pedal or maybe to even wait for a more expensive pedal.                
zZounds.com was accurate in the shipping progress, and Boss was right to boast about its quality and features.                
It is very good-looking, unlike the EHX Big Muffs that you basically have to dedicate space to -- the rubber is no-peel, and the metal frame and construction are great.                
This is a very nice pedal; it delivers hi-fidelity sounds to your amp. If anything, it has a bit of feedback and, if not kept up, isa bit squeaky when pressed.                
I would give this a 10, but if you crank the drive you can sometimes get a little hum. Other than that this pedal is INSANE! You can get a clean, boosted sound with this or you can get a really dirty grunge sound. (Oh yeah, and everything in between!) Minus the minor hum, you almost always get an incredibly crisp sound. It's fantastic!                
It's got a LEVEL, TONE, and DRIVE knob. That's really all you need for this. Adjust the DRIVE to crank the intensity and the TONE to decide whether you want to play the highs or the lows.                
It's really easy to use. You can read the manual, which is helpful. But I really just enjoyed opening it, sitting down with it, and messing with all the knobs. Turning them this way and that, I was able to get the sounds that I desired with little or no trouble at all.                
This is a BOSS pedal. These things wouldn't break if we had a nuclear war. You don't have to worry about it breaking, IT WON'T. Just be sure to only the right type of power supply (9V battery or BOSS AC jack). Mine came with the AC power supply free.                
$50 bucks for an overdrive pedal isn't bad at all. You really get what you paid for.                
Haven't had to deal with them and I don't anticipate I will have to.                
I don't really care what it looks like, but I wanted it pretty badly. I had listened to demos of it and knew it was what I was looking for.                
I probably won't replace it. Even if I become a professional musician, I don't think I'll ever have to replace this pedal (or want to for that matter).                
Very pleased with the sound. I lean more towards rock sounds - so my tone and drive are always at 3 o'clock - works well with my strat and hollowbody - especially with the humbuckers on a hollow and single-coils. Great sound.                   
The most useful feature - ONE single tone knob! No fiddling with any High/Low knobs - one tone knob is already plenty                
Very user-friendly                
Solid. Although the paint kinda chips off easily in some places.                
Affordable. Nicely priced.                
No problems so far - don't expect any anytime soon.                
Based on the sound, I'd say this is one great overdrive pedal - would like a Blues Driver to pair with this, though.                
Great for what I need and what I do                
A well made good solid OD pedal for the money but not what I was looking for. I found it hard to dial in my tone. The SD1 had a little to much edge for me as I was looking for a warmer, smoother OD and ultimately  exchanged it for a TS9 tube screamer which I'm very happy with.                
The SD-1 is a controversial pedal in the sense that most people buy it for the wrong reasons. I myself fell into that catagory once upon a time. I would read in my favorite guitar mags about my heroes using it in their setup. You know, guys like Zakk Wylde and Eddie Van Halen who are world renown for great tone have this same yellow box on their pedalboards, so I thought this is the key to achieving great tone. This wasn't the case. The SD-1 on its own, with all the controls maxed, is not a high gain affair. So in that aspect I shelved the thing for years. As time went by though I changed my musical tastes a bit, now I lean more towards the classic country sounds of the late 60's, guitarists like Don Rich and Roy Nichols and modern day guys like Pete Anderson and Marty Stuart. Now suddenly I find this pedal to be the cream of the crop. With the drive set at around 9 o clock or less it adds the right amount of grit to a clean Fender Tube amp. Low end licks stand out in the mix much better and it adds a good amount of sustain and clarity for pedal steel licks as well. If rockabilly and roadhouse blues are your thing or if you are looking for a touch of natural sounding overdrive this is the pedal for you. Barn burners need to pass this on by though. No high gain here.                
I give it a nine because it is simple, not a lot of features, just the right ones.                
I have owned it 10 years without any worries, can't say that about the rest of my equipment.                
Great tone at half the price of Ibanez TS9. Why shell out the dough? Save it for strings.                
Never had to deal with the company but I have heard good things.                
The all metal case is the most appealing. I have owned plastic pedals that have basically been destroyed by use or accidents. Never let the drummer help you load your equipment!                
Like I said earlier, most people buy the SD-1 for all the wrong reasons. If you want high gain distortion pass this up, otherwise you will submit a report of unsatisfaction. If you want to boost your amp a little without over the top gain look no further. I will also mention that this isn't a cure for lacking tone. You need to establish a decent tone without the pedal first, then the SD-1 will accentuate that. I have tried this pedal on solidstate amps with disappointing results,works best with tube amps, in my opinion anyway.                
Excellent sound. Very useful like smooth overdrive or light distortion. Gives an increase in the medium frequencies. The only drawback of this pedal is that it sucks part of the low end response.
Good if you want to increase the guitar volume for solos.                
Everything you need is there.                
Only 3 knobs...                
BOSS: Best pedal construction.                
Excelent sound for the money.                
Never had to contact BOSS.                
Perfect.                
Excelent.                
It's an overdrive, a good one. Pretty straight-forward, not hard to figure out. Whatever amp your running, this pedal is your upper-cut.                
I originally came into my local music store two/three weeks agolooking for the SD1 - after buying Digitech's Bad Monkey, returning it and finding the SD1 newly in stock, I quickly returned the bad monkey and scooped it up - and how glad was I! The tone is miles ahead of the shrilly digital sound of the Digi overdrive - whereas three simple knobs can make such a difference. It took a few days of tweaking and experimentation, but just recently I dialed in the perfect tone on my Crate Flexwave 120FW - and the sound I get when I stomp the boss is so pleasing I'm scared to touch the solo knobs! Overall, with a little tweaking, this pedal has enough.                
This pedal lacks features for one reason: it doesn't need alot of features to do its job. I didn't find this as a displeasing at all, but rather better. I gave it a 7 as it's not a completely flashy pedal. I don't wish it had anything more.                
With three knobs, how could you go wrong? My justification for buying this pedal was I didn't really want to be swooned to spend $100 dollars on a Tubescreamer when that in itself could buy a new pickup if need be.  For $50 and less in some places (in my case, as it was $45), and with Boss, I knew I had to atleast check it out. All in all, you don't have to be a good guitarist to get any type of moderate distortion you want.                
I love Boss pedals after I first bought the MD2 - which later turned out to be not so amazing after I discovered palm muting sounded awful on it - but after my slight experience with the way it was built like a tank, I expected no less, and no less were my expectations correct. It feels rock solid, the dials have a very unique quality to them, the finish & color is very recognizable (and that's a Boss thing; and I love it), and the sound, last but certainly not least, is better than my amp's overdrive channel in that is sounds very deep, resonant and natural. Suffice to say, it's very pleasing to have the SD1 in my loop.                
I find it extremely - amazingly - worth the price at any retailer. The price I paid was modest and still kept close to the retail value, and I would pay just about anything close if I had to buy it again.                
I have never dealt with Boss at all, but the stamp of approval on its' 5 year warranty on the box practically speaks for itself in matters of support.                
If I didn't have this pedal I would be working myself to death trying to get money for pickups, then I might decide they don't make my guitar sound any better and I go out in search of a pedal, but I can't because I'm broke as I just bought new pickups. Needless to say, I now thrive on this pedal simply because it gave me an amazing shortcut in my tone, altogether with the price I paid for it, I feel like I got my money's worth, and plenty more than that.                 
I have never tried another overdrive (beside the Bad Monkey); and although this is no original vintage TS808 or TS9, I'll give it a 9 because it isn't the best overdrive in the world. If I had to replace it, I wouldn't think of buying anything else unless I had to, and I could afford it. Because It feels like it could withstand nuclear war, this pedal isn't going anywhere out of my possession.                
This pedal sounds amazing. I'm using a crappy little 15w Fender Frontman 15G amp, but I can adjust my SD-1 pedal to get as decent sound as I can from the amp. I have heard this pedal on larger amps, and speaker cabs, and its simply phenomenal!                  
When I bought the pedal it was just the pedal, I had to buy the jumper cables and what not. It came with a 9v battery in it, but the battery didnt have much charge. Once I got the PSA adaptor I didnt have to worry about batteries just yet. 
The pedal is stomp-proof. When I'm shredding, or rocking a rhythm, this box handles my weight at about 200lbs. I would advice standing on the thing, but me stomping on it is quite enough.                
Quite simple. 3 knobs, and a pedal. I whack a chord or a note, and adjust the knobs to get the sound I want. darken the tone and up the drive, or about 50/50 on drive and level and get me a warm sound. 
The pedal came with a very simple instruction manual, and leaves room for exploration. I also forgot to say, since each pedal is color coded, it makes recognizing pedals all the easier. when your in the dark on the stage, or in broad daylight, its simple.                
As I said above, the quality is good, in both sound, and design. The only thing you really have to worry about are the conenctions sticking out of it that you might break.                 
Being priced at a price below 50 US dollars, it was a steal. good sound, for a good price. one of the better pedals for a low price.                 
I havent had to deal with the support yet. Hopefully i wont have to. So far so good.                 
Yellow, stands out, first pedal to stomp, and with the right kind of music, anything can be sexy. its small, and looks like a brick. no gawdy stomp knobs sticking out, and the sound knobs on it already are almost lower than the stomp pedal, so you dont have to worry about steping on one.                 
Nothing beats having an overdriven tube amp, but the Boss SD-1 pedal really makes the sound different, and better. When using a chip amp, it helps drive a cleaner sound.                 
Sounds very cool, but has a little bit to much high frequency                
No support needed. If broken, I'll buy a new one. Cost only $50.00                
A lot of control over the Overdrive... Tone level and drive what more do you need? and the most important part of the sound... its made by BOSS                
Simple and to the point... twist the nob and your set                
Come on? You hit it with yoour Foot and it turns on...                
Its BOSS... Well built, perfect for stage and im in a Punk Band!!!                
I picked it up for 38 Pounds stg and thats a steal $50? thats 25-30 Pounds                
Never Had To Deal Wiith Them...                
Im a fan of BOSS pedals for cosmetics durability reputation and most of all sound...                
Well its an add on not the last piece before success but well it covers youe overdrive i twin it with a custom distortion on a VOX AD30VT i have total Control                
Great Sound.  It can however suck a bit of the lower end.  This pedal has a smooth classic sound.                
Volume Tone Drive.
would be nice if you could boost some of the frequencies (namely the bass.)                
3 knobs, but a lot of combinations for sound.    Quite easy to use.                
I got this pedal used.  And then I beat the crap out of it.  This pedal might be indestructible.                
Great Value                
I haven't dealt with them about this pedal, but I did have ask Roland (Who owns boss) a couple questions about my 20+ year old JC-120 amp.  They got back to me right away.                
Looks like a Boss pedal.   Which if you know boss pedals, you would assume that it's a decent well built pedal.   It's like buying a hammer.  You know it's going to get the job done.                
This pedal has never failed me.  What it does it does well.  It has that classic sound, and can take a beating.  It isn't the right sound for all applications, but it does work for a good many.  I'd rather have this pedal than some others with much higher prices.                
excellent, the idle humming is barley noticebale                
none needed...its a pedal                
3 knobs, could it get easier? pedal goes down easy                
sturdy, everything is great                
cheappppp                
good deal                
everyone should have this, its a good base sound                
This is the best pedal you could ever own. It sounds so good! Put it into a high-powered amp and just let go! I have all the settings on the pedal to about 2 o'clock                
IT doesn't have a lot of features but it doesn't need many its an OVerdrive pedal and it is the best there is.                
It is a boss, it will still be around long after i'm gone.                
Wasn't very expensive at all. The technology isn't cutting edge but it doesn't need to be. This is a brilliant overdrive pedal. It lets you rock HUGE while given a lot of transparency so all the little details of your playing, what makes you, you, is still there. It isn't muddled up by the overdrive.                
never had to deal with them don't know.                
BUY IT! YOU WON"T REGRET IT.                
As i said before brilliant pedal, it wasn't alot of money and it sounds incredible!                
I have used this overdrive pedal for more than twenty years. This pedal allows you to take the original tone with on/off pedal pedal comparisons and increase the gain to the point that your amp will naturally follow.                
3 knobs, that is all. Each one is truly usable.                
Over twenty years of use without a single problem or "scratchy" pot...'nuff said!                
Value!!! I paid more for this pedal ($60 US) in the early 1980's. The industry has certainly changed!                
This pedal has a lot of good settings. If someone does not like this pedal, it is likely that they do not like their original tone. This pedal adds layers of great overdrive.
If you have a weak solid-state "bedroom amp", you may not like this pedal. If you want a distortion pedal that sustains tones for days, this pedal is not for you.
I got lucky over twenty years ago to find a pedal that does not "clamp"(compress) and merely "fuzz" like Electro Harmonix Big Muff, and not add notchy/cheap/feedback riddled tones like other offerings by Boss/MXR/DOD(Digitech).                
This pedal has little is integral of my sound. I use it with my 1974 all-tube Sunn Model T, and a Gibson electric guitar. The tone I shoot for is Black Sabbath/ Corrosion of Conformity/ Black Flag/ Down/ Down II.
I'm a 24 year guitar veteran. I use to gig on a semi-pro level and now I am just a hobbiest.  I was always against any sort of midi / guitar synth system. Then one day I got a wild hair up my arse and decided to buy the Boss SY-300. This is one of the best purchases I ever made! MIND BLOWN!! I liked this so much that not long after I bought this I ended up getting the Boss GP10 and the Roland GR55 guitar synths. These processors hooked up with head phones.....MIND BLOWN!!!!                
This unit is way more convenient than the type that requires a midi cable.  However, the sounds that it can produce are very limited and it does not really work well unless your using a clean channel without any distortion.  I am using a splitter so that the synth is is going to a clean amp with a volume pedal and my other amp has the typical overdrive tones.  This is the only way that I found it usable for playing out in a band.  It adds much texture and fullness but at a steep price,                
Sound was very clear, just not musically useful.                
You can edit, but extremely limited editing. The sounds were all canned and very little manipulation was allowed, so you are stuck with cheesy canned sound effects.                
Extremely limited, very menu intensive, not at all user intuitive.                
Built like the best paper weight ever made.                
It's equivalent to one of those novelty cheesy synth stomp boxes that winds up in a pawn shop for $125                
The company is obviously not going to allow you to have the same sounds on their expensive synthesizers in this box unless they can sell you special pickups and deal with tracking issues.                
Looks great, built a nice looking box, unfortunately it's a way over priced useless box.                
As a typical synthesizer, there are hundreds of patches, most are useful. In this situation, there are hundreds of patches and maybe 1 or 2 were usable. Just a bunch of sound effects you'd find on a movie soundtrack, nothing you could play single note scale or solo unless you just held a chord for 10 seconds waiting for the outcome of your sound. Such a bummer because you don't need a special pickup and there is no tracking issues, just no usable sounds. Epic fail Boss!                
I play mostly "Clean Traditional Jazz Guitar" using Chrome Flat wounds, few effects and seldom utilize distortion. My tone is very jazz box with just a touch of highs on the tone setting. As such, I was looking for a really clean, neutral echo device and found it.The Tera Echo creates beautiful ambient echo which seems to favor no particular frequency. It's just gorgeous and reminds me of a multi-room sized physical tank echo unit I once had the pleasure of experiencing at Sunset Recorders in LA when I was a punk kid during the 1960's. While it's normally very neutral, if I dig in, the unit creates an "after-sound echo" that resembles an explosive digital comb sweeping beautifully through the note or chord I played. Beyond my narrow usage, the I guTE-2 creates a multitude of beautiful effects which ought to turn on the creativity of any Guitar Player. I like it.man                
This thing sets the bar so damn high, that after using it you cant even see the bottom. It takes you on a journey through time and space. Its beyond an echo, delay, or reverb. It has a spatial envelope filter, that is unlike anything else. It will make any player sound better.                
Sound is very good overall.  Can get a nice variety of trem rate and depth.  I like the wave shaping also.                  
I like the features overall.  For the $, this seemed to have everything I had a need for.  Some of the Boss pedals aren't worth much, but this is one of their better effects pedals out there.  I'm not afraid to buy expensive gear, but I just couldn't see that much more value in the higher end boutique trem effects pedals.  I guess it's all about the sound you want.  I wanted a pedal version of the old-school vibrato channels on the fenders, and this does the trick nicely for me.                
Very straightforward and easy to use.                
Seems to be very high quality, as all Boss pedals are.  I've had some, under very heavy use, that are 8 years old, and still look barely used.                  
This is a nice value, mid-range tremelo pedal.  You can spend more on Boutique's, but unless you need a very specific sound, I find this pedal gives all most players would need in a tremelo.                  
Never needed to call support.  No issues.                
This is a no-nonsense straightforward tremelo pedal.  You can spend more for fancy looking, but I appreciate the functional layout and design.  Very consistent with all Boss pedals.                
This is a good, solid pedal, and in my opinion, all most players would ever need.                  
Very warm sounding tremolo. Slight volume drop when engaged but, honestly, it's not THAT noticeable.                  
Triange/square wave option is very useful. Depth knob doesn't really come into play until 12:00. Speed range is perfect. Won't go ring mod fast or crazy slow, but a wide enough range for normal use. Not true bypass but the buffer is fine, and sometimes a buffer is useful.                
Easy as pie. Three knobs and a stomp. Dialing in a good sound on this pedal is simple.                 
It's a Boss, it's not going to fall apart on you                
I went through a handful of tremolo pedals, some priced 3x as much as the Boss, but I kept coming back to the TR-2. For a fraction of the cost, it sounds just as sweet as the rest. You can't beat the value.                 
Great tremolo pedal, even better value! Don't over-think it.                 
Forget all the comments about volume drop.  There is no volume drop and this pedal does not color your tone one bit.    I tried a couple of what I call minature novelty pedals and they were more like a volume boost-tone pedal.  I wanted something to dress up my slow ballads and of course "Born On The Bayou".  This is totally transparent sound wise and perfect.  Boss wins again.                
This is the best built, best sounding tremolo for the money... What doesn't work for me is the very small taper area of common rate speeds all within 10 to 2 on the rate control. So many effects today employ a Tap Tempo to achieve the correct speed for a song. Trying to dial these correct tempos in is nearly impossible... Roland Boss fixed the volume drop... Now, they need to spread out the Rate Taper... Then this pedal would be perfect.                
As much as I dig these pedal for what it does and it does sound good when set right,I had to remove it from my pedal board cause it seems to cause my low end all of a sudden disappears. I have eleven Boss pedals and two DC-Brick power supply's and whenever I add the TR-2 my low end disappears. The rest of the Boss pedals have a great buffer except this TR-2. Maybe Boss needs to go back to the drawing board on this particular pedal...                
This is by far the most accurate, easy to use tuner of this side. Even better than ones that cost 3x more!!! Get a couple                
I've used this for both the bass and guitar in live settings and it's done everything I could want it to do.  If you take the time to learn how to switch the modes, there are no issues at all.  I love the mute/gate when it is engaged as I do some bass playing for religious services and it is a great to be able to tune/adjust quickly on the fly.  The LED lights are nice and bright and visible when the stage lighting is bright.  Additionally, I've found the accuracy of the tuning to be spot on.                
Most useful features described above.  However, if you're going to use it alot, get a power adapter.  This thing loves batteries.  But DON'T buy the Boss one.  I bought the "one spot" adapter and it has held up far better with no issues.  Didn't give it a 10 due to the adaptor Boss has and the fact that it loves batteries.                
I read manuals unlike most people.  So if you read the manual, it is SIMPLE to use.  I browsed through the little manual in the box and had it up and running for both guitar and bass and can now change it on the fly.                
Boss - always has rugged dependable stuff.  Their adapters suck though.  Get a 'One Spot'.                
I have a Korg rack tuner for bigger gigs, and I use this for smaller ones.  Well worth the money for the smaller gigs but could be used for large ones as well it that's your preference.                
Never have needed support of any kind.  Says alot about their products if you ask me.                
I've always been partial to the simplicity/look of MXR boxes as the Boss boxes are a bit bigger.  But I have no issues with this one at all.  It has already received its share of nicks and bumps from consistant setup and tear down - that makes it "prettier" in my opinion.                
Overall a 9 - again, hate the adapter, but this product itself is worth every penny.                
Doesn't produce sound. It's a tuner.                
This is amazing! It allows you to tune basses, guitars, everything! In all tunings!                
All you do is plug on end of the cord into you amp, and the other end into the input of the pedal and press down on the pedal and it tunes for you.                
100% awesome.                
I would reccomend this over any other tuner.                
I'm a novice and I previously used a super snark for tuning but since getting the TU-3 it's all I use. very easy to use and accurate, I've even set my intonation by it. The only thing I don't like is when you go sharp, say C sharp, the tiny dot that represents # is hard to see for my old eyes. If you run this on battery be sure to unhook the instrument cable from it when your done or it will eat your battery up by morning. plugging the instrument cable into it is what actually turns it on , not stepping on it. zZounds is quick to ship, love it!                
It's a tuner and isn't supposed to affect the sound.                
Incredibly practical to have highly visible, silent turning available while on stage.                
Easy to turn on and off. One of the visual tuning aid modes is very good, the other less so. I have a feeling they could come up with something a little less busy if they worked on it. It's very clear when the tuning is dead on, sometimes a little less clear as to which way to adjust it.                
Seems very rugged.                
I haven't seen many similar tuners. It's definitely worth the extra money as compared to the Boss non-pedal tuner.                
n/a                
Assuming it doesn't wear out or die prematurely, I would definitely replace it with the same model.                
It doesn't seem to add any noise to the signal, so it's fine to leave it in the effects chain.                
Works great.                  
Easy to use.                
Built like a tank.                
It's worth it, definitely.                
I registered the product at the Roland website.  It was an easy, hassle-free process.                
It's not all that great to look at, but it does what it does so well, aesthetics are irrelevant.                
This is my go-to tuner, for now.  I don't expect that to change any time soon.                
Works as it should. The buffer in it is very good. Gives you consistent tone when ran 1st before all your other pedals, but after a fuzz.                
The different modes for tuning are super useful, and high brightness mode is helpful for bright environments.                
Dirt simple to use                
super well made, bullet proof like all other boss pedals.                
yeah its worth the money, but now in days, you can tune more than one string at once, and other tuners have better displays or more accuracy. But this is one is better for tone and built stronger.                
nope no need to                
I rate it super well. Its improved my tone running it 1st. The buffer is one of the best I've tried,                 
Great tuner. Well built. Great buffer. Consistent tone. Will last a long time.                
I used this tuner for a week now, I really like it. I just can not understand why I am blowing through batteries  so fast. Do I have to unplug the pedal every time I am done with it?  I step on it to turn it off but the next day I go to use it, the battery is dead. these batteries are almost $10 a piece. maybe I am doing something wrong. this is my first pedal. the Pedal Works like a charm it is very accurate.                
I've had it since its first inception in 2010 and am glad I have it on my pedalboard! I bought two of them,one for back up.  I don't care how great of a Guitar/Bass player someone thinks they are,if your not in tune all the time,YOU WILL SUCK! and loose gigs.. I play semi-pro gigs  that pay! and let me tell you they don't have time for mickey mouse teenage guitarist mentality. If you cant tune your guitar fast and deliver the goods that your expected you don't get a call back.....THIS TUNER HAS SAVE ME LOTS OF GOOD GIGS! and the plus side,no tone loose at all.                
Thud! If you drop it, it makes a thud, nut this thing is built to last.                
I really like how of you want to tune your guitar to drop D or anything, it will show you how far you are from it. The little LED lights are spot-on with pitch accuracy.                
Very easy. It's so simple and so effective, best tuner out on the market. Except for maybe Gibson's Min-etune thing.                
It's built like a tank. It's made of metal and pretty darn durable. I dropped it one time, and there wasn't even a scratch!!!                
Well worth the $100. Could be $85, nut I'm kinda cheap. Well worth the money for sure. I entered in everything as 5-stars, but it wouldn't keep them for some reason.                
No, but I'm sure they're pretty Boss-y                
WOW! Its an essential, and I was pretty picky about pedal tuners, since I can't really hear myself on stage or practice. This little thing is really helpful as well as convenient.                
I honestly wasn't expecting much, but when it arrived I quickly changed my mind. It was kind of funny, because when I opened it a few papers flew out of the little box it's in. It sure does it job, very very accurate if you know how to use it!                
The pedal has precise tuning and takes 3 seconds to get up and running. I know many friends who use this pedal and swear by it, which is why I purchased it.I'm Incredibly happy with it and I'm looking forward to having this around for a very long time!                
The inline Boss TU-3 is perfect for outdoor gigs where temperature changes require frequent retuning.  Just step on the pedal, tune offline without disconnecting any cords or turning off the amp, then click again and you're back in business.  It also eliminates amp poping sounds when switching guitars.  The indicator is easy to read from a standing position.                
Works as advertised.  Necessity for ANY pedal board.                
Love the tuner so couldn't bring myself to rate it poorly even though it doen't produce sound.                
Love the Sweep function and the off standard memorization settings. Our Church piano is tuned at 438(!) instead of 440. My other tuner, though capable of setting to 438, it reverts back to standard on power up.                
Lots of features, so it does take some time to get comfortable with the operation.                
Still have a Tu-2 (?). Not even sure how old it is, but it still works fine. Also have several other foot pedals from the company and all still work.                
Great price from Zzounds and this tuner will last forever.                
Though I haven't had to use them. Again can't give them a rating hit because their product performs so well for so long....                
Have a couple tuners, but HAD to have this one for all the features, reliability and ease of use                
Doubt I'll ever need to purchase another tuner unless I get tired of carting this one back and forth.                
By far the best tuner for the money hands down. This pedal is durable, reliable, and always dependable. I have seen way more expensive rack tuners that can't touch this tuner!                
Why in the world would you only have a "sharp" indicator, when almost everyone tunes to "flat"?  Sure, you know that d sharp is the same as e flat, but especially when quickly dropping your low string on a e flat guitar to d flat, who wants to even waste that much attention if you only have a few seconds between songs?  My son plays onstage with four guitars in four different tunings, some to standard and some flat, so using just the "flat mode" is not an option.  Lots of options on this pedal, but I think that's where the problem lies:  it's trying to be all things to all players.  Overall, it tries to do too much at once and wind up doing it's job less well as a result.  Bypass is dead silent, so that's nice.  Power supply would be handy if I didn't already have one.  Overall, underwhelming.  I expected more from Boss.                
No draw on tone that I hear. I believe it is true bypass.                
Use it on anything you'd like.                
Little weird at first but it is a good solid tuner.                
This company (roland/boss/edirol) will be around for a long time.                
It was a a gift. Priceless as they say.                 
Web site is pretty good and has all manuals etc.                
Never used a tuner. I can tune on the fly.
