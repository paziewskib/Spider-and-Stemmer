It fits well, build quality is decent. There is really no other option if you need to rack-mount the Qu-16 mixer.                
Okay, I owned the first generation Mix Wiz for my 5 piece rock band and was very pleased with it. Two generations have come since, the Mix Wiz 3 and now 4. I was ready to upgrade and actually bought the Soundcraft FX 16:2 which was supposed to be comparable. It was not, MAYBE it is with my old A&H model, but I wanted better, so I took the Souncraft back and bought the A&H Mix Wiz 4. All I can say is it blew me away !. They say they have re-designed and upgraded the pre-amps. THEY HAVE !! Much more punch and headroom which is just what I was looking for, and the new digital effects have improved. EQ In/ out switch has been added. It is very sturdily built. This is truly a great board for a rock band needing lots of headroom and great sound quality.

I work sound for an area band, started small with mixers , and found what I wanted....this little mixer has it all, and with a name that is rated as one of the best. The Allen & Heath has all the great features of larger format mixers, not to mention USB connectivity for recording right to a personal device or lap top. Comes with lots of added recording software that takes time to understand, but once understood, works great. The effects are basic and has enough to do what is wanted for live performances. Only down fall is that if you want to add this unit into a case, you need to really search around to find the ears, not everyone carries them. For the money, all and all perfect mixer for small to average sized groups..                
This is the first time I have had my hands on A and H products and I have to say, very nice. It is well built, the pots feel good, connectors are high quality units with good hold. Sound is nice and transparent. I use an off board preamp so my mics go right into line in on the channels, however I did test out the full potential of the pre's and I say very nice. Lot of gain, little to no noise. Board is well designed, easy for me to see even though there is a lot packed on it in a small space, for what it does. I have not tried the USB part of it, that was an option that I did not need so I can not say as to it's usability. I am using 2 Blue Bluebirds and a Woodpecker with ART preamp, leveler, and eq. High end, transparent, natural sound does not cost a fortune to achieve if you know the best place for your pieces. I recommend A and H and if I upgrade a mixer in the future, it will be them.                
The Allen & Heath ZED 18 is an incredible board if you're doing mid/small sized clubs. It's got 10 XLR input channels, which suits my little 4 piece band pretty well. To keep it affordable A&H didn't include any onboard effects, which is okay with me since I find onboard effects to be a little "lacking" sometimes. Setup on this thing was a breeze! I took it out of the box, mounted it into my rack, connected a Lexicon MX200...ran my QSC K12's to the board and LIFTOFF! Just doing a few "check check's" made me realize that this board was going to work out phenomenally. I didn't even need an actual EQ, the preamps were so crystal clear, combined with sweepable mids and some 100mm faders, I had a good vocal mix right out of the box. I've yet to hook it up for home studio use, but I'm sure I will get to that sometime, since it comes with a USB hookup and the Cakewalk Sonar software...it'll be something to tinker with in the future. If you're looking for a really simple setup, with great quality and clarity, I'd say look no farther than the Allen & Heath ZED 18.                
I was just like you deciding on a major purchase to improve my entertainment business. I read many reviews of many different mixers.  Finally started my hands on journey .
Presonus 16.0.2 : A fine little mixer, takes about a day to learn coming from analog. Firewire 400 connection, confusing  effects, not what i would consider a Live performance mixer. $899
Presonus 16.4.2AI : Huge upgrade to the 16.0.2. easier to learn than the 16.0.2, firewire 800, effects were nice, but with everything I tried the vocals were thin, I really wanted to like this board, the size is huge!, took it to a live gig, nothing but feedback problems from the get go. $1399
Zed12fx : So after that, I was really hating the idea of a digital mixer. So I tried the zed12fx analog. Probably the best analog mixer I had ever used, if the USB connector hadn’t become unstable, I would probably still have it. $499
Than I read a review of the Allen & Heath QU-16C, as a matter of fact I read many. This mixer took all of 3 hours to get acquainted with and performed flawlessly. Vocals were spot on, effects are easy to manipulate,  USB connection, qu-drive makes quick recording simple. Build quality is second to none. Did my first LIVE gig with it over the weekend, gave myself an hour to setup but only took 10 minutes. $1799
Conclusion:  I ended up learning that what I wanted in a mixer were, Clear vocals, Great Effects, Compression, Equalizer, Build Quality and Easy Recording. My decision ended up costing more than I had wanted to spend, but my peace of mind was worth it.
I purchased this mixer 3 months ago for my home studio and i must say i am very pleased with the functionality, ease of use and overall integration with my set up. Having 3 layers of 32 faders, all my gear technically feeds right into it, including the DAW sofware i'm using. No complaints for me sor far yet.                 
I purchased my QU32 approximately 4 months ago and have been happy ever since. With a few tweaks, it can be even better.  Pros: Great motorized faders, custom group setting for faster access, Great EQs, Easy recording settings, Lightweight and easily portable...Cons: Can't customize channel colorization, Needs better RTA (Midas M32 style). Overall, very pleased and would recommend over other comparable consoles.                 
I had owned the QU-16, which is a fantastic mixer. The only downfall I found was it's size. So when I heard about the QU-SB, I knew I needed to check it out.
I absolutely love this mixer, very compact size, all the bells and whistles of the QU Series mixers, QU-Drive works fantastically, The QU-Pad app is as close to perfect as Ive ever seen. If you need a new mixer, this is it!
Don't hesitate, you will not be disappointed. at 700 dollars less than the QU-16 for the same machine it's a no brainer.
Love this little Monster
Remember you can Hardwire the ipad to the mixer using a couple adapters, if you're afraid of just using a wireless connection.                
Ease of operation, great sounding, good looks, connects easy With other stuff, super features, All in All Best in class.                
For 300$ or so, you cant beat this mixer - I had studio monitors for years and they never sounded so good, until i got this mixer. Just so you know, you can actually hook up 2 turntables and 2 cd players, of course you can only control 2 channels, but if you are on a budget, its great - the sound is amazing, so clean and pure - i would recommend to anyone -                 
To start off this mixer sounds fantastic! The build quality is awesome, and the filters are a lot of fun to play with. The price is decent, very solid mixer for the price. This mixer would be the ultimate 2 channel mixer for me, if not for a few things. My main gripe is that the LED meter only represents the master output of the mixer, there is no individual channel output LED (channel 1 or 2 option). I like to eyeball the trim levels with the channel LEDs before mixing, and not being able throws me off a little. The other gripes I have is the xone innofader can be a little difficult to track down, not impossible though. Lastly, there is weird phasing when using an rmx 500/1000 unit with send/return. Wish they had placed a wet/dry knob on this mixer, like on their xone 43. Not really a big deal, but I think its worth mentioning. Overall I'm not totally unhappy with this mixer, but I'm not entirely sold yet. I find it's taking me longer than expected to get used to it. Wish I hadn't thrown out my box, I probably would have returned it. I just really thought I would have liked it more                
Simply amazing mixer, Sound quality is spectacular, build quality very solid and pro feeling, Allen Heath filter the BEST !! plus Digital effects, can't complain very worth spending.  Love it !!!                
At this price point, sound is a definite 10. I had a mackie 1202-vlz3 and was happy with it, replaced it with the ZED mostly because I wanted the integrated effects unit. I was shocked however, by the improvement in sound of the preamps, mix engine and overall quality of the ZED compared to the Mackie. My live sound really took a step forward by comparison. The effects too are excellent quality themselves. I think this mixer is just an amazing bargain.                
The main omission is channel mutes - really miss these compared to the mackie. It's nice to have USB computer interface included but keep in mind it's just 16-bit. If only it was 24-bit, combined with the high quality mic preamps the ZED could be a very credible studio interface in addition to live mixer. As it is, the USB recording capability is a nice-to-have add-on for recording performances and rehearsals, but not much more.                
About as easy to use as you can expect for a small mixer with effects and USB recording built in. Go through the manual and work with it for a few sessions and you'll have it down.                
Similar to Mackie quality. Metal parts and switches might be a tad 'lighter' and it does use plastic end panels. To the good is an internal power supply and the knobs and connectors all feel solid. No worries, but if you're gigging with it much I'd get some kind of case or at least a gig bag.                
Unless you really must have channel mutes this is the only thing I'd consider in the price range. The sound quality is simply miles ahead of the competition in the range.                
Haven't needed support. The manual is good and I've noticed the designer from A&H hangs out on Gearslutz from time to time..                
Not a terribly pretty thing. More geek appeal than sex appeal. I could see having some wooden end caps made to replace the plastic though. That would be hot.                
Easily the best under $300 mixer I've owned. If sound quality is the most important consideration to you, don't hesitate, get this one.                
Sound: At this price point, sound is a definite 10. I had a Alto Zephyr ZMX862 and was happy with it, until i bought the Allen & Heath Zed10FX mostly because of the very noticeable sound quality difference. The effects were not as much of a seller because the Alto mixer had effects on it as well. I am very pleased with the sound and the mix as i can hear every nuance between my 3 keyboard plugged into it. My sound is really sharp and tight and i only have the master volume half way up. Features: The only con is there is no way to mute channels. It's nice to have USB functionality but it's only 16-bit. USB recording capability is a nice-to-have but you can only do 2 tracks at a time.
Ease of Use: Board was easy to set up and install i was up and running in under 5 minutes.
Quality: Great quality and build very sturdy and stays in place on my mixer table.
Manufactuer Support: I have only had this board for 1 day, i have not needed to contact customer support at all.
Value: if you are looking for superb sound in a small package then don't be alarmed by the price point but focus on the quality of the sound you will get in return. I have had other mixers in the $50-150 range and they sounded good but at the end of the day you get what you pay for.
Wow Factor: I finally saved up enough money to get a Top of line name brand mixer and i must say that i am impressed. I played around with the Digital mixer by Allen and Heath and was  impressed as well.                
I'm a writer/singer first, and a sound guy a distant second. So this mixer worked well for my level of (in) expertise. I use it with a LD MAUI 11 PA. It will be a long time before I learn all the capabilities of this board. But I'm still able to be operational at my novice level with it. My gigs are usually solo with guitar, vocal harmonica. So I use two channels, one voice and one guitar. A little reverb on the voice and that's it. Keep it simple but it projects a nice balance for reaching the type of audience I tend to play for (50-100 listeners). One thing I did notice is that using the HiZ channel for my guitar causes a lot of percussive sounds from the body of the guitar to be heard.  Any contact with my hands on the guitar body is picked up, as well as pick sounds on the strings. I think this is due to the fact that I'm already playing through a L.R. Baggs Venue DI. and Lyric pickup. The HiZ makes sense if you are playing without the DI/preamp. And, when I plug the guitar into a non-HiZ channe,l the contact sounds go away. So I just avoid the HiZ channel with my guitar set up and it works fine. Maybe someone with more expertise in sound than I have would care to comment on this.                
First, zzounds.com was great! My order arrived early and was well packaged. I order most of my cables and consumer level stuff here and the experience has always been great! 
The Allen and Heath ZED10fx is what it is. On the up side, I didn't think I would hear a difference in the slightly higher quality preamps, but I did! It sounds slightly cleaner and more airy than the 12fx. Also,  I noticed that the effects on this little guy seem smoother- I read that they pulled the algorithms out of the big ilive stuff and used a few of them in the 10fx. It could also be that the cleaner pre's are a little more phase coherent and play well with the effects? Meh, either way it sounds a little better than my 12fx, which I also bought here. The EQ's are decent. Not bad at all. 
Down side - if you add the high-pass filter, it takes away from the fidelity a little. If you engage the phantom power, sometimes there is a brief popping, and it brings the fidelity down yet another notch. They really need to improve the grounding scheme on this thing. So, I use a high quality external phantom power source, and don't use the high-pass filter. Some of the pots are loose, as if they might pop off here soon. This is all a quality control issue with Allen and heath, not zzounds. 
Over all, the board is doing what I needed it to do, and that is sit there and be quiet - pun intended! So long that I do not engage a filter of any kind.                 
I play in a band and record at home. For recording at home, since I play all the instruments, I record one track at a time, and for this, the USB output works great. I can put reverb in my headphones but record a raw sound so I don't have to commit to a verb till mixdown. The routing is very flexible and it boosts the signal on my Nord electro keyboard, which has notoriously low outputs, before it hits my QSC K10 speaker. It is lightweight and built with quality components. I would buy it again if it were lost.                
I was extremely satisfied with this mixer. It was very quiet and I was able to interface it with my recording program for some excellent tracks. Well worth the price!!                
I love this mixer, and it has served phenomenally in live performance applications, but I bought it with the mistaken impression that I could use it to record at least 6 tracks simultaneously through the USB port into my recording software, to be mixed separately on the computer.  It cannot!  You can make an analog mix of your 6 tracks on the mixer and send that in, but you get 2 tracks to work with on the computer.  That's it.  Very disappointed, and pretty sure I can't return it at this point.  bummed. :(                
Very clean. I like it.                
I was very happy, I returned it and upgraded to the ZED14FX.                
Somewhat easy but the manual can be upgraded like how mackie does their manual.                
Only tried it foe a couple weeks, but it feels pretty well built.                
Awesome value for quality                
Did not use support                
Love the way it looks, it's practicallity,function and it seems like it's built to last.                
I loved it so I upgraded to the ZED14 right away. It it gets lost/stolen I will be heartbroken and buy the same one next time.                
I bought this little mixer for three purposes: mixing for band practice sessions, streaming ipod music through my powered speakers, and interfacing with Sonar to record music track by track. This mixer does all three things well and the sound quality is great. Getting it to work with Sonar required installing the free ASIO4ALL utility.                
Outstanding addition to my gear!!! The sound quality is really great!                
The pre amps alone are worth the price of admission. They are clean, quiet, musical and are good enough to use for recording if you have a good sound card or interface. They are the best small format pres I have heard so far and beat the heck out of Mackies and the SoundCraft small format mixers. The FET DI inputs on channels 3 & 4 actually work quite well on Bass guitar. Haven't had a chance to use them much on guitar, but I tried running the line out of my VBT1 into one of them with interesting results. The EQ sections sounds fine, although I tend to run things flat because I use it primarily as recording sub mixer for drums and such. The FX are limited but quite usable for live and if you want just a touch of reverb on the monitors or even recording.                
Very nice feature set. I really appreciate the mic level main out capability for chaining to another mixer. The extensive routing capabilities are extremely useful. The primary downside is no mute buttons, but it really isn't a problem, more a matter of convenience. As for the USB, I really don't use it because it is a 1.1 interface and is limited to 16 bits, but if that is all you need it is fine.                 
Plug and play! The routing paths being printed on the mixer makes it really easy to set up in a hurry.                 
This thing is built like a tank! While a tad small (hey, it's a small mixer!), all the knobs and switches have a very good feel. The rotary controls are nicely damped and are very smooth. You feel like you are using a much larger, more expensive mixer. The Zed10's are bit more expensive than some similar models, but if you get one, you will know why the minute you open the box. I just want to add ZZounds did me a great deal with their price matching and I got the FX unit cheaper than the non-FX. Take advantage of their price matching! I have become a hard core ZZounds fan!                
This is one of the best mixers for the money there is. And like I said, with the ZZounds price matching, I got an amazing price but it also enabled me to get that price from a company I trust. I don't know how much ZZounds will want me to say, but let's just say for $229, you would have to pay far more to equal the quality, sound, and features....                
Contacted them about some compatibility issues and they responded promptly and not with a form email.                
It is attractive and well made.                
I expect this thing to be around for a looooong time. My next purchase will be to get more inputs, but after my experience with this small format Allen Heath, I will definitely look at them first for my next mixer.                
I have used Mackie mixers for 13 years now. This is the first mixer other than Mackie that I have used, and I have to say, I wished that I have bought Allen & Heath years ago. This is by far the best mixer I have ever played through. The sound is transparent and silky smooth. The effects are like butter and is a pleasure playing every night with the mixer.                
For what I need it for, you can't beat what it has to offer. I am just a solo guitarist, and for my needs, it's the best. I did a trio last night and worked very well. The other 2 musicians were in awe with the smoothness and the sound clarity of this board.                
Very easy, and straight forward.                 
This mixer is built and feels like a tank. Everything from the knobs to the sliders feels like it was made to stand time and usage. Very well built.                
For the price, I don't think you can find a better mixer with what it offers. Allen & Heath really outdid themselves when designing this mixer.                
N/A                
The color and aesthetics of this mixer looks great. I love the color coordination of the sliders and knobs. You won't get confused with all knobs being black and searching up and down for what you need.                
I have used Mackie mixers for 13 years now and that mixer lasted the 13 years since I bought it. This mixer, the way it feels and performs, should last me till it dies. Even if it does dies on me, you know I'll be getting another one to replace it in a heartbeat.                
Superior!  If you are looking for a professional mixer; grab this one, extremely quite - very impressed.                
Should handle just about anything you can throw at it - many options.                
Probably best for musicians who have experience; however, read the manual and experiment; you'll like it.                
This is my fourth mixer - just wish I had invested in a top of the line mixer in the beginning; could have saved alot of money.                
Hey if you have too - the ez 4 payment program is there if you need it.  They can't make it any easier.                
Treated me right the first time on the phone - had no other reason to call them - they already researched and gave me the lowest price.                
You can see that alot of pride was taken into consideration when they designed this mixer.  In my opinion; it can't get any better (looks & quality)                
You'll never need to buy another one - I'm through looking!                
After many years of trying to cut corners by purchasing inexpensive mixers, I finally decided enough was enough of my constant trips to my favorite electronics repair business. I was tired of losing sleep on nights before a gig-hoping and praying that my mixer would not die again in the middle of a performance. I have always adopted the belief that you must have a backup plan to your backup plan. I still run a rack system and any element (EQ,Compressor, etc.) other than the mixer can just be immediately bypassed-but not the mixer. Mixer dies and there is no sound-period! I currently own 3 identical Behringer Xenyx 2442FX mixers, and although they sound fine and are full of features when working, at least one of them is in the repair shop constantly. I always used one and had a backup close at hand. I finally decided to remedy this problem once and for all and I began researching what would be the absolute best fit mixer for my needs (DJ oldies/beach/motown/top 40/R & B plus live praise band) . After an exhaustive search and review during which I chose to not be concerned about initial cost outlay, the overall choice was an Allen & Heath ZED12FX. I did cost comparisons and found my best deal (by buying a blemished unit on which I have yet to find a blemish) was at zZSounds. I even called their toll free number and spoke with one of their reps who was extremely honest and helpful. Ordered on Sunday and arrived at my home in NC on Wednesday, I was immediately impressed with the quality build of this unit. Upon hooking it up, the sound is incredible, the reverbs are perfect, very easy to route, had the multiple stereo channels I must have, main insert points that I prefer, love the 100mm sliders, and easy to get to everything. My only regret is that there is no gooseneck light socket. Other than that, this mixer has far exceeded my hopes and expectations.The sad part is this: I bought 3 Behringer Xenyx mixers at different times over the years and had terrible reliability. For less than $200 more than any single one of these Behringers, I bought the A&H ZED12FX and probably have the last mixer I will ever have to buy and fully expect it to be worry free, as it has been for the short time I've owned it. I would have saved myself a lot of stress and cash had I bought an Allen & Heath years ago.  
Understand I am not a Behringer basher. I still have 2 of their Europower amps (2500 & 4000) and absolutely love them. I have other Behringer stuff in my rack and am pleased with those also. I just will never buy another Behringer mixer. I'm sticking with Allen & Heath after experiencing the incredible quality of my new worry free mixer.  I have no complaints whatsoever about the sound, performance or look of this mixer. As stated earlier, my only regret is I just wish A & H would install a light socket jack for my gooseneck light.
I have had no need for Manufacturer Support because I have had no problems with this mixer and really do not expect that I ever will, based on how solid and well built it seems to be. Part of my decision making process to choose this mixer, however, was the reviews I read by owners of A & H equipment who praised the support on the rare occasion it was needed.                
Sound quality is excellent and the effects are all usable especially in vocal areas. The addition of parameters to customize the various effects is also a great feature.                
There are many features in this board. I use if for live sound. The channel eq is adequate and the addition of a shelf mid frequency is very useful to adjust those critical vocal frequencies. One question to the manufactures is why there is no master control for the auxiliary 3; I use that auxiliary to drive the subwoofers and it would be useful to control their master output.                 
You have to have some knowledge of basic sound eng. and set up.                
Well built. LIke the red sides...does not have a good place to grab it if you wanted to take it out of a case. 
The power switch is a push button on the back of the unit; if you put it in a case or a bag with the back of the unit on the bottom then the switch get pushed in by the weight of the unit and that may damage the switch.                
N/A                
Nice looking and light.                 
We use this for an acoustic trio and it sounds fabulous both live and as the interface in our home studio.  I think it's best to describe the sound as present, transparent and clean.  When we've recorded with it, the recordings are rich and full (recorded in Digital Performer with a decent large condenser mic).  We use it with a pair of QSC K-10s (one for FOH and one as a monitor) in small coffee houses and the sound is fabulous when the mixer is working - see below about the problems we've had recently.                
We're a little disappointed with the FX.  You would be better served to just get an external FX unit and add it to your rack mount (we have our 12FX mounted and there is space for one fx unit).  The sweepable mids are fabulous on guitars.  Being able to rack mount it with the kit (not provided) is great.  We also like the 1/8th inch headphone jack.  Finally, the inserts for the entire mix are wonderful for adding some overall compression when we play live.                
Learning curve was pretty small, but I'm pretty experienced with mixers and gear in general.  If you know your way around a mixer, you won't have any problems.  The manual spells is all out and the only issue we had was resolved by RTFM.                
Here's where we are totally disappointed.  Only 60 days after having this mixer, the right output on channel 4 and the right output of the headphone mix have completely gone out on us.  The former happened during a gig (thankfully we were using the right main as our monitor mix and the left main for FOH so the crowd had no idea what was happening).  But, we were completely distracted by the horrible distortion coming from what turned out to be channel 4 going out.  The next day we were recording and noticed that the right side of the headphone mix was also out.  However, other than these internal problems, the mixer seems very well built in terms of stability of parts.  The nobs feel very sturdy, and it looks excellent.  Of course, we will always have it in a SKB case so we're not taking any chances.                 
It's a little spendy and we wish we hadn't gone for the internal FX, which do not seem worth the money spent.                
The American distributor for Allen and Heath was very helpful when the mixer had issues.  We are taking to a local repair shop this week and the repair will happen under warranty.  We don't anticipate there being any problems going forward and while this has dampened our initial enthusiasm, the mixer still sounds incredible and we are very, very glad we chose it over the comparable Mackie.  It just sounds richer and more full.                
It looks awesome.  It feels solid and smooth.  If we didn't have the channel issue we'd be in love.                
Assuming the channel issue works itself out and the repair is our last, we are going to be using this mixer for a long, long time.  For a larger band you'll want more inputs but for us, it's perfect.                  
A little about myself, I do Gigs as a KJ (karaoke DJ) as well as a DJ for weddings and such. I use 2 Bose L1M2 systems. Running both from my MacBook Pro.  Doing this for about 7 years now.
So I recently found myself needing a new mixer. 
My first thought was the Bose T1 tone match, so i bought it and used it for a few gigs. Until a wedding where I needed more inputs. It’s a fine mini-mixer, kind of look silly with all my huge system. So I decided to make it my backup.
Next I decided to go bigger digital, so I ordered the 16.0.2 from presonus. Nice mixer, didn't take too long of a learning curve. Nice size, very tinny sound compared to analog mixers I had used in the past. Firewire 400 connection to the Mac, so i needed to buy an adapter. Then the firewire plug on the back became loose, sound cutting in and out. I returned it.
I kind of liked the way presonus had laid out there mixers so I bought the 16.4.2AI, Big improvement over the 16.0.2, Big price difference as well. Huge mixer! ( I mean HUGE) firewire 800 this time.
decided this was the one, until I went to record a show and found out that the FX bus doesn't record without some major tweeting. Well this is a big part of my Gigs, recording singers and such. Also if you don't use firewire and just use the AUX input, it takes some tweaking to get any real punch in your volume. Reluctantly I sent it back.
I have ran the ZED12FX before and it was always reliable and sounded great, also ran the sound craft sig 12 mtg, when it first came out.
The SC is a solid unit, but the zed is far superior IMO. So today I'm back to analog, running the ZED12FX 
The ZED12FX is a true workhorse, digital mixers try to duplicate the sound of analog mixers, but for me as long as they still make analog mixers, I will stick with them.
Just because a digital mixer costs more does not mean it will fulfill your needs. 
The ZED12FX is old school and as easy as pie to record your show back to the computer. I guess Im a tech head always thinking that NEW means better. The mono out makes it easy to just use one of my bose systems . The smaller zeds don’t have that feature and neither do the SC.
But last weekend I had over 300 people that thought my old school analog sound system was the bomb.
This is a great buy for the money,Extremely impressed!                
I just purchased this mixer, i wish it had more EQ on the stereo channels.Over all sound is ok i guess. I made my purchase based on the couple of other reviews i read. For being an Allen & Heath, i'm just a little dissapointed.                
As far as the features go with the USB capabilities they are fine. However i am very disapointed with the effects. Not at all what i expected.                
What's hard about using a basic mixer?                
Built well, should last a long time. However, here again, assembled over seas. Even good products can develop problems, so build quality now days, still doesn't mean much.                
I think this board is over priced, for what you're getting. Would i replace this mixer with another just like it? Most likely not.                
I wrote Allen & Health a few emails inquiring about the Zen 12FX. They were very quick to reply. So i think customer service wouldn't be an issue.                
This mixer looks fantastic. But i was expecting more.                
I bought this as a triple purpose mixer. I run an open mic night with it, mix my bands live performances (1 main bus, 2 monitor mixes, and a outboard reverb stereo bus from my Mac) and for recording my podcast. The preamps on this mixer are great. The EQ is nice, I love that this mixer has channel inserts at this price range. The 100m faders feel great. The knobs feel solid and the construction seems to be top knotch. This mixer works great right out of the box and if I had any complaint I could see the aux bus routing being a little confusing at first, but not insurmountable with a little bit of experimentation.                
This is my second Allen & Heath sound board, I need something to mix a band and pre-recorded music.  This covers all the connections I need to mix, plus some.  It is so easy to use and setup very quickly in the sound check, and is a solid board.  Nobs don't feel cheap, this is a very good buy for the price.  I have used this for DJing dances, parties, karaoke........Love it!                
The ZED14 mixer is designed primarily for live performance but I have been using it for recording with very good results. There is a lot of functionality and selections related to PLF and USB & Aux bus routing. Some of the choices are not intuitive but an e-mail to Allen & Heath customer tech support resulted in prompt and excellent answers to all of my questions. The USB connection to my DAW PC works seamlessly, no special drivers required. This board surpasses small Mackie and Yamaha mixers that I have owned previously. You really can't go wrong for the price point.                
We upgraded from a Yamaha 512c mixer and are absolutely amazed at the clarity of the Allen & Heath ZED22FX Mixer. We did buy 2 of the CRown XTI 4000's to run the mixer so I'm sure that helped.  We have only used it for a couple of shows but after we played around with it for a couple of hours mixing different sounds and effects we were able to set up and get a solid sound check fast.  We have not used the usb recording feature yet, but it looks pretty straight forward.                
Seems to have all the features our band needs for the present and forseeable future.  The effects are good andcan be controlled exactly like you want them.                
After you learn the board features and where everything is located it's pretty easy to set up and go.  The manual and guide provides you with what you need to know.  Just take a couple of hours at home to go over things.                
It's a solidly built mixer, metal with good markings and finish.  The controls are sturdy and the unit seems road worthy.                
I got a price match as always and am happy with what I am paying for.                
nothing yet                
Looks,feels and sounds great!                
I don't think we will be searching for anything for a while. If the mixer were stolen I would replace it with another Allen & Heath.  I looked at Yamaha, Peavey, and Mackie mixers. Bang for the buck I felt that the Allen & Heath gave me more features for the money!                
I was looking for a board that would fit my needs and not break the bank too.I had a 12 channel Euro pro that I was using and the difference is night and day.Even though they both had effects, I could tell right away that the ZED had way better quality and even had good comments from the band members on how much better the sound was. I'm not real good at soundboards but this was easy to use.I'm not sorry at all for the getting the board. The board showed up in great shape from shipping. zZounds did a great job packaging. Would do biz again if I have to.

the sound quality is the best i have owned..i am a powered mixer kinda guy..so i was hesitant to invest in a non powered mixer. but now im glad i did..powered by a ceown xti2000 the sound is rich clear and perfect                
usb connectivity was so important..the zed24 fullfillrd all my expectations and then some...                
its so easy to hookup and run my 14 yr. old son can set it up for a 7 pc band..                
for the price it looks great it sounds great...                
nope...                
a perfect 10                
i would replace it quickly with another zed24                
I needed a little mixer for my new mic. I choose the Zed6FX because it was just that a small mixer with a quality name brand and a plethora of effects. Those are pretty much the reasons that I would recommend this mixer if you're looking for quality and awesome effects this has it.The downside of it is that it is as titled "compact". I found that the knobs were difficult to turn because they are spaced so tightly together making it hard to get your fingers in between them. They're even more annoying to use than the knobs on the Roland Boutiques if that gives you an idea how small they are. another problem with the mixer is that it's only output is an single 1/4 effects out and 2 XLR outputs. There is no RCA or 1/4 Stereo outputs. This cuts down a lot of the usefulness of this mixer if you don't plan on using it with a USB interface or only need XLR's. You can purchase converter cables like XLR to 1/4 to solve that issue but still it's an extra expense you might want to consider.The XLR inputs are usually found on studio monitor speakers but so are RCA outputs. So just being limited on your output options really kicks down the mixers usability a notch in my eyes.I will say that for the price range the ZED6FX is in that most other mixers in the same range have RCA or 1/4 outputs at well as XLR's.My best recommendation is that this is a mixer for those that want an Allen & Heath and would like a more sleeker look and tad nicer build quality over the other mixers like Sound Craft, Yamaha, or Mackie.I will note that I believe Mackie's PRO FX series would be a better choice as it's not only cheaper but it has both RCA & 1/4 outputs both in stereo as well as a multitude of effects and best of all it has a graphic equalizer. I would have purchased one of their mixers had I not gotten the ZED6FX at such a good price.I also want to note because it's not made very clear by Allen and Heath's marketing but the ZED6 mixers are different from the ZEDi8 and ZEDi10 in that they do not feature USB or the recording program that's bundled with the 8 and 10 versions. If you're looking for USB support this mixer is incapable of doing that. I'm not sure why Allen and Heath didn't make this a ZEDi6 and give the user USB support other than to be cheap I guess but looking at the ZEDi8 it's the exact same Mixer as the ZED6 only with USB and a source select feature. So for those that want a super budget Allen and Heath this is your prime choice but for those on a budget that want "Features" over brand name than without hesitation you want a MackieProFX.                
I bought this to replace a little Behringer Xenyx802. Fairly easy to use, good size & solid controls. This is a good mixer for simple recordings. Everything seems to function properly. Only complaint is no drivers for Windows 10, but I contacted A&H and recieved a reply quickly stating that the driver for Win 10 should be released shortly. Also, this unit has a grounded plug so use a quality grounded power outlet. Theres a little bit of noise but not bad.                
This thing has more transient noise than my old Behringer Xenyx also no driver support for Windows 10 yet. Direction booklet is lack-lustre and vague. Definitely disappointed.                 
Sounds incredible, really sturdy, expanded what I can do in a rehearsal studio, allowed me to start a mobile recording operation. Works with logic, protools, abelton, garageband...you name it. Great price too. 10/10                 
I was a picky pain in the butt and the people at zZounds were patient and through a couple of return/exchange situations, they were professional and helpful all along. The product? Ableton Push2 turned this long time MPC user to a full on Ableton enthusiast. Get IT!                
This piece was recommended to me, and a Vocalist / Guitarist, who wanted to do more with my music. It took me awhile as the thought of learning a daw unline others I have used, and essentially learning a new instrument. For me, I took a couple of master classes online to get the ball rolling. Amazing device.                 
It doesn't synthesize any sound.                 
All of the features are useful, however sometimes it's a little confusing to switch layout modes, but I'm sure that is s learning curve that will come in time. 
I'd like the step sequencer to be a tad different, but it is to hard to explain.                 
Everything is pretty idiot proof...it's designed very well and easy to understand.                 
All parts of this device seems solid and durable.                 
Yeah, it's a little expensive, but it's totally worth it...it's total quality all the way around.                 
I have not had any interactions with Ableton concerning this device.                 
It's designed very well, and is basically a hardware interface of the software. You can move and manipulate anything in the fraction of the time it would take with a mouse. Idea's are easily implemented.                
First off, this thing is built like a tank! It's not constructed of cheap plastic that a lot of other controllers are made with. The shell is very solid, and sleek. 
The buttons are almost flush with the body, and have a solid *click* when pressed. They feel like they have a durable rubber diaphragm over 'em that block out the excess led light from the crisp illuminated font.
The knobs are VERY touch sensitive, and is easy to accidently touch while adjusting other parameters. Other than that, they too are very solid and smooth. 
The main pads are brightly lit, and feel of a firm latex that do not hurt or tire out your fingertips. 
The main display is brilliant and crisp! Parameters are shown in real-time  (even when automated) with no bleed over effect. It maintains its illumination for hours without any power dimming.
**I was confused as to why white track labels show up as yellow on the display, but this is intentional due to the color white being dedicated for selections and such**
Overall, this thing is a beast of a controller that seriously speeds up the process of laying down ideas so you don't lose any creativity. 
I should have purchased this sooner. My production work is so much more easier now that I have this.                
The first thing i noticed about the controller when I first unboxed it was the weight of it! It was really sturdy, built with strong heavy components. Ive owned the Maschine and mpc studio, the push 2 blew those out of the water! I mainly produce Hip-hop, Idk why the hip hop community isnt making such a big buzz about this. I retired my Maschine, studio and MPC1000.                
I have owned and still own several pad controllers, and the Ableton Push 2 by far has become my favorite one to use with Ableton Live. It just fits like a glove simply a no brainer when using the two. It will speed up your workflow, and allow you to not have to constantly stare at a computer screen. The pads are very responsive, much better the the previous version, the color screen  makes it easy on the eyes, and it is pretty muted synced with all the controls with the instruments and effects in Ableton Live. It's also very easy to sample and edit with, and learning how to record melodies and chords is very easy.                
I would like to say I want to give this a 5-star rating because the controller is the best of all controllers I've ever used and therefore it's just simply the best review  so if it was me and I was recommending it to anyone in the industry or beginner or immediately I would say purchase 2                 
I've been using Ableton Live as my main DAW for about 2 years now, so I decided to pick up the Ableton Push 2. There's a bit of a learning curve, but once you get past that.. This machine is a BEAST! I can honestly play around with it and be on it for hours without noticing how much time has passed!                 
It took me a while to come around to Ableton live. I was using MPC and REASON but now I'm strictly Ableton and use MPC and REASON as plugs in Ableton. Also i got and app that lets me control Reason with the PUSH 2!!  THE Push 2 isn't touch screen but i can come up with ideas so quick with it and Ableton!!! The only thing its missing is a built in audio interface for traveling.... if it had that it would be 5stars in my book!                
The sound produced by the Access Virus Ti is forthright, powerful, rich, and honest.  There are no strange anomalies present in any of the sounds it produces.  The synthesizer is a wonderful piece to have and adds bright, powerful sounds to any mix.  Impressive.                
There are the usual suspects as far as oscillators, filters, and patches.  The factory presets are some of the best I've heard.  I was pretty amazed by that.  Looks like the engineers behind this thing love it enough to play with it and add to it's banks.  Didn't give this thing a 10 because Access, as of yet, has not released a x64 bit version of Total Integration--this is a major issue.                
Very intuitive.  It will be up and running on a DAW or as a standalone instantly after installation and configuring of your hardware.                
Out of the box it is a wonderfully crafted piece of equipment.  Feels good to the touch and has lots of pulsing lights that grab your attention.  Loudest little synth light show I have in my studio.                
Easily worth the coins you spend.  When you look at this thing after you give it the first go around you will probably realize that it's here (in your studio) to stay.                
The people at Access are excellent; again, the only problem I have is no support of x64 bit operating systems.  This is very essential for those of us who use lots of instances of plug-ins and utilize rigs boasting more than 3.2gb of good RAM.  I can not overstate this.  Sorry, no 10 for the team until this issue is resolved.                
The knobs are sturdy and feel good to the touch and to the turn.  The pulsing lights dance responsively and respectively according to settings.  If you haven't seen one in action, youtube it and watch her flash.                
I decided to get a virus because I am a firm believer in the power of computer music.  The 'total integration' schema was very attractive.  Access provides frequent updates and a few popular electronic musicians provide custom banks for downloading.  I will use this thing for years to come.  I want to just bury myself in it's sounds and produce music where the Virus is in charge of all leads; I suppose I could experiment like this for a year or so. I do this just so I can truly survey what she can do.                
Where to begin?  How about HOLY CRAP this Synth rocks!  For starters there's probably thousands of patches and I still haven't heard all of them.  The TI2 completely replaced my 1010lt sound card.  I have the Whiteout edition and the color of the led lights add extra flare to the amazing sound on this keyboard.                
The really great part for me was the virtual instrument plug-in, it quickly installed in my Sonar 8.5 and took the work load off my PC!                  
Yep its a steep learning curve (at least for me) but you have complete control with 32 knobs and 43 buttons that help you manipulate your sound.                
Built like a tank!                
I sometimes think I paid to much but then I start cheating on my Virus with another synth and it just doesn't feel the same at all.  The Virus just feels solid compared to synths in its price range. Buttons, knobs and just the frame alone feels better made.                
Not only do I have the TI2 white Edition but I also have the Access Virus A and I haven't had any problems so I guess that's good for support.                 
I have to admit that the pulsating Virus logo in the back of the keyboard is kind cool.                 
If you are serious about your music and would like a synth I would recommend just saving you money and buying an Access Virus TI2 .                  
bar none ...  best synth on the planet i own the snow and full ti.    love them  ,more than  my  dave smiths and se-1x                
more                
bit  of a learning curve but pretty intuitive !!                
I've had the TI2 Polar for six months now, and I use it every day.  I bought it as an upgrade from a Virus B.   It's definitely similar to the older Virus line with some pretty awesome features.  I'm coming at this from a Linux user perspective so I can't really speak to the Total Control Integration point of view, that is unfortunately a Windows or Mac only piece of software.  I run it exclusively as a midi only box, although I occasionally use the USB in/out as an audio capture device.
The sound on the synth is definitely the selling point for me, especially with the updates like wave tables and arp to mod matrix support.  This is a pretty amazing synth engine in it's own right  and adding a keyboard just makes you want to play on it all the time.  The construction is very sturdy, the knobs feel like they will last quite a while, the weight of it makes the smaller size easily giggable.  I've also instilled a lot of lust in my friends playing synths like the Moog Voyager, so I would say it fares well even though it's virtual analog.
For me the key pros were:  
* Fantastic sounds and effects for every midi channel
* Easily sculpt sounds from the hardware interface
* Integrated keyboard
* More DSP = more sounds
* Great training videos, however they should post more of them.
* Support on the forums is actually pretty nice, a little digging pulls up a lot of great information.
Main Cons:
* The total control is supposed to be very stable now, however may still require tinkering.  Since there is no VST only version of the software, and I am on Linux, it is really only possible to use it like the original Virus B.
* The manuals are not clear, you need to read several versions only to discover you need to read the original TI manual - there is no TI2 specific manual other than the quick start.  They expect you to read the manual from the Total Control help.
* Even with the extra DSP I managed to bog the synth down using it as a drum module.  Each note is very short with no long decays, and yet I maxed out with 7 patches fairly easily.  Most were simple drum sounds.  That being said there are lots of tricks for getting a lot more out of the DSP, I was using premade sounds that weren't really optimized for multi-timbral playing.
* Some parameters are now buried with the Shift button, which can make tweaking those parameters a little harder to tweak while also playing.
* Vocoder is nicely complex, which made it hard to get a useful sound out.  Documentation is slim, but I finally worked out they have a bunch of presets for a reason.
* Knobs work when using it as a generic midi controller, but buttons don't.
* Web site was often glitchy and hard to download updates from.  
It's still USB 1, and running any other devices on the same port may cause glitching.
Overall though, if you make a point of thinking of this as an amazing sounding piece of hardware and you take the time to learn the hardware interface, it will pay off.  If you are trying to use the Total Control software, your millage may vary considerably.  I wouldn't view the Total Control as the main selling point.                
The clarity that it offers is a revelation. It puts you in the game for creating really great recordings.                
HMX and IRON are so good that they offer a different option if you need different preamp flavors on top of the ones you have. If you've invested in different pres for your studio this may be an unexpected treat.                
It's as easy as can be. I use Studio One DAW and Control Two in UAD and it recognized it immediately. Audient has a great but underated reputation. It's a major win for all enthusiasts.                
This thing is a tank. It may last longer than me lol. Really thought it is one of the best built pieces of rack gear I've seen in a while.                
In it's catagory it's a little more expensive but you end up with an extension that is worth far more.                
With their reputation I don't suspect that I would need it but I've heard nothing but good things in that department.                
The sound is the wow.                
Perfect addition to to any adat input. I have a UAD Duo and I could not ask for a better setup.                
I have had other beginner audio interfaces and the iD14 sounds and records beautifully. 
Pros: Setup and install was a breeze. I'm a techy type of a guy so I always check manufacturer website for the most up to date drivers and software. If you are a guitarist the direct input on this thing is killer. Recording my cheap little Fender squire never sounded so clear. I compared my cousin's 1st Gen Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 guitar input to this and the Guitar/D.I. on the Audient is much better. My vocal recordings from my Oktava MK318 non modded has also changed allowing me to hear more on the low and high end. The build quality is very sturdy where I'm not afraid if it drops. Visual LED levels are great. Software is simple and easy to use. The dials and switches are very well made.  
Cons: Output gain on headphone jack could be better. I don't think the USB port will last if someone uses this as their main portable audio interface. I say this because it wiggles a little. Besides these two cons, go and buy this thing.                
i had this and id22. i kept this one because it sounded just as good as the id22 but was about half the price. 
i compared the sound of the id14 to my echo audiofire 12, a focusrite scarlet 18i20, and the ad converters in my grace preamp. 
i will say it sounds noticeably better then the echo and the focusrite. i noticed it has a much tighter bass sound and a noticeably wider stereo spread. it made a big difference. it was real and noticeable upgrade.
although i went with the id14 over the id22, i'll say the id22 was also great. i didn't end up needing the extra bells and whistles or extra outputs so i went with the id14. 
also one thing i like better about the id14 over the id22 is that the id14 allows you to use the large volume knob as a software controller. you just put your mouse over something like a volume fader or a pan knob and you can control it with the big knob. pretty cool for small adjustments.
I replaced my Mbox Pro 3 with this interface because the Mbox just gave me issues. I just got the Audient ID14 the other day and being the nerd that I am I hooked it up right away....set up and running in less than 10 minutes. I was curious about the mic pres since everyone seemed to love the way they sounded, so I A/B'd them against my UA Solo 110. Honestly didn't want to accept the fact that the Audient mic pre sounded better. I literally recorded 5 different A/B takes and honest to GOD, the Audient mic pres sound better. It could have something to do with there being no way to bypass the Audient mic pres, but at the end of the day I don't really need the Solo 110 any longer. There is also a noticeable difference in how the music sounds coming out of the speakers....the A/D D/A conversion is top notch and I can hear more detail than when I had the Mbox Pro 3. You get way more than your money's worth with this interface.  btw the mic pres are super quiet!  For $300 you get a great interface, no latency issues, and actual usable really good mic pres. Its a project studio dream come true.                 
First bought Focusrite 2i2 it was nice for the price but buying the Id14 it doesn't compare. Loving the mic pre amp it's quality! You won't find a better one in its price range.                
I have used several interfaces in my life and this one so far has the best quality how can a wayyy older interface like the M- Audio Pro Fire 610 could have a off and on button and this one doesnt? That was a wrong decision made by Audient because you will either decide to keep the phantom power on all the time or plug and unplug all the time..not only it is tedious to do this it can also damage the USB connector which is right next to it..one time I was about to record in Reason and while I was plugging the power cord I just tapped the USB cord with my finger and it made the interface malfunction so I had to restart the pc! not a good look on a card in this caliber when the Focusrite 2i2 that to me its close to this one but not better, has a power button also. To conclude if you dont care about the things I have mentioned you will like the quality as tedious as I made it sound its not a deal breaker.                
I purchased my iD14 14 months ago. Loved it. Read on. 
The other night I went to mix a session and noticed some serious hissing. The Mic 1 input meter was showing a signal even though nothing was attached. When I turned the gain knob on the unit it produced a crackle that I'm surprised my monitors survived. After some back and forth emails with customer service - including a recording of the issue - I was told that the issue was related to hardware and that my only recourse was to have it fixed on my dime - even though I was barely two months outside of the warranty window. While I understand how a warranty works I also understand that leeway is possible when the onus is on the company who manufactures and sells a $300 product - one which I would expect them to stand behind a little more, especially since the failure was no fault of mine.  
My Audient iD14 is now a $300 paperweight. Thanks Audient!                  
I own the Tascam 1608 and the Presonus 1818VSL interfaces, and they both pale in comparison to my ID22.  The output from this interface is more clear and precise than the other two interfaces.  The unit is built solid. The preamps push my SM7B with no problem.  The monitor routing is great as well since I use two sets of studio monitors when mixing.  An overall great interface for the money.                
very high quality unit with a sturdy build. it looks cool and is super easy to use. 
the sound is a very noticable improvement over my echo audiofire 12 and my focusrite scarlett 18i20. 
tighter bass, more clarity in the highs, and a wider stereo spread. just a much better sounding interface.                 
This thing is awesome. Only thing I wish it had was more than 8 adat/light pipe channels for expansion. The pres are great ! Gives you a very nice tone when pushed with the right mic. Audient is also top notch when it comes to support.                
The converters and preamps are flawless on this interface. The UI is very user friendly easy to use but has slower latency.                
Great sounding DAC, Awesome sounding preamps, decent latency but on windows the drivers are bad I would rather opt for the RME Babyface Pro if I was on windows and the iD22 if I was on mac.                
Pros: It pretty. Good converters.Cons:Sometimes it has weird output signals from the mic pre. like an offset you can see it in the DAW when you record.1/4 headphone jack just stopped working for no reason. Constantly have to power cycle to get sounds in different programs. Coulda saved myself the headache and got the Focusrite back -_-                
I have 16 of these that I use on a regular basis and couldn't be happier.  They get moved a lot to create different looks so we really abuse them, but the only thing that has even needed attention is the power cord came loose and we had to tighten it down on the inside.  I have 8 on trees, 4 for uplighting and 4 for downward backlighting right now.  I recommend the 6 ch dmx mode to really have fun with the effects like stobing for chases, sound activated mode, etc.  Our stage is 30'deep, 50'wide and 25'tall.  We recentlly added a haze machine to really let these lights shine.  I know the competitors claim they are brighter, but we wouldn't pay more for brightness because these are bright enough and we like the traditional par64 look.                
Great gear at good price. Very Bright and lots of color. Love you can utilize them with or without DMX controller. Would buy and buy and buy again!                
Nothing much to review. Cable is pretty rugged; haven't had it degrade at all and it's been used in various environments (Extreme Hot/Cold, Rain). For the price, great cable.                 
First impression: This thing is big. About 2 feet long, and weights about 20 lbs, so be sure your stand will hold it.Tried it at a small backyard gig and was very impressed at how it covered the entire space very well! I used it without a controller, just reacting to sound, and it was amazing how accurate the movements were in time with the beat. GOBOs are consistent, wash lights cover a big area, and the lasers and derbies were impressive.Comes with an IR transmitter plug for iOS devices, although the documentation mentions nothing about this. I contacted ADJ and had a next-day response explaining about the free Airstream IR app and how you can control the box with the app and the little transmitter.Overall, I love this unit! It is a little heavy, and finding a suitable case for it might be a challenge, but I love this light. Great for new DJs on a budget (like me).                
Used this in the back of the van during this years Christmas Parade Season. The kids loved it,! But be warned the bubble juice does get on everything near the machine. And the remote worked well along with the amount of bubbles produced. All in all, it was a BIG HIT!                
This is it folks if you do not have a clue on DMX please do several of the you tube videos to learn and understand what DMX is and how to apply it. If you don't know how to calculate the dip switch codes there's several free phone apps that will do it for you.                 
They have no sound they are very quiet. In fact, thy are so quiet I don't know they are there half the time.                
The best feature is the stands. They are proprietary, but at least they safely go up in the air quite a ways. We regularly have to have them to the side of a stage and haven't had any trouble getting them to the hight we need. They are very sturdy and so much better than the Chauvet disposables.                
Very easy to use. Adj actually took the time to list a menu screen you can actually read and understand. Instead of some unreadable mess like the 4 bar.                
Seriously well built. Heavy duty and good craftsmanship. Name with a heavy duty power cable that will actually reach a plug on the ground. A very welcome touch. Hint, hint chauvet. FYI we run a small for hire sound company so we are using these under different circumstances every week.                
The value of this product far exceeds the price. It is the same price as the 4 bar and offers the luminosity of the 4 bar tri. Not too mention far more features.                
I have had to deal with the manufacturer twice, both times I was totally impressed. The company actually set up the tech with the system I have so he could,better understand my issue, he took time to know my name and used it. Highly impressed.                
Hey look really nice and being a single bulb unit look like a small par can. Many of the people I work with have positively commented on that. I get a lot of.. Did you get new lights? I really like them type compliments.                
I needed to replace my Chauvet 4 bar with something brighter. I was going to buy the newer 4 bar tri and then I saw these. These lights regardless of cost blow the standard 4 bar out of the water. The colors are more vivid, and the whites while not pure, are believable enough.                
I just sold my old big and bulky 64 pars. These lights are compact,easy to set up and have great colors. Highly recommend them. Going to buy another set this year.                
These lights are very bright and very versatile! The fact they are dmx controled and also have lighting programs built in to the unit makes this a set and forget light system. I got so many compliments about these lights. Thank you zzounds and ADJ!                
I love these lights. They are as bright as the old Par 56 cans I used to have and draw only a fraction of the wattage. The cases are what they are, cheap cloth bags. I built some new road cases out of wood and glued the Styrofoam and velvet inserts from inside the bags inside the wood cases. The zipper broke right out of the gate on the cheap bags. The lights will last much longer in the wood road cases.                
I purchased this bag to house 4-Chauvet EZ par 64 RGBA fixtures and 4-Slim Par 64 RGBA fixtures . Excellent choice I am able to also fit my cords in the bag with some room to spare.  You can also easily fit 10 to 12 chauvet slim par 56 fixtures in this bag with cords.Can''t go wrong with this bag.                
I bought this bag for some off-brand pars, and it's really a solid bag. The pars I have are a bit larger, so I can only fit 6, but no complaints here.                
I bought the Adj Fog Fury and used it as I was DJing at a bar. People were complaining about the horrible smell that the machine was emitting. It smelled like something burning. So after a few people complained I stopped using it. Over New Years I decided to use it again and the same results. People could not stand the smell and requesters that I not use it! I’m truly dissatisfied with the Fog Fury machine. I will never use it again! I did purchase the recommended ADJ fluid!                
Awesome fog machine. Throws a TON of fog, very fast. nice colors however you cannot use the colors unless the fog is going, at least not that I've found. The owners manual says you cannot, so I stopped trying. Not the biggest deal unless you are looking for a very specific color at a very specific time (which is why I gave it 4 stars under the features category). Like any other high output fogger, it will have a little noise while you are dispensing fog, but I've found the best solution to that is to turn up the music (the reason for the 4 stars in the sound category). Its pretty quiet when not dispensing a cannon blast of fog. Overall I love this thing. I want another one, just so I can have each side of my set up match....no one will ever see me again if I do this...there is seriously THAT much fog. Videos DO NOT do this thing justice. It looks awesome in videos, but even more amazing live....like pyrotechnics without the heat.                 
This machine is awesome! Strong output and good colors. Kind of loud when set off due to the amount of pressure to push the fog out, but runs quiet when in the heating stage. Very easy to set up and use. Remote control has 4 options (which I'm told can be customized, but I simply use the preset colors). and has good range. Good size fogger juice tank and doesn't seem to use a lot. 
Unfortunately, after about 3 nights of usage (about 15 hours of use), it began to go off on it's own without pushing the button and if the button was pushed it would continue spraying even after the button was released. The return was easy - they emailed me a label and as soon as they received confirmation it was on it's way, they shipped a replacement to me. Although a hassle, with the quick turn around time, I shouldn't be without it.                
This is by far the best "vertical" fogger I have seen and used. The fog stream is instant and powerful.  I get a great crowd response when I blast this thing
There is a loud "steam" sound when they are producing fog. It is similar to noise from a CO2 effect.                  
Light is good not what I expected maybe once use it a few times need help in getting different gobo screens and a way to get your own logo made to project                
I own 3 Haze generators which put out 1,000 CFM each so I can spread dispersions. I use one on each side of the stage and one in the middle of the stage pointing outwardly. This is not fog and the reviewer probably don’t know much about haze. There’s no heater, so it doesn’t produce humidity to a rom like fog. Better hang time. And clear almost which is better for photos and filming. This is made for the ADJ Hazer no other machine! One gallon last for ever, I usually charge my Coustomer for a gallon in my price. Kinked what you’re talking about when you make a review!                
Product is ok was expecting a little more output with the haze and price was a little high. Really not satisfied with this product                
At 1,000 cubic ft. Per minute it's like a good companion it puts out. My DJ company now doing event Production have been called on by music video companies to provide Lighting and haze. As on the Voice and American Idol haze is used to show excellent beams in your lighting and great for cameras. Warning don't try substitute fluids they don't work good and can clog the unit. AMDJ of Haze G fluid is $39.00 but is much more efficient and has longer hang time than fog Machines.I love it so much I bought 2 for bigger halls. Even though there's no Dmx control I hook them into my Light Copilot setup and simply turn them on or off with long extension cords. E so no Are no heaters or warm up time .                
Fog machines cloud up the stage, plus foggers use heaters which actually are burning fumes, which means you are actually breathing in smoke! These Hazers use no heater. It simply blows air from a compressor into the fluid chamber and instantly creates a mist instead of smoke. Spoke to doctor about it and said it's better for your lungs than a fog machine. Makes light beams shine through yet no cloud which often hides band members closest to the fog machine. As mentioned before, great for pics! Similar hazers are used on theater stages. 4 stars on value because a little pricey but worth it!                
Have used this product every week since I purchased , to highlight our Bands light show, easy to use,effective results, Especially with photographers very little use of juice,good highlighting of lightbeams,a little pricey ,but worth the few extra dollars .and thanks to zZounds' Play as You Pay makes it even better I highly recamend this product                
This worked out very well for an image i needed to project on to a dance floor from a light truss. If your using a 10ft truss your good to go.You need about 10ft to 15ft in the air to get a good size image because i find it limited on zooming. Very bright and easy to adjust. You have to use metal gobos but i guess your trading off the quality of brightness with a cheaper model to use plastic. Guest were very impressed with the image in fact they snapped photos of it all night long. These detailed touches really make a huge difference on these gigs i highly recommend. Lightweight and low profile ...what else can i say. My first experience using zZounds and it wont be my last ......your payment service and shipping times are amazing!!                
I bought this light as an upgrade from the ADJ GOBO LED that didn't have a zoom. This light paid for itself the 1st time I used it. 32w LED was very bright, focus and the zoom was a plus. great for Wedding GOBOs and more.                
These lights are amazingly perfect for mobile DJ or clubs looking for compact size with powerful effects for a small to medium space. I used two in 4800 sq ft ballroom and had a awesome light show that the party loved when pair with strobes and color fading pars!                
Product arrived on time, just a few days after I ordered it. As a first time buyer at this site, i'm very impressed. I took advantage of the installment plan which is really great! I can "Play as I Pay"! Gonna buy more products from zZounds soon! The product is compact and lightweight, but has nice features. Light output is strong enough for small to medium sized clubs and venues. Easy to setup.                
I'm a mobile DJ and use this light as my centerpiece on my truss.  Its a cool light, nice effects, sound activated mode, DMX mode, changes directions, nice colors.  It's a great addition to your lighting.  In addition to the great product, I buy 90% of my gear the zZounds.  Customer service, timeliness, etc., is second to none.                  
This stand is a very affordable choice.  The weight rating isn't a lot (100 pounds) but for hanging some LED pars up high (12') it can't be beat.  It seems to be made of a little thinner material than some of the more expensive stands, but for my uses, it works great!                
A slight whirring sound - nothing bad.                
Appears to be a nice bundle - yet, the light included would barely be of use in a small bedroom.                
To get a decent effect - well, it's not possible with the light included.                
Everything seems okay in terms of construction - not great, simply okay - the included light is near useless (have I mentioned that yet?).                
Needed a mirrorball and motor anyway.. the package is okay - just not really effected out of the box.                
Did no contact them, assume they may be okay.                
Like a chipmunks fart compared to the Big Bang.. it's Wow.. but inverted.                
Need several mirror balls, thought I'd give two of these a try with the included light.. in all fairness the mirrorball and motor will probably be okay - however the included light is far too dim.                
this is hot item                
Coupled with the Obey 40 these lights are great! Bright enough to cover a good size stage with just 4 of them... The UV light is not as bright as the rest but will still shine a smaller stage say 12x12 or so. Fast response, lite enough to be able to mount other lights on our light bar. Only thing I wish is that zZounds would process payments faster!!! It takes forever for them to process a 4 pay payment!                
Lots and lots of light. Had a community event at a park that I needed some extra late for. And these guys did the job wonderfully.                
ive only tried one of the lights. i do have to say the UV light is awsome and they are super bright. im planning on buying many MANY more!                
These O-Clamps are listed as a "recommended accessory" for an Odyssey Truss System listed here on zZounds (search for item ODYLTMTS8) but these clamps are NOT compatible with that truss. 
That truss has 1.0-inch pipes, but these O-Clamps are only designed for use with 1.5-inch or 2.0-inch trusses.
At the time I purchased the ODYLTMTS8 truss, the product description did NOT specify the pipe size, so I assumed, if the 1.5-inch O-Clamps were listed on this site as a "Recommended Accessory" they must be the right ones.  It was disappointing when they arrived, and they didn't fit.  Since zZounds doesn't sell 1.0-inch clamps, they did refund me, but I ate up about half the refund shipping these back to them... and then I had to go elsewhere to find the correct size O-Clamps.
I'm not complaining to get attention, but I just want to make sure anyone else looking to purchase the same combo if items doesn't make the same mistake.                
I have about 8 of these clamps and they work, you have to make sure you are using them for the right size pipe, and be care full when loosening the wing nut, if you go to far everything falls off, make putting up lights quick and easy. with 1.5-2" pipe these clamps can hold lights at an angle without damaging your pipe.                
Color mixing projected in a object....fantastic. Color mixing projected on a mirrorball......not so much. I was hoping that this would mix colors well for a cool custom color effects for weddings. But when this is projected on a mirror ball each individual LED (RGBW) can be seen on the reflections on dance floor and room. Think I would have done better to get a white led pinspot and insert colored gels to get the effect I was looking for with this fixture.                
Excellent product especially the extra USB connections on my MacBook Pro I Have only 1 usb other one was defective I connected the pow-r bar to the only USB port, hooked up my ddj sx external drive and charged my phone, no surges, no dropouts,using Serato DJ pro turntables came up with no issues, worked like a charm highly recommended.                
Really nice lights. Don't really know how to work them, but they serve the purpose.                
This light is super bright and is perfect as a Centerpiece Light. I would recommend putting two of them together to get an even larger effect.                
Great light all around. If it wasn't a moving light I most likely would not have paid this much for it. Since it does move you can use it for so many applications. I use it for up lighting, dj'ing and live stage. I love the fact that each light can be independtly programmed unlike having ALL the lights linked together. I use it with mxdmx 1.0 and usually would program on mode 3 (35 Channels) or mode 4 (39) channels. The light has pretty quick action for its size and is pretty bright. Depending on the color, the lights beams do not shoot out straight. As it switches colors so does the beams angle. To most people this is small but it really depends on how anal you want to be. Overall the light is very easy to use and really adds to a show. It looks great vertically, horizontally, or even diagonal. Another good thing is the size and weight of this light. For what it puts out, its a nice compact size. The light is pretty light weight and doesn't take up a lot of room which is nice. The light is also pretty quiet as well. If you work with mydmx, just contact ADJ to get the profile and they send it right away. Definitely love working with the support because it is USUALLY a good experience. Hopefully that doesn't change.                
As a big lighting guy I'm surprised these big companies sell this light. It's so heavy that it's a fall and fire hazard. I returned mine because had intermittent issues out of the box. Warmed up and working this light throws off less light the $99 ADJ LED. Bar.                
I Purchased the snow flurry machine through Walmart online order for a charity function.  We hung the machine the night before to get an idea of where to place it for the perfect snow flurry and the machine did not work and in the haste of the party the box was displaced so we cannot return it. What a complete disappointment and  waste of money.  Do not purchase this machine buy a different brand.  I will update this review if the company was willing to make this right.                 
These are amazing. Quick movements, very bright, and very reasonable. I highly recommend them.                
I've had the VMS2 for about two months, have used it at several gigs, and it has worked great!!! I'm using windows 7 and have not had any problems. Really easy to use. Also to the play as you pay plan from zZounds is a big plus!!!                
It is durable. The Virtual DJ version that comes with this is out dated. Doesn't seem compatible with windows 7. and the resolution doesn't work well with my screen size.   
Also I can't seem to change the key of the tracks with this one like you can with other virtual DJ versions                
Very sturdy, professional case with padding to protect equipment. First drawback is that the case is slightly oversized for the advertised product, so the VMS doesn't fit snug (sides) in the case. Not such a big deal. The bigger issue is with the laptop shelf. It's not a slide shelf, but a flip shelf and it sits too far back on the case. The laptop sits then way too far back on the shelf, which makes visibility an issue, especially for smaller laptops. I need to pull my touchscreen laptop way forward on the shelf in order to be able to touch the screen comfortably without too much stretching. The one good thing about having to do this is that it allows for ample room behind the laptop on the shelf for external drives. Case is well worth if for the price ad it was delivered to me as advertised.                
It's a case no sound...The only sound you will hear are the compliments at the professional look of the case.                
It's a case no features...It's sturdy and looks nice...The flip part for the laptop is nice and can handle any laptop. I have a 17 in hp and it has plenty room for it. The picture for the case make the laptop holder look small. Although the case was not designed to hold a mixer and a laptop. My 17in hp fits comfortably in the case with the mixer in it and does not move. I would not put a thin laptop in it.                
Just put your mixer in it...No instructions needed                
It's sturdy and looks nice                
This case is worth every penny. I've seen other cases almost double the price of zzound...                
None Needed                
The Case is nice. Give you a professional look...                
As long as I don't get a new mixer I will use this one.                
I recently bought this case along with the control deck. It is well built and sturdy. I think it's price right for what you get. The only problem I have with it is the flip part that the laptop sits on. For me, once you flip over the stand, then it sits too far back "behind" the deck. I wish it was a bit more over the top of the deck towards the back and a bit higher up. Once you flip open your laptop screen then you kinda have to lean towards it to see properly if you have a small font. Other than that, pretty decent product.

I bought this bag to carry differant items and the size of the bag worked great                
NA                
The quality of the bag was very good                 
I bought the bag and it fit my needs very well. Great and well worth the money                
I have not needed support yet                
NA                
I would buy this again as long as the price was the same                
This is my first dmx controller. I've used a relay package before, but this controller has taken me to the next level. 16 fixtures (or countless if multiple fixtures have the same dmx address and channel) can be controlled with this fixture, and each fixture has 32 channels! The 480 scenes are awesome too! I personally have a set set-up for my weddings vs. my parties! With this many scenes, I can have elegant light shows for my weddings, and High energy light shows for parties! This many scenes also help when having greek shows ! Each greek can have custom lighting with their associate greek colors!It's just so much that can be done with this fixture! I'm still learning and love every minute of use with it.                
These sound great and for the price i was shocked how they sound! They are very durable!                
These are my first pair of monitors that I have ever owner, before this I use my Audio-Technica headphone that work great, but needed something more detailed and less fatiguing. Got more then I paid for with these speakers, I feel like I can produce as long as I wish to, and not stop because of being fatigued by the sound. Super detailed, you can hear every aspect of the mix, and plenty of bite and punch. The Sub7 is more than loud enough, if you are a bedroom producer like me, this setup is more than enough; it is LOUD! I have yet to even push it to anywhere near it volume limits, and it is plenty of loud the level I play it, and still stays detailed even when you play it very low. I highly recommend this, I will always buy Adam Audio after owning these.                 
My whole way of mixing and listening changed onceIi set these up in my studio. For a compact setup the sound is big and wide, the sub adds dimension and depth. It even has a remote for the sub.Great value and service from zZounds.                
For monitors (pair) under 1k, I have a hard time believing there's a better sounding option on the market available today.  After breaking them in, the sound in the sweet spot is pure butter.  The low end has a lot of mixed reviews, but I'm here to tell you, they won't disappoint you. Tight bass, truthful mids, silky highs.... needless to say I'm happy as hell to own these.                
The room correction features on the back are great.  The front loaded bass ports in front are nice for small studios with bass trap issues.                
Plug and play, correction features are self explanatory.  Need to break them in though to get true audio clarity.                
My first Adam Audio experience, but their reputation procedes themselves well.  Worth every penny!!!                
Maybe a little high, but if you want to take the next step in monitors from entry level, these puppies are sweet.                
No experience yet                
Bo Derek sex appeal for sure.  Everyone wants to tell their friends, "Hey come check out my Adam monitors"                
Really happy I didn't settle for lessor and cheaper monitors on the market, I'll keep these for near fields for a long time.  A very accurate, honest monitor system.                
Highs are crystal clear and precise with lows that are solid and full (not boomy or boxy). Stereo imagining is perfect. Before these monitors I was mixing/mastering using Grado225 headphones. The Grado's are good but these monitors really allow me to dial in much more low end and retain clarity in my mixes.                 
I like the front ported bass ports and the individual adjustments on the back are very useful for tuning the speakers for my less-than-optimal studio space.                 
Connecting to my scarlett 6i6 via TRS-XLR cables was pretty easy. Adjusting the dials on the back while cumbersome is something I dont have to do often.                 
fairly heavy and solid.                 
at $1k for the pair I think this is a good value.                 
haven't had to contact the manufacturer yet, but they are on twitter and seem pretty responsive.                 
I was making fine music before I got this product but the addition of solid bass and extremely well defined mid/high and sound stage have been eye opening.                 
Excellent. Well worth the money                
Doesn't matter what kind of music u play on them, they sound beautiful. If your mixing bass heavy music, then you might need a sub or just cross reference your mixes until you get a feel for how the bass sounds on bigger systems.they definitely let you know how the the mid-bass to upper ranges mix together. I mainly use them for mixing hip hop/rap songs but I would feel confident mixing any type of audio on them.                
I’ve been recording electronic music almost 20 years as I’ve been through all of the “great for the price” monitors up to the entry level big boys and these bad boys here are the real deal. Nothing colored. Great presence in the mid field and the sub is very easy to use and properly adjust for your setup. I went from a house to an apartment and previously used the VXT6 with KRK sub 10s and to be brutally honest the difference here is staggering. The only comparable monitors I’ve heard at this range are the dynaudio bm5a series I had years ago. Buy these monitors!! zZounds pay plans are BEAST! NO INTEREST GUYS AND GALS!!!                
I have to start by thanking the knowledgable sales person at zZounds.  I really had no idea what I wanted or needed.  I sold a pair of Yamaha HS8's and a HS8 sub.  Those monitors were to big and took up to much space, the sound quality was okay but nothing to write home about.  After making my TRS balanced cables, I put the monitors on top of the isolation mounts my salesperson suggested.  When I turned them on it was incredible.  No more uncontrollable booming bass, just crystal clear sound that was amazing to both listen to and mix with.  I stayed up until 4 am this morning still playing with my monitors.  At nearly 60 years old, not much gets me that excited but these guys did it to me.  Thank you zZounds for having quality people who are able to make educated decisions.  I hope you let them know that their jobs are truly important.  Without my guy's help I don't know what I would have purchased.                  
I am not a professional producer.  These are for my in home DAW.  I am very pleased with them and I am sure these will be the last monitor speakers I ever have to buy.                
Very simple to operate.  I like the On/Off switch being on the front instead of the back like my pair of Roland monitors.                
VERY well made.                
They are pricey but I think worth the costs as they will last me decades.                
No opinion yet as they are new.                
I've used Tannoy, Focal,  and Mackie HR824.  Mackie was by far my favorite until I heard these!  I wish I would've gotten the A8x but the clarity is UNMATCHED!!!  Also the ribbon tweeter is GREAT for long mix sessions.  I'll add the Adam Sub8 and the very SLIGHT loss of bass response should be more than compensated.  CLEANEST monitors I've heard for under $3,000 yet!                  
crisp precise highs, warm mid and detailed great lows , very impressed                
love the ribbon tweeter                 
very well made,                 
worth the price, have had the krks rockit 8 and the m-audio bx8, these are worth the extra money                
This sound is amazing. Unfortunately, I dont own these, but I do go down into the school's studio and hook up my interface, and play my projects on these babies. The sound is amazing. The overall quality is superb. These are truly the best monitors I've ever heard (i.e, the price tag).                
So far, it has been extremely easy to use. Just hook it up to my interface and we're good to go. Simple as that.                
The quality is amazing. The sound is crisp, everything is clear, and stunning.                
This product is definitely worth it's price tag (even though I would love for it to be cheaper)                
I havent had any problems with it thus far, so i've never had to call customer service or anything.                
If I could afford these monitors, I'd buy them in a heartbeat. I go to the studio and hook them up to my audio interface and from there on, i'm truly blown away. There are truly the sexiest monitors i've seen or heard (despite my infatuation with the KRK Rokit line).                
These monitors are amazing. There's nothing else to say that would can explain it better than that. They are amazing.                 
I am primarily a Rap/HipHop Producer, I make Beats, Record Vocals and Mix & Master.
I started out with a set of the KRK 5's gen 1, then i added a set of the yahmaha 5's, then i added a set of Gen 2 KRK rokit 8's, and now i have the A8X's.
there was a transitional period for me when i made the switch from the rokit 8's to these. the amount of detail in the sound is awsome, it's not a pleasuring type thing, but more what u need to hear. 
the ribbon tweeters deff help not fatigue your ears over long sessions, i use my adams 7 days a week 10-14 hrs a day and my mixes are the same threw the whole day. 
my current setup is the A8X's and the yahmaha 5's, in between the 2 sets, i feel pretty much set. 
i recommend these monitors for sure, there are many options at this price point, but you will have to search outside of guitar center/zzounds, but these monitors are A+++
and just to clarify on the "Port Noise" rumor, the only time i get the port noise is when my bass isnt mixed yet and is too loud, so basically if you get the noise, its because your not doing something right.                
Absolutely awesome!! I've owned and heard some pretty impressive subwoofers in my time, the Sub12's are in my opinion one of the best I've heard in quite some time. I'm using mine in a home theater setup it has a very visceral bottom end response is quite fast not sloppy or bloated. Over all performance was not impacted to huge degree by placement, at least not in my room. I tucked it in a corner of the front wall about a foot from the left side and rear walls and dialed it in.
**NOTE** I only gave 1 star for "Manufacturer Support" because I have not had a need to contact the manufacturer and that field could not be left black or N/A.                
I've owned a pair of Yamaha HS8 Studio Monitors for over 3 years, I liked them, and they were the best in the price range at the time when it came to delivering accurate sound and clarity across every frequency range. When I heard Adam came out with a new line of monitors in the same price range, I though I would give them a try considering Adam Audio's reputation.
I am so glad I did, the t7v's offer the same frequency response as the Yamaha HS8 in the low end despite being much smaller. Although the ribbon tweeters don't speck out at as high a frequency as Yamaha's dome tweeters, the Adams pull through with enhanced clarity that surely beats every other speaker below $350. In fact, the only speakers I've heard that were clearer in the highs had to have been the KEF LS50.
The low end is super tight, much tighter than the HS8 and the high end, while not as airy, is extremely accurate and again, much tighter than the Yamaha's. These monitors are smaller than I expected, and pack a pretty gnarly punch, especially in the 70Hz - 150Hz range. They do 40Hz content extremely well considering how amazingly clear the mids are.
The internal amp is noisier than the Yamaha's and the speaker needs considerably more signal to drive it than the Yamaha's. I did side by side tests for hours between the two speakers, and always found I had to turn up the gain significantly for the Adams when both speakers were set to 0 on the back. Though it's not too noisy, the white noise coming from the tweeter is noticeable if you're looking for it, the Yamaha's handled this much better.
The woofer is very stiff, which is a good thing in my opinion. It seems to need more power to actually push the speaker, and being so much more rigid than the Yamaha's I guess is what gives this speaker the premium sound.
The clarity is amazing in the highs! The Yamaha's high end, while nice, could be grading after a while - the Yamaha's also weren't as clear as these. I have been listening to the Adams all day at all volumes and haven't gotten tired of hearing them yet. I can hear details in percussion (especially sizzly sounds like shakers, cymbals, and hats) that were previously covered by slight distortion and a relatively sloppy tweeter. The Yamaha's high end sounded smeared in comparison.
These do bass so much better than the Yamaha's as well. The clarity in the very low end is present even at low volumes! With the Yamaha's I felt like the roll of started well before the advertised 38Hz, with these I can hear 40Hz bass guitar and 808s very clearly at all volumes. I've said many times that these speakers are tight, the low end, which was sloppy on the Yamaha's in comparison, is no exception. It is a pleasure to listen to bass on these speakers.
The options for room trim aren't very helpful as there's only a +/- 2dB shelf on the high and low. The gain knob doesn't snap to 0, additionally the only markings on the gain knob are -60dB, 0dB, and +18dB. Not very helpful when trying to fine tune my listening position. The "on" indication light is on the back of the speaker for some reason. Some people may like this, I do not, but if it helps drive the price down to only $250, then I'm good with it.
These are excellent speakers. I am selling my Yamaha's immediately.                
I had to send my Focals in to have them repaired, that had a slight noise issue in the amplification. I needed some affordable monitors to fill in until they got back from repair. With ADAMS rep I knew that the affordable T7V's would probably be a good standby backup pair. Was I wrong! These are pretty serious monitors unheard of in their price range! Nice pristine highs. The low end is smooth and is rich.  Bass instruments sound nice. I actually heard things in my previous recordings that i had not heard before...not just in the high end because of the ribbon tweeter... but the low end as well. The stereo image sounds wonderful... much like my Focals. I could close my eyes and hear the the depth of a good mastered track.  For $500 a pair you can't go wrong. Are there better speakers out there....yes! However... get ready to spend over $1,500.00 a pair to get them. These are a good value for the price. The ADAM T7V"s are my new friends... even when I get the Focals back..the T7V's will be getting equal listening time... if not more!                  
I was on Yamahas HS5s for years like a PEASANT, ZERO low end on those but the mids and high are superb. All i wanted was a good low end and 2 track into mixing the T7Vs are absolutely unreal. If you're worried about not having enough low end or power dont worry at all. these are absolutely phenomenal at the price point. ill be buying the next tier up soon to go with these no brainer                
I listen to jazz, west coast mainly Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett, Gerry Mulligan, Snarky Puppy, and these monitors are perfect for this. All I did was plug a RCA to 3.5mm cable into the unbalanced ports in the back of the monitors and control the volume with my phone and I am in heaven!                
With the single RCA input on each monitor I can use a RCA to 3.5mm cable or a Bluetooth DAC to input music from my phone, couldn't get easier.                
These are beautiful, contrary to a couple of reviews, sound fantastic right out of the box and work flawlessly!                
I think these are a bargain compared to Adams other line of speakers. You get the same folded tweeter technology and a poly butyl surround woofer and some super efficient class d amps - what more could you want!                
I'll admit it, I bought (and returned) an Audioengine A2+, S8 package prior to buying these Adam Audio monitors. There is absolutely no comparison between the Audioengine speakers and these Adams. These Adams are clear, crisp, have tight punchy bass - they are everything I was looking for and are less expensive than I originally paid!!                
Honestly, i was blown away after just using them for a day. I use every monitor i could to find the right mix and these fit it. Flat response compared to other monitors. I didnt even have to make adjustments after car or computer play.                 
Bought 2 pair of these 15 years ago and they're still going strong. gone through many sheaths, and tips during that time. through metal, rock and jazz they havent done me wrong except that one time i left them at home and had to play with wooden sticks when i discovered an additional feature. i guess the aluminium ahs some sort of shock absorbing quality bc after that wooden stick gig the wrist forearm pain were off the charts. 5 stars all around                
I bought these sticks not even a year ago. Hardly used them. And I play a Yamaha Electronic drumsset, that have silicone & rubber pads. For the price you pay for these so called sticks, you would think, that they were made better. The grip part of the stick broke inside. Now you can buy the taper covers & the replacement tips all day long, for a good price. But you can't buy the replacement grips, that I know of. I'm not going out and buy a new pair of sticks again for $ 30.00, or more. And to top it all off, you gotta super glue the tips, back on. To me, I rather buy 3 prs. of sticks, instead of one of these poor designed sticks. I just hope other drummers have better luck, than I did. I won't go that route again.                
Seems to have no discernable difference in sound from an average wood stick                
Came with set of replacement sleeves.. Not sure why.. Aluminum shaft snapped in half way before having an opportunty (or need) to replace them.                
UMMMM.. It's a stick.. It's as easy to use as any. I have played 5b sticks for years. Usually Vic Firth american hickory. Had very good experience with Vic Firth sticks. I strongly recommend wrapping these with some stick tape as the aluminum shaft is slippery and you will wear your hands out prematurely trying to hold on to them.                
I'm really not a hard hitter. As I said before. Broke aluminum shaft in half in similar if not less time than I would normally see a wood stick break.                
Just keep buying wood sticks. In the long run, you'll be happier and probably spend less money.                 
Not applicable.. Didn't use support staff                
I wanted it. (emphasis on the ED) After using the sticks for a short time, I really don't feel that they lived up to the "hype".                 
I think I've said too much already.                
overall this drumstick is one the best sticks i've ever used on stage  i tried other types of sticks but i needed something i could have a handle over its light weighted it has a good grip and i never played with such a stick and it also allowd me to play for a very long time and very fast i when you say this drumstick is ahead of time your not messen around it truely when my friends ever need new sticks this is what itell them ro buy THANKYOU AHEAD DRUMSTICKS!!!                
The title says it all. My hard shell cases were shot, and I needed to protect my vintage 1963 Gretch snare without going broke. I made a good choice. Good quality, at a fair price. Thanks zZounds!!!                
I spent weeks reviewing drum cases. I had just bought a set of DW collectors series drums and was very nervous about what I would trust to protect them!! I kept going back to the Ahead case because I loved the zip feature, the thick soft lining and shape of the bag. My biggest concern was would it be tough enough to withstand being banged around from the rigors of gigging?! The answer is yes!! This bag is super tough and seems to be able to withstand as much as a hard case at a much lower price and easier to carry! When you unzip the bag it stands on it's own rather than collapsing like most soft cases. I think it's kinda the best of both worlds! I would def recommend buying this bag!                
These Ahead Armor cases are truly amazing.  You can tell that a lot of thought and effort went into the design, based on real-world conditions for everyday working musicians...and at a ridiculously affordable price.  They are stiff, tough, thickly padded, plushly lined, waterproof and easy to load and unload, thanks to their unique shape and zipper design.  I've tried other bags (and hard cases) over the last 30+ years and nothing else even comes close, in terms of overall quality and ease of use.  One minor recommendation I have to anyone purchasing these is to vacuum out the fleece lining thoroughly before loading your drum inside for the first time, as my drums were covered with a small amount of loose fleece residue after the first time I took them out of the cases.  No big deal...  :-)                
Not required                
True form fit, thick plush padding and tough denier outer layer. Easy zip, with great handles.                
Very easy to use. From putting the drum in to taking them out and carrying them all in between. My load time was cut in half, with the help of these babies.                
These seem to be top quality. Everything looks to be double stitched and well sewn together. This looks as though it could last for years!                
This is well worth it's typical selling price, compared to others I have had in the past.                
Never need them.                
The inside looks to be cozy,comfortable, and safe, which is exactly where I would want my babies to stay during transport.                
These are the best drum bags out there. I have used the Humes and Berg Tuxedo bags. I had to fight with them to get the drums in. Also had to order them a size bigger for the rims mount. The Ahead Armor bags open up and the drum lays right in. Same size as my drums, and no needed help from the bass player to get them in! I LOVE them!                
I like these bags because they are rugged yet plush inside, and easy to open and get your drums in and out of quickly. Since they are bags they are more form fitting and you can get them in spots where hard cases take up too much room. Yet your gear is still protected, and not as heavy to carry around as hard cases.Bottom line is these are really good cases for the money. Armor's website contains good info on how to size your bags and when I emailed their support with a few questions on bags for oversided floor tom mounts they responses were quick and helpful.                
I bought this Bag cos i have custom OCDP 20X22 with 4" extended hoop and this bag fits perfect !                
I'd say that these are absolutely the best soft bags you will find for quickly packing and unpacking drums. The zipper which extends along the handle side makes placing and removing drums a breeze. My Gretsch drums, with large rim mounts, slip in andp out of a them with minimal effort. The bags are substantially built and have a thick fleece lining that does an excellent job protecting the drum. I've purchased a lot of drum bags over the years and these are by far the best that I've found.                
Overall the bags are very durable and very well coushioned, which was a major concern of mine when i was looking for drum bags.The overall quailty is very high. The material is very thick, firm, and very well cushioned, and they do a great job in protecting your investment (your Drums) My recomendation is that you buy these drum bags, you won't regret the purchase.

The shape of the cases is genius                
N/a                
The quality is top notch and seems like it will last a very long time if not abuses                
Its worth every penny                
Haven't had to contact them                
I play a Mapex Saturn series 6 piece and the saturns have unique hardware that requires the cases to be 2 inches oversize. When I bought the kit I assumed that my hard cases would work from my pearl but I was wrong. The ahead armor cases are great. The shape allows for the hardware to fit in the case and not need to be 2 inches oversize. I have played 5 shows so far using the ahead cases and I love them.                 
Been playing and carrying drums around since Moby Dick was a Minnow. I have owned fibre, cordura, beato, skb and the list goes on. AHEAD cases fit well, are very durable and have enough room for rims and other suspension gizmos that stick out from the drums. The zippers are top quality and padding is excellent. Will buy them again for my other sets.

If there was a custom made tom drum bag, the design would not be far from the Ahead Armor bag design.When you place your drum inside the bag, the fit is so perfect, that you feel confident that the drum is safe and protected. There is no swimming around in the bag like some other manufacturers bags. The bag is moderately priced and affordable for the gigging drummer.                
My drums have never sounded better as a result of my frequent use of my drum dial. Although I have a fairly good set of drums (Sonor) the sound of my drums is something I would compare with the best sets on the market.                
My drum dial came with the case and accessories. The high-impact case keeps my drums safe in transfer from place-to-place. It's most useful featuers include ease of operation and consistent tensions. I have a lot of fun "playing with" and experimenting with my drum dial.                
As I indicated above my drums have never sounded better. I have a six-piece set of 9-ply natural maple drums, and the drum dial increases the natural warm sound of my wood drums. Simply put....wow!                
My drum dial appears to be very well constructed. It came without any blemishes and I take excelent good care of my "toys"--especially this toy. I am confident that it will have a long service life as a result of my careful handling of it.                
The drum dial, in my opinion, is worth its weight in gold. As I look back I don't understand why I didn't invest earlier in a drum dial. I am interested in the new digital drum dial but hate to fool around with electronics and batteries. I can just see me at a gig tuning my drums and running short on battery life. Maybe you might think about including extra batteries?                
I ahve had no need of any repairs so it is hard for me to rate this support section.                
Not sure what sex my drum dial is but I think its a guy since it likes to measure stuff. I would like to see drum dials in a rainbow of colors like red, yellow, blue, pink---for the girls.                
In have looked at other products like the Tama drum dial and it looks cheap. So, I intend to stick with what I have because of the obvious quality of the instument.                
I am a professional drummer with over 40 years experience as well as having excellent pitch (I am a singer and guitarist as well).  I thought of myself as having excellent drum tuning skills.  I just borrowed this from a friend and WOW!.  Last week I spent about three hours retuning a used kit that I picked up and it sounded great, but when a friend of mine said you have to try this thing, I thought why not, there are definitely some overtones that I could still use to get rid of.  After about an hour with the Drum Dial, I can say that I never had a kit sound better.  I was actually surprised at how well I did on my own getting the head tensions correct, before using the Drum Dial.  I was never off by more than five pounds and in most cases not more than a few, but even the minor tension adjustments I made with this thing absulutlely rocked my world.  What is more; I can only imagine how much quicker it would have been the first time with the Drum Dial.                  
Comes with info on what tensions to use.                
Very straight forward.                
I am guessing that this is just an adapted lab device.  Very high quality                
The ammount of time saved would make it worth while at twice the price.                
Wouldn't know,  didnt need it and doubt that you ever would                 
I have been looking at this drum dial on and off for the last few years, but always thought that I can do a decent job on my own.  When I tuned up my toms, I couldn't have been more wrong.  My drums sound more alive than they ever had.  This is the best investment you could make for your kit.
I emailed the company to ask about recommended settings for my drums and the president of the company personally emailed me what he recommends.  A week later, he wrote me back for a follow up!                
IM A NEW DRUMMER, AND IVE TRYED ALL THE TUNING TECHNIQUES IT DROVE ME CRAZY, AND IT NEVER SOUNDS RIGHT.  DRUM DIAL DEFINITELY MADE IT EASER. ITS QUICK AND YOU CAN USE THE CHART FOR RETUNING AT DIFFERENT PITCHES UNTILL YOU FIND YOUR SOUND. I WAS VERY SURPRISED IN THE DIFFENENCES.  GREAT FOR NEW DRUMMERS,SAVES TIME AND YOUR PLAYING ON TUNER DRUMS                
Once you open up the drum dial, you recognize the weight of the item and it looks like a good quality device. Once you tune your drum heads to a tight tolerance which focuses on the tension of the head, not the tightness of the lug, you hear a new consistency from your drums. In my case, a birch Tama Silverstar set with stock heads is made much more focused, tight, warm.....it's because the device "hears" your set on a different plane of reference. What sounded pretty good now sounds tremendous. Give it a shot if you are meticulous about tuning.                 
After being on the tech crew of a few thousand shows over the last two decades, it may be difficult to believe, but my hearing is not what it used to be. Drum Dial to the rescue. It makes short work of tuning up my drums. No nasty overtones, just consistent spot on tuning.                
It is something to definitely think about getting if you want to get the optimal sound out of your drums..allows equal tension on all lugs and puts the set in tune and allows the true sound to come out..excellent product!!                
The Drum Dial Precision Tuner is a great tool for taking out the guess work in tuning your drums. I would highly recommend this equipment for all skill levels.                
After using the Drum Dial a few times I went back to tuning my drums the old-fashioned way, and not because I dislike it. It has actually helped me learn to tune better and way faster than I ever could before. I know what my drums should sound like now.                
I am just learning to play, waited 40 yrs to buy a set of drums. Bought a set of drums and did not have a clue where to start on tuning them. The Drum Dial  is great, dont know what i would do without it.                 
Lets face it, tuning a set of drums can be time consuming, especially if you are a perfectionist (like myself). This drum tuner really helps you get the job done quickly, not to mention, its kinda fun.                
Very good tuner for your drum very easy to use nice product                
Great job, fast shipping. Would order from again.                
It's not that the drum dial itself has sound, but it allows me to easily tune my drums so they sound better than they ever did when I was tuning them without the dial.                
The one additional component besides the actual drum dial is a stair-shaped piece of metal -- the edge gauge -- that rests around the center pole of the drum dial and spaces it an ideal distance from the rim. It's a handy measure, but it does not stay well in place and seems more of an afterthought than an actual element of the dial's design.                
The drum dial is very easy to use and helps to take the guesswork out of tuning drums; it really speeds up the process.                
It seems really sturdy. I haven't had any problems with it, aside from the edge gauge which, while useful, could have been better executed. In its current clip-on relationship, it doesn't stay put very well. The needle on my dial doesn't point to zero, but I saw a video online that says it only should point to zero when rested atop a flat piece of solid glass ... and it does. Still, that it's not at zero when at rest does irk me a little, irrational as that may be.                
I don't think the drum dial was a steal, per se, but if it lasts me the rest of my life it will have been worth every penny. As of now, it's quite valuable and a very appreciated invention.                
I'm just putting a 6 because it's a neutral grade; I haven't dealt with their customer service. I did, though, check out their how-to calibration video on YouTube, which was handy.                
This is not a sexy product; it's purely functional but immensely useful.                
I hope to never have to replace it. Time will tell if it's sturdy enough to last, but it certainly seems to be ruggedly constructed. All told, I'm very happy with the product and glad I purchased it.                
Very easy to use, and if you don't like the sound, it is easy to adjust using this tool.                
I love this thing. My Ludwig's never sounded better.                
The best tool to dial in on the true voice of you kit!! Very easy to use! Will let you know if the bearing edges are bad, and/or the hoop is bent or warped. Does take a bit to get dialed in the first time. But once or twice and you will tuning like a pro!!!                
I haven't used them but the interchangeable heads would be very useful                
This is a very high quality stick, with durable covers that can be replaced if they get damaged. I haven't noticed any scratches or dents yet on mine though. The only down point is that the writing wears off, but that's nothing.                
The sticks are expensive compared to other sticks but they're just so much better!                
I haven't had to deal with the company, but the 60 day warranty means they're probably easy ot dael with.                
The black covers with white tips look brilliant, they go great with my black kit.                
I doubt I'll ever go back to using wooden sticks.                
Awesome unique and crisp sounding sticks.                
I love the replaceable tips and sleeves. If they wear out just replace it, simple as that.                
I never really bring extra sticks to practice but the one time i did i actually achieved to break the sticks, thankfully it was at practice but i still trusts these sticks over any other brand.                
These sticks have unique characteristics that just explode into the senses catching and mesmerizing you.                
I expect to be using these sticks for as long as I can keep a beat and thats not going to stop for a while.                
I am 13 years old and I have been playing drums for 7 years now, and I have always been using Vic Firth drumsticks, until my 13th birthday. I got these sticks along with my Gretsch Catalina Birch drum set and I have had the same pair of drum sticks for a year now and they are in perfect condition and they don't have any cracks. These drumsticks are used by many famous bands ( Metallica, Trivium,  Def Leppard, etc.) because they are EXTREMELY reliable and comfortable. I highly recommend these drumsticks. In fact, you need to buy these drumsticks. Since I got these, wooden drumsticks are just not an option for me, they vibrate too much and aren't comfortable. If you are a drummer that wants to save money, save time, and not have to switch drumsticks really fast during a concert if they break, BUY THESE DRUMSTICKS.                
This drumstick sounds a little different than wooden sticks, but i alo think it is harder on cymbals-b/c thier metal-but overall very good drumstick.                
ive had these sticks since spring, and they are just starting to peel the plastic off the stick, i am a very hard drummer though-heavy metal..so i really put them to work when i drum..                
this stick is very playable very different from wood, they bounce alot easier than wood and have a higher pitch when you hit i think..                
very tough drumstick, although mine are starting to peel.. getting ot the metal core now. no bends though.the tips are kinda dumb though you have to super glue them or something..unless you wnat to keep screwing them on all the time..                
very good looking drumstick! they are C-O-C-K-Y chicks dig them- belive me!....                
I just bought these nice Ahead Joey Jordison Sticks and i can only say one thing. They are AMAZING!!! I use a Pearl Export Joey Jordison Signature and they sound great on it!! They are very light weight and easy to use, it's like you cant feel them at all. Some peeople recommend grip tape but I don't really need it. Overall great sticks at a great price. The sound it makes is a nice loud explosive chirp on the snare drum and on the toms....it just makes them sound more alive. Best sticks i have ever used, just it needs a bit more reach. On top of that it lasts quite a long time.                
Its excellent!! It can't be better cept maybe a lil bit more reach, buh other then that it's great. You can change the nylon tips and the shafts no prob and they are cheap too. Like 4 dollars for both shafts and like what 2 dollars for both tips.                 
Well it depends on the drummer. I am kinda an all around drummer though I play alot of metal. You don't even need to worry about the fatigue problem. You can play for weeks on end without tiring your wrists out.                 
It lasts up to like 4-6 months without having to change the shafts or tips. Ahead sticks are made with the nest quality. Every stick is perfect. Just that it might be a pain to change the shafts and tips. You need to use a clamp to twist off the tips then use a blow dryer to soften the plastic so the shaft can slide off. Then put and melt the new shaft on and twist and lock it off with the tip and some super glue. It might seem like a pain but its like changing strings on a floyd rose, a pain but worth doing.                
It is a bit more expensive then other sticks but it's worth it in the long run since most experienced drummers break their sticks like once or twice a week.                 
I actually havent had a problem yet with ahead but if you ever did i don't think they would be that hard to reach. There is also a 60 day warrenty on the sticks.                
It's actually pretty sexy especially is you have a jet black kit like me. The sticks go well with my jordison export or any black coloured kit. Also when you play the white tips gives the stick some extra flare.                
I think i would be using these sticks for a long time. Maybe at least 5 years but then maybe I would like to look for a diffrent sound. If it weren't these sticks then maybe other ahead sticks like the lars sticks or even the Travis Smith ones. Or if i had to pick a whole other brand then maybe vic firth.                
Nope, don't change it: it's light, compact and super cool!                
I'll use this sticks forever and ever!                
I've bought 3-4 pairs and have broken every one of them. Do not buy them thinking they are unbreakable, because they are not! Never get vthe tips to stay on without messy glue.                 
A little more UMPH than most sticks.                
It's a drumstick.  How many features can there be?  However many there are, this stick has them all.                
I think these sticks actually make me play better.                
High quality.  Much much better than plain wooden sticks in my opinion.                
They're a bit expensive, but hey...                
don't know                
Very cool.  Joey Jordison is awesome.                
Awesome sticks.  I don't know if I'd want to buy them again because they're pretty expensive but we'll see how long they last.  I doubt I'll have to replace them anyway.  Then seem that they'll last a long time.                
Awesome last for ever i am a really aggressive drummer and for as long as I've had these i would've broken at least 3 pairs of wooden sticks they are a good investment                
I've found that the AHEAD sticks don't sound quite as crisp as a hard wooden stick, however they still sound great. If the sleeve was engineered a little harder, they would most likely beat the wooden sticks.                
The ability to dismantle every peice of this stick is amazing. Though a dab of superglue on the threads is essential, because I've found that the tip keeps on screwing off.                
A very good stick....extremely dependable. I've had mine for over half a year i think, and there's no sign of any impending failure. These sticks are tough!!                
Compared to how much money worth of wooden sticks you would go through in their lifetime, they're well worth it....probably by 10 times...wouldn't know exactly yet, have only had them for 6 months or so.                
Amazing drumstick overall...unless you're the type of player that either: never breaks sticks, or is dead set on the wooden "stick" sound, I would reccomend them to you.....Just TRY and break these things. It's crazy!                
The sound is super cool it is by far the best iv ever used........                
the only thing i dont like about them is when my hands get sweaty they get a bit slippery....but that can be fixed i guess.....                
The Quality beats anything else..........just try and break these by playin' they are simply awesome                 
They are very cheap for the value......buy these instead of buyin' a new pair every month                 
Overall these are a beautiful stick they are consistent they are easy on the hands, durable, virtually unbreakable, really, what is not to like.....                
I recently purchased this throne as an upgrade over a Roc N Soc throne with a back rest. I found that I wasn't using the back rest and I was having lower back issues. I decided after seeing a Hobson bike seat similar to this throne (split for pelvis independence) at my chiropractor's office that I would give this a shot. My chiropractor also happens to be a drummer and he thought this could be a good thing too. After about a month into using the throne, I really like it a lot. The lower back/hip/sacroiliac issues are gone while I play and do not bother me after playing either. I would recommend this product to other drummers who have lower back issues. I do a lot of separate and independent work between feet - I have a very active hi hat foot and a lot of action in the bass drum foot too. I do feel a difference when playing on this throne compared to my Roc N Soc. I had a Gibraltar throne before that that I liked as well but this Ahead Spinal G throne is the best I've used. Also - do not buy just the seat top without the base. All of the mounting hardware is a different size (as other reviewers pointed out). Buy the whole throne if you decide to buy it.                
I recently purchased the AHEAD Spinal G throne. I gig often with a Corporate band and my posture is not good. So far, this throne has made me want to straighten out my spine, and sit "tall." It may sound silly, but any professional or middle school band director will tell you that good posture promotes great playing and endurance.When you are drumming for an hour straight, good posture is very important. So far, the throne has given me support that I have been missing, and the four-legged foundation REALLY gives you solid footing behind your kit!It needs a back rest! For $200 it should have one. I'm not a big fan of the stitching on the bicycle seat. The black sparkle sides match my kit which is nice, but I am concerned that over time, it will tear easily. It is $60 more (on average) than most professional grade thrones. I spent the extra $60 because if this throne allows my spine not to compress while I am performing, I believe that my endurance will improve, and I will not be sore after a gig. Though it is more expensive than most thrones, can you honestly put a price on ling term comfort and endurance? No...Save the extra $60 and INVEST in you equipment. If you buy a $50 throne, you will end up buying more than one over time. One negative, is that the wing nut that sets the four legs gets in the way when you break the legs down. It is a struggle to tighten the wing nut to keep the legs from opening. Someone made a design error. :-)Haven't a need for Manufacturer support. zZounds has made it more convenient for me to buy gear and pay in installments! THAT is the best deal in town for sure!THANK YOU zZounds!
Lastly, I used the "sound" rating for "comfort."  I gave it a 4 because it needs a back rest.. Manfacturer support received a 5 because I do not need support.  The product is sturdy, and can't imagine it breaking (Seating material aside)                
I bought this sight unseen on recommendation of a friend and I was not disappointed. At 6'3' and 300* lbs I needed a extremely sturdy throne that would be comfortable as well. I can play for hours at a time with no problems and no pain. I highly recommend it.                
The Advance 61 is high-quality product which comes with lots of very good free software (downloadable), but suffers somewhat through lack of full support for the complete integration of the VIP VST Host software.
The keyboard itself is very well built. I find myself wishing this keyboard was on all of my other synths and workstations ... it's that good. The pitch wheel has an oddly slow return-to-center. This will bug some players, but I find it works just fine. I should note that there is something comforting and inviting about the construction of the wheels themselves. The buttons, knobs and pads are first-quality and reassuring "pro" feeling.
The VIP VST host concept is incredible, when it works right, which it does with most VSTs. It's very possible to scarcely look at your computer screen at all ... the workflow is that well thought out and intuitive. You'll need to need the manual and scratch your head about a few things, but it becomes obvious very quickly.What's bad (and the reason for the 3 start overall score) is that VIP isn't very well supported by Akai, in the sense of maintaining patch maps and compatibility. There are significant problems/bugs with some populatr VSTs (in my case Arturia MiniV and Prophet V) which make these VSTs unusable within VIP. These have been known for months with little support from Akai besides "trying reinstalling".
Despite the fact that this is a MIDI controller, I rated sound 5-stars owing to the excellent compliment of VSTs which are included. Its' not an exaggeration to say you'd have a complete sound-set with just what is included. These are not stripped down versions, but the "real thing" from Air Music Technologies. The inclusion of a DAW program - like  Abelton light - would have made this a "system in a box", but now I am quibbling.                
Ordered this beauty last week, this being my first controller I do not have any experience to compare it to another controller. I will say that it is a extremely professional looking and feeling instrument, everything responds perfectly; I have never used a keyboard before so getting used to how the keys react was different since they are pressure sensitive. VIP software works great, I can find useful sounds a lot quicker then before when I was just using my DAW to browse the sounds. Definitely recommend you pick one up, has all of the features you could want, and that screen on the keyboard is extremely useful. The included Plug-ins sound amazing as well! Hybrid and VacuumPro have allot of great sounds, Hybrid has an infinite amount of trance based sounds. Excited to dive into it more and more each day, is a very inspiring instrument.                 
I read many reviews before purchasing this Controller. The keybed is on par with my Synthesizer collection. The rotary encoders have a nice solid feel and no stepping that I have encountered yet.
I purchased a separate power supply due to the fact that I run multiple instruments off of the Daw PC bus 10 USB ports all full. Some provide power some, just data. Either way, a USB Bus on a MoBo can only provide so much current.
Integration with Cubase and Sequel was a breeze. I did not need an I-Lok Account for the included software.Integration with Ableton was just as simple.
Expression and Sustain jacks both work as intended.
MIDI in and Out is easily configured. This controller was a wise investment and has already paid for itself. I would recommend this controller to anyone who needs quick access to multiple VST's and hardware at the same time.
well worth the value. The three stars are for Akai's archaic web support system. It works but it needs more plain directions and an easier to follow format.
Shipping from zZounds was fast and the package arrived in good condition with no signs of damage.10/10 would purchase again                
Keybed is heavier than my Yamaha Motif action but lighter than my Moog Sub Phatty. Keys are very responsive will get better as I use it more. Software was not too difficult to install and iLOK is not a requirement. Pads feel ok. Knobs are awesome. Documentation on Hardware Midi use is very sparse Akai should look into revising the manual. Packaging was adequate and it arrived safely.
The VIP software picked up my most important VST's that I use for my works.USB driver installation was straightforward.                
I am loving this keyboard!! Just the look of it inspires me. I love being able to control my instruments and effects with VIP software. It feels like more than a midi controller, solid and sturdy, just like my old Roland and Korg boards. My workflow has definitely sped up. Keys are a little stiff, compared to the NI Kontrol Series., but playable.                
Standalone using VIP is simply amazing. Don't even need your computer Screen on. Sounds great like concert class. Mine won't work with Reaper, I've looked at videos and tried reinstalling the DAW program and no go. Ableton works good with it except for the fact it won't let me Import plugins from VIP, shows my folder empty but all the plugins are in VIP. Customer support isnt very great. Haven't heard back about issue. The VIP software is a little buggy sometimes starting. Have to close and restart. The key board functions, features and build quality are very good. Doesn't feel like a cheap plastic. There are better products out there but for the quality and amount of plugins VIP gives you. It's not a bad deal, you can always add equipment however you choose your setup to be. BTW the grand piano sounds amazing. Sadly sounds better then some videos of regular Yamaha keyboards. If I were to purchase a different keyboard it would be the Native Komplete Kontrol downside is your stuck using their stuff only and you have to buy the program not to mention that will run you 1200k. It's worth it if your positive that's all you want to use but why be limited.                
Essential tool for any serato user. If you've been using serato for awhile you understand the value of a full DVS system you can fit in your laptop case for under $400. This is not only a great option for gigging but it also unlocks the full version of serato for setting up and rough drafting routines anywhere on the fly.                 
This controller is an awesome, cheaper alternative to a serato mixer. perfect for traveling or for a little at home studio. The included innofader is worth it alone. Cant wait to order the AFX                
This is not something I would take to serious gigs but it's a legit backup with some unique features. Great for someone on a budget.                
An amazing product! Will be super dope in the future if Akai Releases an upgraded model with a screen similar to the Push 2, that being said I chose this APC40 over Push 2 because the APC is rooted to me towards making mixes and controlling the DAW, where the Push is more meant for writing and controlling. I make Progressive Trance similar to Anjunabeats and Elliptical Sun Artists, and I do not necessarily need a beat maker like the Push 2. 
The APC40 really feels like you are inside of Ableton, the 1:1 ratio between the mixer in the DAW and the controller is amazing, it feels like you have Abletons mixer in your hands. The knobs are all really amazing for controlling Ableton Macros, and controlling VSTs is very intuitive and third-party plug-ins as well. The A/B Crossfader is also a really creative feature to test your tracks into lil mixes. Highly recommend this product, it makes me enjoy Ableton 10x more.                 
An amazing controller that allows you to take your tracks into the realm of performance and past simple playback. The layout is intuitive and easy to maneuver. Its highly portable and the build quality seems pretty good, not amazing but solid. Sliders and knobs all have a nice smooth feel to them and the mapping capabilities make it supremely flexible. So far I would highly recommend it.                 
It Sounds like 90% of sounds you hear in movies and tv.                
Complete, even batteries.                
At first its like any other wind instrument...not as easy as it seems but if you have any experience learning any musical instrument you will soon realize that its perfectly fine to do some research and spend a few weeks working on it before you take it out to your next gig. (It does help improve posture and dexterity on other woodwinds instruments. That's a plus)                
Its solid, no worries, you are not going to break any keys.
It looks good, civilians love it as well as musicians.                
Definitely. Its a valuable tool for the price. Given the importance and demand of the business today. EWI players are capable of doing what no other midi instrument can. Price is right.                
Have not used yet.                
A nice addition to my setup. A plus in every way.                
Very satisfied. Unique, the best on the market, I will cote Michael Brecker "Thanks Akai"                
After taking the time to read the instructions and following some YouTube tutorials, I was up and playing what I hear in my mind. This thing is very expressive. ZZounds gave me an awesome price! Thank you so much.                 
After owning the Akai EWIUSB for over a year I decided to buy the 4000s model. I am very happy with it...especially with the great price I got from Zzounds! Thanks!
Also the customer service is fantastic!
I used to only shop with American Musical Supply; however, almost every item I received had to go back because it was missing parts or just did not work! I believe they are selling second items!
NOT TRUE WITH ZZOUNDS!
I will be making another purchase in the near future!                
Love the woodwind voices the best. Cool instrument. Takes some time to get used to. Neat tutorials by people in England on youtube. I found them helpful.                
I have not used the instrument long enough to know how well it sound compared to other natural instruments. However, I have heard others play the EWI in bands and for personal use and they sounded great. I bought mine to learn  how to play a wind instrument, at 67 I couldn't blow a natural instrument if I was the wind. The EWI is so easy to blow into and make a sound. Now all I need is to disipline my self to learn the mechanics of a note, which may be harder than blowing. It is a great instrument and I am proud to have it!!!!                
The USB feature which allows me to use the instrument any where I go.                
see above comment                
Akai  has the best in sound equipment. I have used this brand for years and I am well satisfied with their products.                
Zzounds has supplied mw with great quality products at the most reasonable pricing. Add in the 4 pay and it is a win win situation for the customer. I can't se me using any other music store to purchase high end equipment or standard musical instrumentation.                
Zzounds is always excellant with the support they give their customers!!!!!                
I have wanted an EWI since they first came on the market. When they came out with the less expensive USB models I was ready to buy. Before the USB version they were way out of my price range at $600.00 and up, where the USB version is just over $250.00.                
I want to learn to play the EWI, so I wont be satisfied until I do!!!!! It will never be lost, but if stolen I would probably buy another or start playing the harmonica!!!!                
Akai Ewi Usb is a great beginning Instrument for people who is looking for something new. I would advice you to get the warranty because it is showing me signs that I should have got one.                
Worked for about 15 minutes, then stopped working. ZERO support from Akai, never answered emails, so no help there. Bought another one, because they were cheap, and it didn't work at all--tried on all four computers I have, and never got a chance to use it. Total waste of money. When it did work for a few minutes, it sounded like a kazoo or toy instrument. Not a quality instrument. Akai needs a real customer service department that answers customer questions and problems. Without it, their stuff is worthless. Too bad.                
Excellent little travel pad controller.  Can handle most any beat you throw at it.                
For this one I have to give it a 9.  The only reason I am giving it a 9 is the included software is confusing and Akai does not have any presets for popular software included or on their site.                
Again, a 9 because of the trouble programing it.  The device itself is fairly easy to use, but the software needs revamped.                
Sturdy, and solid pads with quality knobs.  You can't go wrong with this mini-Controller.                
Inexpensive and well built.  The only way you can go wrong is if you need more controls.                
I assume it will be excellent, but I don't know yet.                
Nice look, easy to use, and travels well.  Need I say more.                
With few exceptions, not related to the device itself but the editing software, this is the perfect pad controller for the mobile laptop studio.                
you use it to control sounds.                
the 8 pads are lovely. the 8 knobs are lovely. they also feel goods.                
just plug that little sucker in and your good to go. wait I lie, I had to do some editing on the Akai Editor but it was no hassle at all.
I use it with Ableton Live and they work together as a great tag team.
I dont slam my equipment on the wall so I cant say much on what exactly the LPD8 can and cant survive
But I love the feel of the pads, I love the orange LED that it makes when you hit the pads. The knobs are nice and fat.
This product has waaaaaaaaaaay better quality build than the NanoPad (I owned it, pads went out on me)                
there is no better drum controller for this price better than this. IT IS BETTER than the NanoPad.
I havent contacted Akai yet. no need.                
the black pads, the LED, its rectangular size. It can travel safely anywhere with ya.  It makes me feel good, inside.
I love that I can now program my drums hitting the pads, instead of keys. But you can groove anyway you want people.                  
I will only replace this if I ever have the courage to buy me an electric drumset.  
As ive said before, it is soooo much better than the NanoPad.                 
the thing was amazing when i took it out of the package... but only a few days later the usb plug for the pads broke! the thing cost me about $100(including the warranty) and i was pissed. the thing its self was great, the pads a little less sensitive then what i wanted but thats alright.                 
Received the Akai LPK 25 on February 16, 2011. Not a novice to music and music performance but I had never really got into midi controllers and using DAW software. So this is my first experiment into the world of midi.
For the price of this midi controller I am extremely amazed! This little controller is solid, and the velocity sensitive keys are wonderful and helps create that more "human sound" when playing.
I have been using it with Ableton Live and it's really a lot of fun how simple but great this product sounds.                
The Akai LPK 25 was a snap to install! Actually there is really nothing to it, just plug it into a usb port and you are done! Just that simple.
It did come with little piece of software for setting up the arpegiattor which can be set to external control so it can sync with your DAW's timing or you can set it independently.
There was no fuss setting it up in Ableton, in fact there was nothing to setup. I just plug in the LPK 25, startup Ableton and it automatically just works.                
Very easy to use, small and portable. Great as an added piece to your 'mini studio' setup, or for taking on the road so you have an easy device to record ideas anytime/anywhere inspiration may hit.                
Great quality, the keys feel great, it definitely doesn't feel cheap when you play which surprised me to be honest.                 
The price is what blew me away. As a person that wanted to get into midi for the first time I was always a bit put off by the higher priced controllers and was specifically looking for something that not only offered what some of the higher priced controllers did but for a nice low price.
If and when I do upgrade to a more elaborate setup, this LPK 25 will still definitely be used as a wonderful tool that is portable, and great for testing out musical ideas on the go.                
Not applicable...
not had to contact support for anything yet "knock on wood" it's worked 100% since I've had it and just been a lot of fun.                
Small, portable, yet the feel is very professional, the velocity sensitive keys and the feel of the keys is done very well, which shocked me that the price wasn't much higher.                
I really like this keyboard - small light and compact, easily fits in a bag for the road warrior musical producer.     The keys are nice, and i like the easy transpose feature, which slides up the scale an octave in either direction.   The biggest complaint I have however, is that the usb input, is a bit flimsy.    I unplugged my usb cable and it seemed to shift and maybe dislodge the wiring.   Now it registers as connected only half of the time, even though it is plugged in always.    This could be a great tool, but it needs SERIOUS revisions.                
Has with most Akai products the sound quality is exceptionally and is compatible with most software.                
It has 25 keys and is portable, most software are compatible with this keyboard.  But you may have to fine tune the software.                  
The keyboard is made well responds to touch pretty accurately.  No sticking of the keys and no need to hit extremely hard. It is also lite weight and fits in most laptop bags easily                
I have not dealt with the company personally.                   
I purchased this product for portability and I am pleased.  Don't forsee any future problems.  I would recommend it for that feature alone. This company also make larger keyboards which are able to take advantage of the every expanding softwares that are available.                 
This Keyboard Controller is a really good product. I was looking for a controller that was small and compact so that I could easily carry it around with my laptop. I went with the smaller more compact Korg Nano keyboard controller at first. I was not satisfied with that product because it was just too flimsy and it didn't have a real keyboard feel to it. I then purchase the Akai LPK25 and realized it should have been my first choice. Even thought it was a little larger and bulkier then the korg, it was still very portable and had a much better feel to it. It's still a very basic controller, but it dose that job very well at a price that I can appreciate. The only negative experience I had with it was that the keys are small and the pressure sensitivity of the keys are sometime non responsive.                 
Well Built                
This little keyboard is so amazing, I got it to use with Reason (and a few other DAW's), and it really has mind-blowing responsiveness to the nuances of how hard you play. If you've got a pretty decent computer, and are using something like Reason, you can adjust the latency etc. to play what you play almost immediately without delay. The only downside is that the keys are pretty small(but that's so you can take it anywhere and use it)...But trust me, you'll quickly get used to the small keys. One other thing: Be very careful about plugging it in. If it's not fitting, don't push very hard, because you can push the inside of the plug down inside the piano. Other than that, this thing is pure gold.                 
I've been using my Midimix on the go for the past year or so And I didn't really have time to review but It's durable and reliable. It's small and affordable. Very nice button and knob display. Try it yourself. The only pitfall is, the lights will only work in ableton live. However, that doesn't compromise the MidiMix's performance. And yes, it does work with any daw.                
As a gear head- I've had many samplers including the MPC2000XL which I regretfully sold a very long time ago- the concept of having the MPC standalone again is amazing!! Especially  in a time where I really wanted to get away from being tethered to a laptop or computer which has been the trend in the industry lately that I'm glad AKAI decided to step back from after the Touch and MPC Renaissance. 
The MPC is reborn-- the LIVE feels great!! Lightyears ahead of it's ancestors before it and IMO- even it's computer tethered counterparts today like maschine and push. Everything from the RGB pads to the super responsive touch screen/ with a ton of features literally at your fingertips just makes you want to play with it NONSTOP. Features like Pad Perform gets you making melodies right away without even having to plug in a Midi controller- definitely making it easy for you to get started on a song in no time.
 I've already sampled some my favorite drums machines and synths in my collection right to the unit- sounds fantastic!! 
It's been so refreshing to go standalone-  I use it as my main sequencer to control my hardware synths. I couldn't be happier without the laptop. 
I'd also like to thank zZounds for helping finally get one- My customer service agent Fransico did an awesome job- thank you for all your help you are awesome!  
Raw sounds tend to clip, so adding compression on every track and the master is a must in standalone mode. When working in controller mode, it is best to have some decent channel strip plugins or a solid preset of stock devices in your DAW of choice. When exporting songs in standalone mode at 320 kpbs, I have found the sound quality to be comparable to Ableton Live and FL Studio.                
Best features of the MPC Live are definitely the External Drive bay for expandability, the natural feel and color organization of the Pads, the amount of I/O on the Rear Panel, and of course, Q-Links.                 
As others have stated, there is definitely a steep learning curve with this product. I highly recommend a thorough manual read, in addition to watching as many videos about the MPC Live as possible. Once the initial concepts of Tracks, Keygroup Programs, and Sequences are learned, the songwriting process becomes easier.                 
Extremely high build quality, solid as a rock. All metal chassis means this thing can take a beating, but obviously don't try to give it one. I have flown with mine, and after 2 months, the only real sign of wear is the matte finish rubbing off the corners from me not keeping it in a case.                 
Definitely worth the money, and to me the price tag was perfect. The Roland Fantom X6 that I mentioned as being the best music making tool I ever purchased was the exact same price at the time I purchased it, and I feel so much more confident about my investment this time around. Yes, it is a valuable product worth every penny you pay for it..                 
Haven't had to go to Akai for anything yet except initial download software and hopefully it stays that way.                
Every person I have shown it to is amazed by the portability, size, and form factor, in addition to how much it can do. I definitely feel awesome knowing that very few people chose the MPC Live when there are so many other similar products out there. I think the real WOW factor is the Lithium-Ion Battery, which is why I left that out of my best features. The 5-6 hour battery life is what sets the MPC Live apart from the Toraiz SP-16, the Octatrak, the Maschine, Novation Circuit and every other Drum Machine. The true standalone power of a 7 inch screen for midi sequencing, audio editing, and mixing makes the MPC Live the best and only choice for any Hip Hop, R&B, and Dance producers, beat makers, or any sort of live electronic musician looking for a product to integrate to a non-computer based, standalone hardware setup.                
Overall, the MPC Live is the best music making product I have purchased since my Roland Fantom X6 in 2001. As a Music Producer, it is important to have an easy way to create, organize and manipulate sounds in a mobile format. The MPC Live is the solution to the most common computer-based producer problems because of its flexibility. The MPC Live can adapt to virtually any style or genre, and there are many ways to enhance your music making experience.                
I got this unit in July and still learning how to use it. I have never used an MPC before. The mac pro video series has a tutorial that skims the basics, after watching that I started messing around with it. The MPC forums have a lot of valuable information to help you get started. If you buy this unit the only thing you MUST also buy is the MPC bible from the MPC forums. It dives in depth and will turn you into a master. 
 Now to review this unit let me begin by putting out the most important gripe by many others, The software is still in Beta mode and some features are not yet available. Trust me the features in which are available will keep you busy for the next year at least.
 The Live has a battery and you can use it anywhere. The build quality reminds me of the Ableton Push very solid! It comes with a lot of sounds but you must remember that this is a sampler so the sounds are unlimited. The inputs on the back are 1/4 inch dual phono jacks unless you have a turntable and ONLY then can you use the RCA's via phono preamps. You will need a mic preamp if you want to use a mic. May I suggest buying a Tascam DR-40 or other mini recorder with a 1/8" stereo jack to dual 1/4 inch phono jacks to make a portable rig to get your mic sounds into the Live. without needing power. The wifi and blue tooth are not active yet but will be soon. 
 The Live works very well and if you never have used MPC like me, you will be able to have a lot of fun learning it as you make music with it. This unit is deeper than you could imagine with all the onboard Fx and instruments. If you are reading this you should buy one for yourself only if you want a portable studio that rocks and you are willing to learn to use the Live.                
This product is everything and some .. I'm loving it.... and I love zZounds so much for letting me upgrade my setup without all the money up front ... sampling is a breeze for me know ... before I was sampling through a program then dragging it over to Mpc software.. dnt have to do that anymore ..                 
The mpc live is so good its one of the best mpc made i have been using the mpc since the 3000 this is a major improvement in workflow and the sound content is off the chain you will be able to make great music with just the sound and software that came with the mpc it has all the plugins you need to finish your song i recommend this if you want a standalone situation but if not needed you can get the mpc touch and be fine or if you don't need a touch screen the mpc studio will do the same thing as the other mpc akai products are great!!!!                
I had the mpc 500 and the 1000 and moving to this was fairly ez. I'd say the touch screen is better than the lcd line display I'm used to and the  workflow is nice. Only things I'm not crazy about is it's a freaking dust magnet with it's rubber feel coating. Also when plugged in I get a noise so I have to unplug and go to battery to be able to work on it, not sure if there is something on my end to fix that but I'll be looking into it. Otherwise a very capable piece of gear.                 
Friend of mine was in a terrible accident while he was healing in the hospital his MPC LIve shipped.We had a fantastic experience learning this amazing piece of equipment together and it really allowed my buddy to take his mind off his pain. One day later after jamming out in the burn unit my homie was able to go home and enjoy his new MPC Live;special powers this thing possesses                 
Man oh man i tell ya this thing here i cant explain but the stuff this thing is capable of the videos on youtube dont even show the true power of the mpc live only thing im pretty mad about is i cant run vst instruments on standalone but i can live without it and use my vsts on the 2.0 software for now hopefully akai can put that into a future update but for now im fully satisfied with it this is way better then the mk3 maschine but dont get me wrong i tryed the mk3 its pretty dope too but mpc live is the champ for now

Crash crash crash not able to save not useful at this piont untill akai fix all the bugs this thing is useless my bke beat thang works better then this and trust me the beat thang crashes alot too                
I was skeptical at first about purchasing this unit but it actually has more bang for the buck than expected. I am a fan of akai owning the mpc 2000xl. It is still a solid unit to this day. I bought it back in 2001. With the evolving methods of production these days, you can produce good material right from your pc with midi controller equipment. The Akai MPC studio black is a great answer to this call. Compared to the stand alongs, This unit surprisingly duplicates that essence of what the MPC line is all about. The sequencer in any unit is very important. The timing clock built on this unit cause your pc to give very tight timing. That plus the tweaked sound library that comes with it makes you appreciate the tradition of Akai Drum pad unit line as usual.
Back in about 2007 I had an MPC1000, I had no clue about FL Studio until a year later and so without knowing how to transfer my music from the MPC to CPU or use a Keyboard. I switched to FL Studio. I always wanted the Ren but of course cost was an issue. Once I found the MPC Studio I was in heaven. Now depending on the type of beat. I will work in MPC Daw or Fl Studio Daw. I love the Converters that Akai uses and I love the workflow. The pads feel great! Very durable and I can now use VSTs and Keyboard controllers!!! Best think ever! Follow me on Instagram to see how I use both the MPC and FL Studio to create great compositions! @JetMuzikBeats                
I feel the mpc software is only good for sample based production beat making. Haven't tried Native Instruments yet but think it's looks nicer graphic and workflow wise. But since more it's geared more towards trap beats, red flag. And let's not sleep on fl studio slicex either. But as for the mpc studio. I came to conclusion that the mpc touch is a better choice(in-spite not being a standalone either) if you decide to get one. The studio takes to up too desk/table space and has no inputs etc. which is wack. The Mpc touch is sleeker, doesn't look ancient, and has a touchscreen that resembles the featured software etc. Need I mention more?                
I have been so productive since I got the touch. The software is easy to learn, the pads feel good, and the touch screen is a nice touch. I wish I could record midi straight into to logic but hey nothing is perfect. I would definitely recommend this product. Big thanks to zZounds for letting me pay over time.                
I own the MPC LIVE and have owned the MPC 500 and 1000 in the past and purchased the MPC Touch just recently and can tell you it holds up to the best of the rest. Honestly I use my Live in controller mode more than standalone so the touch would have been sufficient for me to begin with but I didn't realize that until I got the touch of course. Akai is my happy place so I can't say enough good about any of my gear from them. Oh and I left a review on the Live and mentioned a noise problem, just to update it wasn't the unit at all, I was getting noise from a powerstrip, changed it up problem solved. I'd update my review there but don't see the option.                
This is the best piece of production hardware ive ever owned. A great deal of how much you will get out of it depends on how much time you spend learning the Touch and its software, MPC 2.0. If you put the time in like I did watching tutorials and practicing how to make music with it, it pays off ten fold and is a lot of fun to use along the way.                 
The Touch is not the Renaissance but if you already have a phono preamp and dont need extra midi I/O or USB inputs get the Touch if you want a Touch screen. It's cool using the Touch screen but if you like the classic MPC workflow/feel... The Renaissance is the closest midi controller to that feel. I sold my Renaissance and got the Touch and don't regret it but, I may get another Renaissance in the  future after the next flagship MPC is released and prices drop. The Touch is nice great for traveling and can be a center piece in your studio. The workflow takes sometime to get use too. There are some functions on the Touch that have no been implemented yet. The new 2.0 MPC software update will take it to DAW status so maybe the touch screen will really have deeper integration. I've had the Maschine studio and Push 2 and although I really like komplete 10 and Ableton Live I found the MPC workflow better for me but, both of them are good options but the MPC software is very easy to get around and there are plenty of free online tutorial vids. 
If you're just starting out and only have a computer no audio interface the MPC Renaissance  is the best value followed by the Touch IMO. My 3rd choice would be Push 2 "because Live is awesome but a learning curve for me" next MPC Studio and Maschine last.... But in the end they all do the same thing but workflow and ease of use and quickly being able to quickly put down an idea and later building it up the MPC software Madrid EZ                
I used samplers for years and all different types to include the MPC Renaissance which was my first Akai and even though both the Touch and Renaissance use the exact same hardware the MPC Touch is so intuitive. I love creating with this gear!                
i sold my MPC ren to buy the Touch and i later regretted. To me the touch screen is a gimmick. I sold it and I now use the Ableton Push 2 and I'm very satisfied but i will keep an eye out for a cheap MPC REN or maybe a studio to have because i do like the MPC software                 
I must I have no idea of what I am doing struggling and struggling with drivers, software and verification for hours, horrible horrible was to start out. Called tech support they emailed me a one sheet that did nothing except make me spend another 3 hours messing with it.                
Finally, Akai has come to their senses to make a standalone/hybrid Mpc. I have owne the mpc 2500 limited edition the renaissance, and still own the touch, and this unit by far is the best of the best. It has a very fast learning curve, the pads feel great and nice response. I have only had it a few days but I have not had any issues. Back lit labels make it east]y to get around fast, just buy it you won’t regret it.                
I have the pleasure of owning the MPC Live. It is a BEAST! My overall project results have gone up by 50% because of it's sequencing and crispness in sound.
I just love it. The workflow is better. You can get ideas down in a flash. You can add an internal sata drive for more storage and navigation is a breeze. I'm going to get the big brother to my live next because I like they way the pads sit directly under the screen where I can peak up at the screen while tracking. It'll be around a long time. It is the new classic to it's already long line of products. Thanks AKAI for finally releasing these killer units. It was and is worth the wait.                
This came with 2 FREE VST programs that are great!! 
The function and quality is nice, the pads react smoothly....I don't know why you would want to buy a midipad for any other price when this entry level priced pad does the job so well!                
I love feel of it. It took me some time to get used to it but being a studio one user it intergrated immediately even without having to download the software for it. Thinking about getting the mpd226.                
I love this little thing it's perfect and does what it say. But my only gripe is it's so light and I wish it came with a stand to make it sit up higher.                
Seems to respond very well. No issues as of yet. Shame the instructions are terrible though. Definite learning curve, but well worth the price. Youtube is going to be your best friend...                
A Classic reborn !!!! cant wait to try the 232 model                
 it's a controller so there is no sound.                
I haven't used manufacturer support.                
I love it. The pads are super sensitive. I love the addition of the pitch & mod wheels, and the keys feel great.                
This controller is amazing. Plug it in, Turn knob to your favorite DAW and you're on your way!
Having owned a original MPK49, the upgrades they have installed are excellent.
The DAW Control button let's me click through pre-set's with out having to touch my mouse or even look at my computer screen. This is all out of box mapping on a wide range of popular VSTi's. 
My only suggestion to new buyer's is pay the $20 for the A/C Adapter.
MPK's can only receive midi information if the A/C Adapter is plugged in. This will allow you to use the Arp and Note Repeat on External Midi clock's.                
Been using this for 3 years now, solid as a rock. I control multiple daws and softsynths as well as multiple hardware units. Built like a talk, beautiful looking, easy to program. Keys feel GREAT, and the pads are, well, Akai pads, the best there is.                 
I was looking for a more 'control from the Midi-Controller' set up than my old Alesis Q61. I wanted to be able to have sliders for the mixer, transport to interface with my DAW and and other programs. This seemed to promise that it worked with all software DAW's.  Turned out that it was not set up to work with DP8. There was no preset for DP8, or Notion 5. In short, there were presets for most other pro Software based Daw's EXCEPT for DP8 and Notion 5. The Quickstart guide was so curt and uninformative, I couldn't find a detailed set up to try to set up MPK261. I contacted Akai and they said there was no detailed way to do this and try to contact MOTU. I contacted MOTU and Notion. End result: Nothing works as promised  for my DAW's. I have basically the same functions as my $150 Q61, but for $499. Transport does not interface. Pads are not needed. Sliders do little that I need. Tap tempo is not how I work, arrpeggiator is fun but not needed.For my needs I give this  few stars. For those that work in the way this controller is set up, probably fantastic controller.                 
The description of product is misleading .using a plugin every time use it.time comsuming.concerning workflow.mpc essentials is great easy tool. Live lite doesn't have full control capabilities. Can't download 88 Keys. The product specs are great.It looks good.I can achive more out my old keyboard, without connecting plugins and other power supplies that this thing needs.pads are great avelibilty on keyboard,that's all. This keyboard is not worth the price. The most disappointing thing is: thare are no demos that are helpfull. You got go to YouTube to figure how to conect (for full control) of knobs.through other consumers
I did a lot of comparison shopping for 25 key controllers, even after getting this one and using it for a few days. I originally wasn't very happy with it. I considered sending it back and getting something else instead. My perception was that the keys were not responsive. It turns out that it was just my laptop's audio driver latency which was bad. When playing the soft synths in Reason, the latency gave a perceptible lag, which you may not realize is latency at first but something just feels off. I mistakenly blamed the keyboard at first, until I plugged in an external USB audio device with ASIO drivers and played through that. The latency was gone and the keyboard seemed much more responsive. The second thing I didn't really care for was the mini keys. I didn't realize the keys were so small before I purchased it. There are a few other 25 key controllers with full size keys, and I thought about replacing it with one. 
In the end, I decided to keep it because I already have a nice big 61 key controller in my studio. I bought the Akai as something to use with the laptop and maybe take along on vacation. And for that purpose, it is perfect. It really is very small and light. It fits in a laptop bag. I can live with the tiny keys since I'm no piano player anyway, and it fits directly in front of the laptop nicely. 
The pitch/mod joystick is a pretty nifty feature. Be aware though that it always snaps back to the middle. Mod wheels usually stay put. Plus the zero joystick position sends 50% on the modulation instead of 0. To get to 0 you have to pull the joystick down. I think this is editable in the software though. In the alternate case pulling down on the joystick will send the same data as pushing up. I always like the Roland joysticks that combined pitch and mod that only pushed up and not down. At any rate, the Akai joystick is a fun controller that doesn't take up hardly any space and can be used in lots of creative ways. Plus I think you can map it to different controller numbers.
The eight pads take up a lot of space. I won't comment about the pad responsiveness compared to whatever, since I'm not a big pad user. Obviously all the controllers are moving toward more and more pads, I assume because of Ableton. I don't mind a few pads, but keys work just as well for programming drums. I'd rather have more knobs, myself. The knobs on the Akai work just fine.
The arpeggiator is a nice bonus feature that I haven't seen on any other mini controller. It's a very simple one, but it's really easy to switch it on when you want a quick preview of how a patch would sound arpeggiated. Plus you can latch it.
The knobs and pads have 4 different programs you can switch between. You have to use the editor software to configure it. You can set which note the pads send and which CC number the knobs send. I set program 1 on mine to map to the first 8 pads in the Reason Kong device, and the knobs to map to filter 1 and 2 cutoff and resonance, plus a/d/s/r envelope on most Reason synths. And program 2 pads to the second 8 Kong pads, and the knobs to the combinator knobs.
A note on the editor software. It's got some bugs that you have to be aware of to get it to work properly. When you first try to send or receive data from the Akai, it will pop up a box asking you to select the input and output device. The trick is to ONLY select the output, else it will crash the program. It took some digging to find this on the Akai website. I did put in a trouble ticket at first but NEVER GOT A REPLY! I almost sent it back over the crappy editor software and lack of support as well. But I got it to work eventually.
Overall, I would prefer normal size keys. But I like how small and light this is, while still having a joystick, 8 pads, 8 knobs, and an arpeggiator, plus 4 banks on the controllers. The only extra I wish it had is some transport buttons.                 
I travel a lot. I make a lot of music on the go. I use this board with Logic Pro X. Works great for me. I took a while for me to get it configured but after doing so, I'm impressed with it. Very simple and easy to use. Very small but powerful. Allows me to work on music at the office or in my bedroom, or just any place where I couldn't take a full size keyboard or controller.                 
Just received this little guy and i love it! using it for synths solos, organs and plan to use the pads for launching tracks.
I love the 2 free day shipping thanks zZounds!!! will continue to purchase equipment here!                
This thing is fantastic.
The only con is the manual says to use TRS cables to record audio in and disable the mic. That's not true! It actually requires TS cables! TRS cables won't turn off the internal mic and will not record clear audio or mono with this device. However, TS cables work great and the device responds to those immediately.
Besides that, it's a great multipurpose sampler and is easy to use. You can record any mono or stereo audio via line in and editing is straight forward. You can also drag and drop Wav. files onto the device via usb.
After sampling, just drag and drop the Wav file into your DAW or record line in via the MXP16 line outs.
It's as easy as that.
We use this thing as a sample trigger for various sweeps and movie samples during our live shows. The loop functionality and ability to change velocity, pitch, and volume on the fly is extremely useful. Samples can be loaded directly from PC to SD card and kits can be created and saved to the card.Only con is long samples take a while to load. It takes about 3 minutes for full boot when loading a custom kit of 2-4 second samples. So power it on and load your kit BEFORE your set starts.                
I am using this device to run samples for a live band. Such as the FX track for "Living Dead Girl", More Human than Human" & "Pornstar Dancing"....Simple to use & looks cool. The pads have a back light for each.                
Drum machines, especially items such as the StreetBox and the XR20 are tough sells in the age of samplers.  While the XR20 has 700 sounds, each of which can be tuned higher or lower, you're still stuck with those 700 sounds.
I honestly wasn't overly impressed with the sound palette.  The first night I had the machine, I sat down and worked through all of the sounds and put my own kit together.  The sad part about this is, I had trouble picking 12 sounds for my custom kit...not because there were so many great sounds, but because I felt there were so few.
The XR-20 is setup with 3 channels of MIDI, "Drums, One Shots and Synths".  Some of the one-shot sounds are pretty nice, but there aren't enough of them to be very flexible.  They give you two guitar chords when you wish you had 3 or 4.  The downside to these one-shots is that they'll be overused and outdated in notime.  Leaving you with a machine where only the Drums and Synths are useable.
The synths are OK.  They aren't groundbreaking or especially exciting.  Comparing the selections of sound in the XR-20 to the venerable Boss DR-5...the Boss wins hands down.  Then again, the Boss retailed for around $500 more than 10 years ago...so given the price of the XR-20 I guess it's ok.                
I've owned a few drum machines in my day, Sequential Circuits, Roland, Boss...but the XR-20 is the first Akai machine I have owned.
The XR-20 has all of the common features in a drum machine that you've come to expect.  You can tune each sound to your liking, you can put together your own kit of the sounds you like.
I think where the machine really excels is in the Akai sequencer.  Akai has made a name for itself with the MPC series of samplers/sequencers.  I've never owned an MPC so I can't say that the XR-20 is LIKE an MPC sequencer but I'd imagine that it is.  Obviously you can adjust your quantize to wherever you want it.  The unit has a "swing" feature that works alright in some situations.  But there is something about how this unit sequences that give the drums a certain natural groovy feel when compared to a 100% software sequencer like Cakewalk Sonar.
Another feature that I have grown to love is the "repeat note".  I use it frequently when laying down hi-hats, to minimize the wear and tear on the pads and also to keep everything in-time.  You can come up with some ridiculous hi-hat riffs using the repeat function.
The way the XR-20 stores patterns is in an A/B + FILL configuration.  So you can easily pop between pattern A and a variant pattern B while also throwing in a FILL whenever you want.  I'm not sure how useful this is in the studio...it might be geared more towards a live DJ who incorporates some of his own beats into the set.
As someone else already mentioned, the pads are backlit with a nice neon-blue color.  They flash when the pad is pressed or sequenced.  This looks really flashy and impressive, but it's not overly useful.  It would look great next to a DJ on a live set.
enough on that...                
The unit is fairly easy to operate.  Many of the menu buttons are dual-purpose and serve to toggle between one type of menu or the other.  I found this to be a little confusing at times and it's probably just a situation where I need to adjust from one machine to another.  
I'm not particularly fond of how the XR-20 measures out its' pattern length.  It has a default of 8 which is actually 4-4/4 measures.  Dropping it down to 4 turns the pattern into 2-4/4 measures.  I'm not sure of the logic here and I haven't bothered trying to understand it yet...but be aware.
The unit seems fairly well built.  I am a little concerned about some of the smaller menu buttons and how long they'll hold up to abuse.  On the flipside, the DR-5 is still going strong after all of these years and the XR-20 actually seems better built than the DR.
In any case, I'd still be careful with the unit.                
I put the value at about the halfway mark.  For some people, $300 is not alot of money to spend on a new piece of equipment...for others, that $300 investment needs to last.
When I say "last", it's not only the physical aspects of the machine, but the sounds that it makes.  Will the sounds in the XR-20 be as useable today as they could be in 5 or 10 years?  NO.
This is where the XR-20 falls flat on its' face.  I think this machine will be pretty darn good for the next couple of years, but if you are very serious about making beats, I'd recommend holding out and getting yourself an entry level sampler.                
I haven't needed to contact Akai support for any reason so I cannot comment on this.                
It's a decent piece of gear to add to the arsenal.  If you're strapped for cash and want a decent machine, you could go with this or maybe buy something from the secondary (used) market.                
I can see myself using this machine for years and years to come.  Only because I've got it linked up with the DAW so I can lay down some drums on the XR-20 and then pipe the MIDI into the computer and assign different hits in GURU.  This is a nice little setup, but it's not perfect.  If the XR-20 had 4x4 pads, it would be unbeatable.  3x4 pads is kind of unorthodox.
If this unit was lost or stolen or destroyed...I definitely wouldn't rush out to replace it.  It's not an integral piece of my workflow.                
Good quality sounds!  Make for fun beat outlines and quick beat idea's.  I use it conjunction with my MPC 2500                
It is great for a little drum machine.  For $299, you wont find a more fun and easy to use Drum Machine!                
Simple, I did not read the manual at all, and I got it in less than 30 minutes!                
Its Akai/Numark!  I have never had beef with them on quality.  It is plastic though!  It has a shiny glossy black plastic top that will certainly get scuffed up!                
Awesome fun little unit for $299!  I did not plan on getting one, but played with it at GC, and could not resist!                
Been good to me through the years!                
FUN AS HELL!                
Get it, it will make beat making fun!  I use for mobile use, outlines and drum tracks in conjunction with my MPC2500LE and Fantom X and Motif XS.  It is great to take on trips or wherever, use with batteries and make music where I did not b4!                
Ok lets start off by. the sound. The drum & bass sounds are all pretty much nice. The synth sounds are not all that great. Most of em sound like something out of a nintendo super mario video game which might not be bad for some.                
power supply,manual,midi in midi out so you could use it as a controller i guess. mic input which is not all that great at all. You cant even hear your voice all that well with it plugged in bc theres no kind of amp pushing your mic sound. Pretty dumb idea on their part  having a mic input with no kind of phantom power built in just use a mixer.                
This thing is so simple my 10 year old lil brother could make beats out of it but like i said there needs to be way more synth sounds and better sounding ones. More piano and strings would of been nice bc they sound the best on this thing so do alot of the bass sounds.                
built great so far but it isnt built like a tank looks like you gotta take care of it & never drop it bc it seems like it would break easy.                
i think it's ok but it lacks in some areas. I think with an upgrade it could be even better. Hopefully this is just the first xr-20 maybe we'll see an xr-23 in 3 years.                
never dealt with em & i dont plan on to but i gotta 2 year warranty just in case.                
it's ok not something that will knock your socks off.                
i'll probably be ok with this product for a few years till they make a newer and better one.                
Technically, the 16 bit, 44.1 kHz sample playback engine sounds great - no noise or grittiness. The lows thump your chest and the highs are crystal clear. The 700+ sample sound set covers all contemporary music genres: Hip Hop, Glitch, Techno, Synth Pop etc.                
Nice built-in effects (assignable per pad), tap tempo, note repeat, 10 -digit keypad, runs on AC or AA Batteries (x6), back-lit drum pads. Of course the only thing this box is missing is sampling capability - but this not what this drum machine is about. I docked the machine one point because while the pads are velocity sensitive, the truth of the matter is that they will only output 1 of 2 velocities (soft and hard). You have some control over the actual velocity values (MIDI velocity values) sent out the MIDI port, but you're stuck with a soft and loud hit only - not true velocity sensitivity in my opinion.                
Frankly, I haven't had so much fun with a drum machine in a long time. I've owned dozens since the early '80s, including MPCs. This instrument is so easy to use straight out of the box, you'll be making beats in no time and looking up at the clock to see that 4 hours have passed and you haven't even cracked the manual yet. Everything is where is should be, and everything works like you expect it to. Kudos to Akai for their attention to detail.                
No issues here. Though I wouldn't say its built like a tank, you don't have the concern that it would break after a few years of pounding. In fact, I like the pads on this machine BETTER than the pads on Akai's entry-level MPCs like the MPC 1000 and 500. They just feel right.                
A steal at $299.00 (street price). Pocket change. What are you waiting for, buy one already!                
From the moment Akai introduced this at Winter NAMM, I couldn't wait for it to be release. I'm glad its making it into stores now (May-June 2008), rather than Akai making us wait almost a whole year after announcing the product (like with the MPK49 - which I also have and love).                
I've been playing with mine for over a week, and the honeymoon is still not over. Sure, the backlit pads are a gimmick to some, but I find it helps to see the flashing patterns to know what drums are triggering in a particular pattern - plus it just looks cool. Add to that the fact it can be run on batteries (6 AA Batteries last about 5 hours - so get rechargables!), and I can see taking this everywhere.                
I bought this to make different types of music and all this thing sounds like is hip hop, hip hop, and hip hop. Not one house kit, not one clean sine-wave style kick. It's all phat garagey sounding music.                
I hear this thing has effects.                
Pretty easy                
Made well.                
If your on a budget and want to play $300 for 650 individual sounds... I blew through the library in under 30 mins just listening to all the different sounds.                
I'm assuming they got a great support team.                
I don't like one thing about this product. I wanted to make house music and the kicks aren't for house music. They are way too phat. I could of used a couple of claps from this machine but it's worth it. If you wanna make house or techno look somewhere else. It's too RNB and hip hop.                
I read all the reviews before purchasing the AKG c214 and I will tell ya.....its everything I could have expected and more......Great Mic well worth the money....Buy it from Zzounds...There customer service is top notch, fazt shipping and they have great payment plans. Thanks zzounds!!!!!!                
best sounding silky smooth mic i own on my deeper voice and guitars                
shockmount wind screen                
light and very well made...                
got a price match and saved some cash...                
never used before                
looks fine                
good to hvae different mics                
I've had this microphone for the past month and it has been my main mic for tracking vocals. It has a great tonal quality to it and when coupled with my UA 710 micpre I'm able to track solid vocals.                  
WOW!!!! This is a "Great" product!!! "I couldn't believe, the sound that was coming from it". This microphone, "Takes recording to the next level".                
I received this microphone a few days ago. Packed well, no damage, well done zZounds.com. The microphone sounds great, a vast improvement over my previous microphone (blue baby bottle). The build quality is excellent, feels very sturdy. I am very pleased with this Mic thus far. I'm well aware of the fact that each microphone is different and responds differently to individual artists, I've tried quite a few microphones and this suited my vocal sound and style, the Blue was a great microphone, I was just not overly pleased, personal preference plain and simple. I can not find any reason to deter anybody from buying this microphone.                
For the money this mic is a great addition to every home studio. I have been very pleased with the sound on both slower and hard rock applications.                
I previously used the "Blue Yeti Pro" for recording for the past year and a half, and after using the AKG C0214 for the first time, I was blown out of the water on the sound quality difference!! Absolutely a great purchase!!                 
I bought this Mic a few months ago from zZounds and it is one sweet mic...It has a nice bump in the high end, but its NO Chinese mic at all, its an Austrlia Mic and has one smooth Pro sound.... I use this and My SM7b on vocals....this is smoother for slower songs....GET IT you wont be a sorry person....A+++++++++++++++++                
Bubblicious is the first word that comes to mind since this is a mouthfull of juicy sound for your ears my freinds. it is great with vocals, sounds superb and im only running it through my basic dm3200 preamps, let alone when i run it through a presonus.                
For this price Its a steal                
turn it on, read the manual for some good recording tips and try it out!                
Bomb, it feels tuff, the shockmount works realy well.                
its basicaly a c414 with some features missing, but its all the same components, 10                
theres allot of mics i want                 
Pends for what your using it for, sounds delicious on bongo drums too, 9 it is.                
I love options and this mic has 'em!! I record flamenco guitar and an occassional percussive instrument. I will definitely be getting another one in the near future. This mic is also great for mid/side recordings!!                
The multiple patterns are worth having as options. Its like have a couple of mics in one!                
This microphone and a nice preamp can get you an awesome sound! I use a FMR RNP preamp with this mic and a SM 81 for stereo or m/s recordings.                
Seems like a sturdy mic as far as quality, since I dont plan on banging it against something anytime soon, but it seems like it can hold its ground.                
Definitely worth it! Will be getting another one soon!                
Havent had to use 'em.                
Wow factor-the way it captures my sound, enough said! Just get one..                
Killer mic!! Period.                
whoever rated this mic only 1 must be totally deaf or they don't know what they are doing. this mic is made for room acoustics.                
Great microphone!!. I used this to record vocals for my album. In the manual, its recommended to use for back up vocals, however I used it for lead vocals. I just used the recommended settings. Anyway, Its little more linear than 414 XLII version. I was looking for a good mic that was very linear and works great with pre amp/compressors. The AKG 414 XLS is one of the few mics on the market that is close to a linear frequency response for a reasonable price. Comes with a case, pop filter and shock mount. No external power needed as well. Its high quality and works excellent for booth recording. The main characteristic of this mic is that it has a sensitive proximity effect. A vocalist or engineer might have to do a couple of takes to become one with the mic, especially perfectionist. A vocalist or lyricist would have to know how to control there vocals, wind and pronunciations. Once you get the hang of it, its very controllable and cool to use. I would recommend using a compressor and EQ console with this mic before you send it into your DAW. Comes out smooth and rich. Isolates very well in studio booths. So glad zZounds offers payment options with free overnight shipping. Can't beat that!!                
I have been mixing since the 80's , I've used everything on toms from  md421's to 57's, to beta 98's and even more expensive condensers.....and a dozen others.....this mic is the sleeper mic that does tom toms really, really well, I love the way this mic sounds on live toms, and you won't cry if a drummer beats the hell out of it.... buy a dozen....I use it everyday on tour now.                
I purchased this for kick drum and it delivers extreemly well for the price.  It sounds like the kick drum.  No artificial bass boost or anything.  Which for a lot of people who do not know how to tune, muffle or do mic placement on a kick drum is probably not good.  U an a ori drunner with more than 40 years experience so I know how to make my kick sound right.  For me this one is great,                
Simple, integrated stand adaptor.  I prefer a seperate clip.                
Like I said, it sounds much like the source that it is recording.  If your drum sound sucks this thing will not help                
Real solid build, typical AKG.  It can really take the high SPLs.  Realy nice finish and solid wind screen                
Yea, I wish I had the money for a nicer mike, but for the bucks I would buy it again.  I got mine on sale for 69.99.  Not sure I would have aid 100 for it at the time but now that I have it I would say it is worth the 100                
I will probably replace it for kick at some point but I am sure that it will just move to the 16 tom and I know that I will love it there.                
I've run sound for over 20 years using many brands of microphones.  This mic is crisper and cleaner than any other vocal mic I've ever used.  Even non musical people can hear the difference.                
This is a beautiful mic for the money, open, airy. I own three and am planning to buy a couple more, I've replaced the Shures I was using for stage mics. Everybody sounds better through these.                
It's a basic dynamic mic so not much in the features dept.                
Even singers with less than mic technique seem to do well with the D5 (it picks up sound well from a distance, very sensitive).                
Again, this rating is for a $100 mic, I think these are made in China, but they seem pretty sturdy, I've had one of my D5s for at least 2 years or so, no problems, still sounds great.                
Great mic for the money                
I think it's a nice looking mic, has a good heft to it, so those things add to its "sex appeal".                
I feel like I have found my mic and I've been a musician for 25+ years.                
They sound great and have a lot of depth and body.                
They come complete with mic holders and mounts                
Very easy to use once you know what to expect                
Very well made and rugged enough for touring                
This is the best price vs. performance package available.                
Have not needed that yet                
One you use them the wow factor comes from what people say about the drum sound. Wasn't expecting that but when several drummers come up and ask you what you are using, you know it's giving you what you were looking for.                
As a professional drummer with over 40 years of experience touring, recording and producing, I'm pretty picky about what kind of sound I get from my drum mics. I have used almost every conceivable combination of mics on the market and know the characteristics of most of them. There are great road warrior mics that have stood the test of time and touring as well as fantastic, but often times very pricey and fragile, studio mics and lots of things that fall somewhere in between. I play many different styles of music from small jazz combos to a large 20 piece contemporary big band as well as heavy rock bands. I use 5 different sets of drums of various configurations, sizes and sounds, so I need something that can mic them all effectively.When it comes to recording I generally use whatever that particular studio has available as that’s what their engineers are familiar with and I leave it up to their discretion. Most studios I work in have very high end gear. But for live shows, I want to have something strong and consistent because you never know what you are going to run into with house sound systems and often times you need to use your own P.A. so I need a great set of drum mics. My old set was getting a bit beat up so, I was looking for a good set of mics that would do the job but not cost a fortune. I checked out pretty much everything on the market and decided to give these new AKG mics a shot.I have used them for about two month now and they are terrific. They are very live mics and pick up the tonal characteristics of each drum spectacularly. Since using them I have had numerous people from the audiences come up and comment on how great the drums sound, and that doesn’t usually happen. The sound guys I’ve worked with have all praised them and were surprised by how effective all the mics were and how well they integrated together. But, I do have this to say. They are pretty HOT mics, especially the bass drum mic, so you need to warn your sound guy about the before you sound check them. If he has it set to what he’s used to with a bass drum mic, it’s going to distort and he’ll freak out. If he dials it in from scratch, it’s an awesome mic and he’ll love it.I would, and have recommended this set of mics to anyone who wants a great set at a good price. They are well built and road worthy, come in a nice travel case and sound amazing. They really do live up the AKG legacy. Buy ‘em.                
I bought this mic set for two reasons; I have owned, a great many mics and these are a fantastic value. These mics are "hot' in that they do not require much or any gain depending on the mixing board you might be utilizing. When the mics are run through processors they are simply stellar. Great Value for the $$.                
Simply excellent. Wide soundstage, not that much as K702, but great. Trebles are little higher, but nothing disturbing. Bass is fine, even in subsonic level and middles are well-blended between these.                
5m coiled/3m straight cable and changeable cushion is excellent thing. Most of the time I use 5m cable with soft cushion.                
Once you put them on your head and hit the play (or rec) button, you can enjoy nothing but natural sound. So yes, just put them on and press play.                
They are durable even if they don't look like durable. The construction is pretty sturdy and well-made. And most importantly - Made in Austria                
Yes definitely! It's worth every cent you've put into this. I'd say don't waste money on K702 or any other headphones, but that's just my opinion.                
no need                
WOW! Simply great!                
I've tried many, many, many headphones from $50 to $600. Just to name a few - AKG K702, K701, K271, K171, Koss PRO4AAT, MV-1, Beyerdynamics DT-770, .....
Nevertheless I like these most. Why? Because they're good for everything. Not excellent in every area, but well balanced. For instance K702 has crisper, little more detailed sound and wider sound stage, but zero isolation, making it unusable even in quiet outdoors or during recording. Same with K701. The K271 sound is concentrated on mids, they may be a little more detailed, however the sound stage is much more narrow (price for better isolation). Koss PRO4AAT are very flat, however very uncomfortable to wear for longer periods. DT-770 as well as some other BD are not very good in trebles, the sound is somewhat laser-shaped. 
These K240 are:
 - semi-opened - at least some isolation and some sound stage
 - very comfortable - unlike the AATs
 - easy to drive - 55Ohm!
 - performs well even in outdoor use (sometimes even better than closed headphones, because the isolation is not that strong - less bass gain from outside)
- not cheap, but well-priced :-) 
- durable - they withstand almost anything (even rain)
- more quiet when recording than K70x . While there may be some leakage to microphone, these headphones proved themselves excellent when recording wind instruments 
- comes with two cords and two cushions, excellent                
These phones have a very accurate response; I cannot detect LF bumps or HF peaks.  Great for pleasure or critical listening. I love these for what I do. 
The semi-open design can enhance listening experience, but can be problematic when in use as monitors in loud sessions where performers are working near sensitive mic's.  I can recommend the AKG 240S for those applications.
They are simply plug and play.  These are comparatively light in weight.                
While not luxerious,  they are elegant and similar in qulaity to my older versions that have lasted for more than 15 years in my studio.                  
If desire accuracy, these are a great choice in or above this price range.                 
I have not had to use AKG support. That is great.                
I own many sets of headphones both less and more expensive than these.  The 240 is my "go to" choice for 95% of my uses.                  
As I stated before, I have owned several the 240 series for many years, they continue to provide outstanding service. My newer 240's promise to to do the same.  Note that my new models sound a bit cooler than the older ones,  I would expect a break in period to resolve this very minor issue.  Other brands seem to demand an adjustment period when I first put them on.  With the AKG's I feel immediately comfortable, and can relax with confidence regarding the electro/convective signal path to my ears.  
Listening to AKG K240MKII, I notice less gain in the sound level compared to my AKG K77 Close-Back Headphone which cost much less. If you are expecting increase db gain on a Semi-Open Headphone this is not the best choice. Perhaps a Close-Back would be a better choice.                
I would say that the sound quality of these AKG phones is good. I wouldn't say they are a stellar set but for a hundred dollars they are a good value. They represent the music very well with a great balance of highs, mids and lows, although I would like just a little more on the low end. I am using them as a monitor for vocal practice. They are connected to a Berhinger PMP100 mixer which is connected to my laptop. I am singing to music with the vocal tracks removed and have not yet used it with my instruments nor have I used them in a live situation so I cannot attest to their performance in that setting. If I could change one thing it would be to add an in-line volume control and mute button.                 
They came with a screw-on 1/4" adapter which is nice. You know you won't have any disconnect problems with the adapter. My favorite feature of these headphones is a removable, locking cable that locks into place! It is much like a mini XLR connection. No more having to toss a pair of headphones because the cable is shot and no more splicing! Just order a new cable, click it into place, and away you go!                 
They're headphones. You put them on your head. Not a difficult task so ease of use is pretty obvious!                
The first thing you notice is that these are awesome looking headphones! The black and gold colors make them an almost elegant looking pair. They are very well put together and I do not foresee any mechanical issues. I believe these will be a dependable set of headphones that I will get many years of use from.                
I believe they are well worth what I paid for them. I have never paid much for headphones in general. I usually just got a 50 dollar or less set from a local retailer or occasionally a pair would come with something I purchased, so for me these are the most expensive headphones I have ever purchased. I have nothing else in this price range to compare them to but, I would say they are definitely worth the price I paid.                 
I have not needed to seek support so far, so my rating is based solely on what I know about zZounds and their excellent support and customer service.                
Sex appeal? These headphones are as sexy as they get if you could call headphones sexy! They are beautiful black with gold and physically great looking. They are self adjusting which I usually do not like but, these fit great and feel "right" on my head. They are also very comfy on my ears.                
I plan on using these headphones in one capacity or another for many years because they just seem to be a well built, comfortable set. They are definitely the best headphones I have owned so far. However, I am one of those people who buy something with the intention of upgrading somewhere down the road. I do this with every piece of musical equipment I buy with one exception.. my guitar! So far it's the only thing I have that I consider to be the "Ultimate" instrument or piece of equipment that simply has no superior.
I can honestly say that the AKG K240S Studio Headphones are the most comfortable, nicest looking phones I have ever owned. Add an in-line volume/mute control and you would have the ultimate headphones in this price range
These are by far the best headphones that I have ever owned. I've previously tried Audio Technicas and Sonys, and lower quality AKGS, and these make the others look like child's play. They were my most trusted companions as a home recordist... i've spent HOURS and HOURS with these things, mixing and mastering (yes, they are that good. I'd trust them as much as my monitors for checking if a mix is sweet or not). The reason I'm writing this review is because I just broke them... accidentally ripped the cord out of the socket (i wasn't wearing them... it was tangled around my leg). I'm heartbroken.                
The idea to have a switchable cable is ingenious. Never had to replace mine, even though it went through hell (it was all taped up).                
Fatigue? Forget about it. The only way you'll get fatigued with these things is when they bring out all the mistakes in your playing and your mix, and you get frustrated with yourself.                
Made in Austria. Can't beat it. These have lasted me YEARS, and they were still sounding sweet. The leather around the ears had started to crack and flake, but do you know how many hours i've spent with these damn things on my head? about as long as the average american has spent vegitating in front of the tube.                
I bought these so long ago that I forgot what I paid for em... a hundred bucks???? This things are a steal. They will be the best hundred bucks you can spend... if you're some newbie recording enthusiast and deciding whether to blow a hundred bucks on some crappy china mic or these, definitely get these. They will reveal flaws that  you will have to learn to deal with and will make your recordings so much better than some stupid cheapo mic. I just wish I could afford the K700 somethings or whatever the brand new ultimate model is (those suckers are $500 but i've heard that listening through them is like hearing the voice of god)                
Never had to deal with 'em. The best support situation should be a product that's so good you never have to find out what kind of music they play when they put you on hold.                
I'm on the verge of crying because I've lost them. i've lost a dear friend, all thanks to my stupidity.                
Treat em nice, kiddos. They deserve it. A true A+ workhorse.                
These are the headphones you see littering recording studios for a reason. They work. They're neutral, they don't spill too much, they're robust and most of all, they let you hear what's actually being recorded. You can literally wear them all day and not get either physically or aurally fatigued. Lots of bottom end, but it's not going to flatter the mix. You take them off and what's coming out of the monitors is amazingly close. The replaceable cord is a great touch. Basically, they're The Ones. You can mix in them as long as you check your work on monitors (all headphones are misleading when it comes to center-placed sounds). Lovely things. Up there with Fender and Gibson guitars.                
They're headphones, and they have a straight replaceable cord. I don't know what else you would need. The jack at the end is 1/8", but an adaptor to 1/4" was supplied with mine. Good quality too.                
You plug them in and put them on. Nothing to adjust. They just fit.                
Amazing value. About the best $100 you can spend on your studio, up there with the Studio Projects B1.                
Never needed any support.                
You want it.                
You could buy more expensive phones but the gains would be marginal and you would not use them as the workhorse that you use these as.                
I bought these headphones, finally, after hearing them side by side with maybe 12 other brands at Long&McQuade 3 months ago. They are simply supirior so anything ellse that was there, some phones were so uncomfortable you cant stand them on your head, and besides these simply sounded better. Most phones emphisized some tone and did not create the proper clarity and space needed for imaging. these phones fit like a glove and they dont become annoying for at least a few hours.. There IS some midbass and bass tones that stand out, when compared to bang&olufsen earbuds, however this shouldnt present a problem.                 
Fit great , Sweeeeeeeeet to look at . comfortable, no adjustments at all which is a good thing. 1/4" and mini jack, and detachable cord.                 
i cant see these dying anytime soom but who knows.                
best value, im 16 and i wash dishes at $8.50 an hour , looked around for months and decided on these.. there ya go.                
the retailer i got them from is great                
all gold and sexy. nice                
all good                
Perfect, uncolored sound.  Flat response.                
I like that they now have a detachable cord.  I was constantly worried about running over the cable or pinching it between my chair and desk.  It is comforting to know that it can now be more easily replaced.                
Plug in -- put on head -- listen -- simple enough?                
My old pair is over 10 years old and working great.                
You can spend triple on an inferior product.  $100 may be a daunting price for a casual user, but it is a bargain to anyone with a keen set of ears.                
If "N/A" was a voting option I would have selected it.  I have not had to contact support because I have never had a problem with the headphones.                
hey...  how sexy can headphones be that cover your ears and make you look like Mickey Mouse?                
I always recommend these to my friends that want high quality headphones for recording or listening to music at work.  Often they will buy something sexier or less bulky...  but they almost always find fault in what they have purchased and buy these in the long run.  There is a reason why nearly every picture you see of someone in a professional studio setting is wearing these.  They are the industry standard...  possibly the best headphones you can buy...  CERTAINLY the best for the money.                
amazing, i own event 20/20 bas monitors and the sound coming out of both are very similar, i can actually make music at night now without pissing off my neighbors and not worry about how the mix is gonna sound, but dont get me wrong i still think you should check your mixes on ever system you come across, but these headphones have given me peace of mind, plus they actually sound flat so you know what goes in is what comes out                
headphones!?!?!? what do you want..........                
these look sturdy very well built                
$100 come on, i actually had the chance to demo some other headphones like sony's and sennheiser's they dont come close                
dont need them                
i have it                
the best $100 dollars i've spent so far                
Excellent Sound, I use these for Mixing and Mastering, and can Honestly Say I'm very impressed.
Every so often They go Missing, and I Find either My son using them with his electric Guitar, or mY Daughter using them to listen to her.. whaterver it is she lsitens to!                
I like the detachable cord, and the screw jack..                
Plug 'em in put 'em on listen..                
So far so good after over 2 years I have no complaints                
Great value for The Money, I've paid a lot more for lesser quality Headphones!                
Really have No Issues, Great Quality, and good value for the money, Go Ahead and Buy Them you won't be dissapointed                
You see these cans everywhere. In the background of "The Art of Sixteen Bars." In the ending credits to "Bioshock: Infinite." Matt Stone and Trey Parker record South Park voices with these. There are certainly better cans out there, but they are marginally better for twice, three, four times the price, and the gains aren't worth it. If you're looking for quality cans, these are at the top of your list. I have had a pair for six years, and that pair recently gave out after they fell off my desk and I accidentally stepped on them (REALLY HARD) trying to pick them up (it happens). I immediately put in an order for a new pair. I wouldn't be caught dead in the studio without them on my head. Very true-to-source monitoring, solid construction (six years of brutal abuse that those horrendous Beats by Dre headphones wouldn't have lasted five minutes under), and unbelievable aesthetic quality. I'm responsible for at least a dozen of these being purchased.  One listen, whether its in the studio or just music on the street, and you know these things are beastly. These are the real deal. For the price, you're insane if you don't already have them, and you're a joke if you're not considering them.                
I bought the AKG 240s to replace a set of AKG 240M monitors I owned for more than 20 years!!  AKG makes a superior product and when the old set gave out I KNEW I had to replace them with the same kind.  Simply no other for me!  The 240 series has always been, and still is "Pro" quality, used as monotors in professional studios.  This is understandable.  The response it brilliant and the quality is excellent.  The semi open design allows me to converse with others without taking them off and they are very comfortable to wear, even for extended periods of time.  The 20 year old 240 monitors were 300 ohms where these are 55 so it took a bit of getting used to the deeper bass response but it didn't take long after an only minor adjustment to my equipment.  I'm an amatuer songwriter and this works well with my gear.                
The reason my 240 monitors quit was a short in the cable. That won't be such a big deal with this model because the cord is detachable and can be replaced without replacing the entire set of phones.  The cord is also 4 feet longer that it's predecessor, giving you 10 feet instead of 6.  My 8 track recorder uses a stereo phone plug where my PC where I mix uses a mini cable.  No problem.  The set includes a stereo phone plug adapter which screws over top of the default mini plug.                
Couldn't be easier.  Just plug it in and listen!                
Considering that my previous set of AKGs lasted 20 years, I'm not worried about their longevity.  The design was obviously made to last a long time.                
Yes!  The 240s are worth every penny.                
Actually, I couldn't tell ya.  I never needed support for this product, but experience has always told me that superior product=superior service.                
The slick black & gold color is very professional looking.                
As I said above, I expect to be enjoying this product for years to come, based on previous experience with the manufacturer.                
I purchased these to add to my existing collection of headphones and for tracking vocals in a garage studio. I'd used the K240M for a time some years back and found them to be good for tracking as well as checking mixes. The build quality and sound of the lower priced version surprised me and I like them so much I may purchase the MK2 as well. The 240 series are a studio standard and most people who use them find they hold up well. There are other phones that sound good and aren't super expensive, but in my opinion they aren't as accurate and generally don't hold up well in a studio enviornment.                
These are without question a clear, crisp set of headphones that will do all you need them to do in the studio, no false bass (like Beats) or muddiness.  You'll see these in many pro studios, there's a reason why.                
They have a very crisp and unbiased sound. Perfect for recording.                
Standard fare. 1/4 adapter. Mini XLR cable.                 
Just put them on.                
The headphones seem pretty sturdy though the cable seems a bit cheap but easy to replace.                
These are possibly the best headphones in their price range.                
Haven't needed any.                
The black and gold look is quite appealing but the sound is the main attraction.                
I don't see myself upgrading for a while. If these were broken or stolen I would probably buy another pair.                
Love them. Great sound and range, comfortable and solid. For the price, a must-buy.                
really good, clean sound and so light you will forget your wearing them. I like how it pops when you have instruments playing too high. Money well spent                
I bought this headphones not because I need it them to make any recording, but to listen to music on my cell phone. This is not what I was looking for! however, if I was looking for a pair of monitors to record lyrics for any of the songs I ever recorded this will definitely would have been the choice. 
It does exactly what a headphone (monitor) should do. You can perfectly listen to the music and to your voice when recording, this way you don't have to take one earphone off to listen to yourself. 
In my experience this are a good quality headphones. Not the best, but not the worst. The price is right, and the style is really off the wall.                
Very clean sounding reference headphones.   If want to blast your eardrums into oblivion with bass these are not for you.  If you want to hear details in the mix, then these are a best buy for the money!                
I've owned them all over the years Beyer, Sennheiser, Grabo, almost every model AKG has ever made, and the pair that shine above the rest, by far, are my 28 year old K-240 Studios. The good news is, they still make them and when I A/Bd the old set and a brand new set, they were almost identical. 
Sure the 28 year old set is more open, and lighter on top with more body/bite on the bass end, but I'm confident the new set will get there after burning them in for a few hundred hours.  
If I had 1 set of headphones to choose, out of everything out there now and I had an unlimited budget, I'd still trust a pair of $100 [street price] K-240s over anything else. Give me a set of vintage NS-10s and a pair of K-240s and I'll mix anything, anywhere.  Literally the best headphone for the money, in the world.  Period                
These are comfortable earphones that completely cover the ears. Good sound reproduction. They work as advertised!                
Very Detailed and resolving, deep bass, but needs a good headphone amp or at least a mixer to fully bring out it's good qualities.  Slow bass without an amp, but with an amp it quickens up.                
it included the 1/4 to 1/8" adaptor, I wish it had a thicker cable                
it is made very well, but the cord could have thicker insulation on it                
It's actually worth the full list price, the selling price is a comparative steal.                
the company was really friendly at answering questions arising before the sale.  I havent' had to deal with them further.                
These headphones are probably the best sounding I've ever had.  The sound is well balanced over all ranges, and I can hear everything that's in the audio.  Keep in mind though (you probably realize this already), your laptop isn't really enough to drive these.                  
I love the detachable mini-XLR.  Great feature if you use headphones a lot, and sometimes step on or trip over chords.                
They feel and look extremely well made.                
They're worth it, but I'm not really a capitalist.                
None needed.                
They look great, feel great, and sound great.  I wouldn't buy any other phones at this price point.                
I don't feel like you can go wrong with these.  I prefer them over my similar Audio Technica phones at the same price point.                
The sound is very good, however the bass is attenuated.  Meaning the bass you hear in the phones is not the true sound on your mix.  I have spent long hours mixing down tracks but then to find out the bass was all wrong.  if it sounds really bassy you might mix the bass lower, but then to find out once you listen to it on your stereo that the bass is all gone!  However i rate these a 9 because I don't use these for mixing tracks anymore!  these are best for giving your singers or musicians who are in the studio.  To a singer these will be the best headphones they have ever heard in their life.  The Highs are so crisp and sparkle.  the mids have a lot of character.  Don't use for mixing tracks!  These are perfect for putting on the ears of a vocalist or musician when they need to sound their best!                
Very long cable & 1/8th to 1/4th in adapter.  These sound great in an ipod too!  For this kind of listening it doesn't get any better.                
The speakers and the cable have lasted great for me. I've owned for 5 years, having bought them in 2005.  However, the little plastic part that says 'L' broke off.  Probably my fault, but doesn't effect the sound or comfort at all. =)                
Very valuable.  These will have your musician friends jealous and you will keep picking them up.                
It is very sexy with the gold trim and long cord.                
If it wasn't for the louder-than-they-should-be-low-end, i would rate these a 10.  Don't use to mix with.  Use these while singing, give them to your vocalists & musicians and you will be very very pleased!  These are one of the best Studio headphones you can buy for under $120.                
These headphones have brought so much clarity to my mix and the music I listen to! They even make 160 kb/s mp3's sound respectable!                
Plug them in, put them on your head... Any questions?                
I love the removable cable feature! It may make these last forever..... Normally the first thing to go is the cable.                
Considering how long these may last, and the amazing sound quality, I'd say it was a very good buy.                
They fit completely around your ears... (I hope) The leather padding is very smooth and comfortable. The shiny gold is flashy... They're proud, and huge!                
*Stop reading. Add to Cart*                
Awesome! Awsome! Awesome! I am using a Roland RD-700, and a GW7 keyboards respectively, etc.
The only tip i have to impart to make the device sound better, is, do not turn the volume up to the max!                
Well im no pro musician or anything, but I LOVE these.  The sound is always precise and right on the spot for what im looking for.  Not too high, not too low... but I do recommend finalizing a mix on monitors and not headphones anyways... but as far as i can tell they translate pretty darn well.                
I don't think they are all space agey with switches to set for different features and such, but they do their job well.                
Comfy, light, and funny looking... what else could u ask for?  I can wear em ofr hours without even know they are on my head.  Serious.                
Ok, well this is the one thing that bugs me.  My right earphone is kinda intermitent, but i have dropped this babies 30+ times over the 3-4 years i have owned them.  They still work, i just have to fiddle with the wire for a second each time.  (although, im buying a new pair right now!)                
I think they are amazing.  Seriously.  i paid 150$ for these, $99 for my second, im happy!                
Well... i wasn't happy that they wanted $60 plus shipping both ways to fix these... cause a new pair is only $99.  So i guess now i'l have two.                
I want another.                
For me a hobby musician... I think they cannot be beat.  Although i havent tried others other than Sony, but im sold.                
The best balanced sound I've heard in anything under $100.                
The single sided cord, its ample length and screw-on adapter are exactly what I need.                 
The cans themselves are über-comfortable! The fit is surprisingly secure for such a light feel.                
So far, so good. Solidly built for a lightweight set. The cord is secure and doesn't kink.                
These AKG's are easily worth three times the price.                
Haven't had to deal with them yet. For $40, I doubt I ever will. They break in a few years, I buy new ones. But I don't think that will happen with moderate care.                
Not much WOW in a set of headphones, it's not like I'm expecting a need to add them to my nighttime crimefighting outfit or have them translate Sindarin. The sound is pretty WOW, though.                 
I just received these headphones and they're probably the best sub-hundred-dollar set I've ever had. Clean, balanced and full, they are so far serving every purpose I need them for. Using them to program patches on my DigiTech rp360XP, they tell me exactly what it will sound like through my amp. Listening to music is a pleasure as they cover bass, mids and highs in near perfect balance.
Are there better? Sure. Are there better at this price range? Not even close. I've even used them for monitoring mixes and have zero complaints. I mean, yeah, if you need to hear a hummingbird fart through the mix of a dubstep Metallica remix, go for the $300 headphones. If you need a set that's not a toy and don't have a lot of money, or if you need to outfit a recording studio or rehearsal space with multiple sets of cans, go with these AKG's. I use a TC Helicon Voice Live 2, and during band practice, I can hear a perfect representation of my various reverbs, delay decays and harmony voice balances.
Rating these on parameters other than sound, they fit the bill wonderfully. They are light but sturdy. The cans fit completely over my ears and even wearing my eyeglasses I can barely tell they're there after a couple hours. Complete sound blocking? No. But more than sufficient for average use listening to music, practicing or mixing. The one-side cable is long enough for anything I need it for and a welcome relief from dual-sided cords hanging down my neck and down the front of my body. The handy screw-on 1/4" adapter covers all of my many needs. In short, these cans are great and for $40, I'll replace them if I do break them or something.                 
Ok there only $40 headphone but you'd think they last a day. I put them on to try them out, first they are clunky and not very comfortable. Then when removing them the ear pad fell off. I've had $20 Sony headphones last ten years and given away still working. I guess I expect too much.                
love these headphones! they sound good and crisp good for mixing and mastering brought for my boyfriend he loves it...                
One reviewer said they sounded hollow and lacking midrange. Well that is not true. I don't know if he is listening to rap or hip hop but these excel in the midrange. One thing these headphones do is lay bare a bad mix. I have listened to quite a bit of different kinds of music with these and they expose bad mixes. The highs are clear and airy and the midrange lets you hear instruments that normally get lost in a mix like acoustic guitars and laid back mid tracks. These phones play what was recorded in the mix. I am very impressed with the extended highs and the extended low end. Like I said, these play what was mixed and the midrange is there if it is in the mix of whatever song you are playing. They are a steal at fifty nine bucks!                
These headphones I purchased as a backup. Overall the headphones price point was the best.  The sound quality sound a little hollow and they lacked in the mid-range.                
I personally ordered this mic because i saw microphone parts had an easy upgrade for it (the RK-87 capsule swap). But before i did the swap (about a week after purchase) the mic is pretty nice out of the box, comes with a hard case that isn't included with most microphones in this price range (even some more expensive options). Inside the case there is a really nice shock mount and the p220. The mic out of the box sounds fine just about as good as any other budget LDC, but with the RK-87 capsule swap its crazy, the mic sounds very similar sound to that of a vintage Neumann. If you have a small knowledge of electronics/soldering i highly recommend buying this mic and doing the capsule swap.                
It's an entry level home studio mic but gives a strong semi pro sound. Can be muddy at times but easy to eq out.                 
Lo cut and pad!! These two always come in handy.                 
Just plug in, turn on phantom and enjoy!                 
Very well build sturdy, nice weight, mesh grill looks nice and great shock mount that comes wit it.                 
This mic is a must for any home studio locker. It will surprise you on how good of vocals you can get in a untreated room with this mic. If you need a bang for your buck mic this is it!                 
Haven't had to call them.                 
Looks good!                 
Just starting out look no further this is like having a mustang gt for your first microphone!                 
The mic has a warm sound when recording a string quartet. The musicians are very happy with the sound  the mic produces. It is nice to have the choice of different pickup patterns.                
For all those "purists" who believe you need a cord to maintain your guitar sound, you need to re-think your views. After thoroughly researching many different wireless brands and reading countless forums I was still undecided on what to try. I decided to try the AKG mini due to it's price and reviews. I figured, if I wasn't impressed, I wasn't going to be out a lot of money.
Well....I could not be more impressed or happier I did decide to try this unit. Great sound and ease of use right out of the box. Plus, zZounds shipped quickly and their staff answered all my questions to put me at ease with my first wireless purchase.
I let my lead guitar player friend who is an absolute "tone is everything" guy try it out. He previously owned another wireless brand which cost him $345 which he stopped using due to his loss of "tonal quality". Guess what.....he ordered one of the single mini units on the spot!!
If you've ever wondered about going wireless, buy one of these AKG units, you will be glad you did!!                
The unit gives clear tones to the amp with no loss and the battery lasts a long time. I haven't run any down yet and I've been using it for practice going on a couple of weeks now. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a dependable wireless at a reasonable price. Shipping was super fast.                
Not bad but you can expect some tone loss as with any wireless system. I like being able to have two guitars rigged up with it. My main guitar is on the first channel and my backup guitar is on channel two. If something happens with my main guitar I can flip a couple switches (the on button for the wireless pack, and a input channel select on my tuner and ta-da I am back in business. Thats the coolest thing.                
It works great, on a single AA battery that holds charge for several 3-4 hour shows. 
Sounds great, easy to use. 
The best one for the money                
I purchased a 4 channel AKG 70 reciever and 4 AKG mic's, also 3 akg wms40 mini2 wireless guitar/bass recievers and transmitters. they were shipped to me in a very short time each time i ordered, idid have trouble with one akg70 mic,however with ZZounds 30 day return policy i was able to return the mic with no problem. all are working fine!!!                
not that excited as I thought I would be... a lot of gap in signal dropping off...                
I purchased these mics after looking a lot of reviews. Was debating on whether to go with the Shure wireless or this one. I am so glad I opted for the AKG instead of spending twice the money on the Shure. These mics have plenty of range and sound great! I now have played several gigs using them and can't think of one complaint. Very happy!                
We were looking for a wireless mic, low cost, for our church to use primarily for prayer requests and announcements. We bought the AKG WMS40 and figured we might use the second mic once in awhile. This product does all we need and more! Highly recommend this and buying from zZounds received 2 days after I placed order!                
My wife and I run a karaoke show here in .Ca. We have had several different brands of cordless. From Sure to Sampson. None have earned the praise from our singers like these mic's. Great vocals with pure sound. Very happy with my purchase from zZounds. It was delivered in no time and exactly what we wanted.                
This wireless microphone set performs very well for the price. No hassles whatsoever to simply plug and go. Sound quality if more than acceptable. Two negatives: 1- these do not come with stand clips, so you will have to purchase separately. 2- I ordered separately an AKG rackmount kit to mount this in my travel rack, however that kit is apparently for some European rack standard, and does not fit U.S. type 19" EIA centers. I had to cut, drill and tap a 1U blank plate to finish my install.That said, you will have some really nice quality mics that use off-the-shelf AA batteries (long-lasting) for your wireless requirement.                
When searching for an affordable wireless mic system  we only looks to AKG and Zzounds. Really impressed the singers with the great sound and light weight. Originally purchased two units and had signal issues but Zzounds was there and returned one unit for full credit for a similar set with different frequency. Any online shopping for sound equipment is done here at Zzounds!                
Received the microphones in time for a Christmas church social; they were easy to connect and use with my Bose L1 Compacts and Tone Match Engine. We had roving MC's who mingled with the audience and the mikes picked up all over the venue. Great value!                
These mics are very very professional and hold up awesome!! SOUND AMAZING!                
The system is a good system, but it does some static interference when you are moving from place to place, the sound is good quality, but the static noise is not acceptable in the professional work.
The mini box did not meet my exportations.
Other no good thing is the two steps swich,if you put it in off a horrible static noise will come on from the box, and already blow one channel of our mixer amp that we have to fix now.
I love AKG wireless but im very concerned about the state of wireless mics with the new federal rules for the frequency range. The mics that came in were cool, but given the mics I already have, plus the way our building is designed I found that they really didn't work like I wanted. I'm pretty sure that the mics were fine, just needed to have the higher quality ones. These mics should work well for well insulated, non-metal roofs with uncrowded frequencies.                
Overall, the mics are of a decent quality.  I wished that they would have XLR outs.  The other issue is that when the receiver is on and you turn off the mic (not mute, but completely off) there's lots of static.  However, when the mic is on, the transmission is clear.                
When I would turn these off, instead of the receiver muting (as my other units do), it sent LOUD white noise.  Also, during a event, a wedding officiant was about 30 feet from the receiver and static keep interfering.  It was embarrassing.  Sent them back.  Will be looking into the AKG Perception series or back to Shure.                
Wasn't expecting a whole lot for the price but this little unit works quite well and is quiet too. I needed this for my home studio setup but I believe it would work fine for gigging too. Zsounds delivered it very fast and the ordering and communications was first class all the way. Profesional 30 year guitar studio muscian. I will put zZsounds first on my list for my musical needs. Have not needed any support so far KUDOS too zZsounds and AKG for making a sweet little unit.                
I just received my Mini as an early Christmas gift, GREAT DEAL!!!! Your not going to be able to walk 2 football fields with this thing, and I never do anyway and I gig 3 to 4 times a month.Have not heard any fuzz or static or tone sucker with this thing, ITS WELL WORTH IT!!!!                
Great little unit! I also purchased the rack kit for it. I out it in the top space of my rack, so the antennae extends above the rack for the best reception. Then the antennae is on a swivel so I just put it down when I close the rack up. I play bass in a weekend band. I have used this wireless for 3 gigs now with no trouble or dropouts whatsoever. I'm nit sure about the "30 hour" battery life though. I used it for 2 4 hour gigs, then it sat for a month, in the off position, and when I got to the next gig, the battery died as I was tuning for the gig, so carry some extra batteries with you. I think I am going to order the dual wireless mic system next for the pa system I am building mainly for rehearsals. I am totally satisfied though, and for 100 bucks you can't beat it!                
We bought 2 of these for both guitar players in our band and they work very nicely.
No drop outs at all no matter where you are in the venue, I tried them out before we ever used them live and I could go outside and 50 feet away with the unit in my basement and no signal loss at all. Battery life is unbelievable as well. I used the same battery for 4 gigs and I check it with my VOM before each show and it had a full charge. The only problem is the cable that comes with the unit. Both of them had an issue after the 1st use so we ordered 2 Mogami replacement cables on line and they are way better and we have no issues now at all. For the price, ease of use and quality it is a no brainer. They work very well for us.                
Very nice device. I particularly like the 3-way (off, mute, and on) switch on the transmitter. Very handy receiver setup too. I have used it several times in performances, and it performed well. Remember, though; the transmitter has no automatic turn-off. I inadvertently left it on and trashed a battery. Fortunately, this is no big deal because it uses AAA, not 9V. Regarding my ratings - I have not idea what Manufacturer Support is like. The questionnaire did not give me an 'unknown' option, so I assigned it a 3.                
It works really good. I am pleased by the product, the fact that it sounds real close to using a cable, no delay no hiss just freedom to move and not trip. Transmitter is made of plastic and doesn't feel real strong but that it carefully and it should be fine, I put it in my back pocket or on the guitar strap.                
Fantastic!                
Absolutely the best wireless bass system I've ever used. The battery lasts about 30 hours, and I have no issues with cut outs anywhere in any clubs I play in.                
Researched a bunch of inexpensive wireless sets for use in my home studio and occasional gigs. Settled on the AKG WMS40 based on strong recommendations from other users. Ordered from ZZounds before 2 one day, and had it the next day (ground shipped; not express)! Amazing service. Unit is "as advertised", absolutely plug and play; no clicks, hum, dropouts to report so far. No change in guitar or bass tone from a wired connection as far as I can hear. Very impressive and liberating! Encourage your inner rock star and buy this thing!                
Actually "plug & play" (no hype!); This is a ridiculously inexpensive way to go wireless.Works as advertised; No fidelity loss experienced between guitar and pedalboard so far for me.. Send unit (guitar side) probably a bit too delicate for long term professional use, but very adequate if care is taken. Belt clip is very flimsy and user would probably be better off just dropping the unit in your pocket instead of clip mounting. Battery life (1 X AA) is very good and range for me is good up to about 35' away from receiver. Very liberating!! Buy one now!!                
By no means do I hold this against zZounds but the saying you get what you pay for is true, this thing had so much noise it drove me nuts the first 5 minutes sent it back zZounds refunded me with no questions asked                
i love this wireless it is inexpensive but it has great sound and is stupily reliable even after many drunk drops lol                
useful is you turn it on and voila it just works no putzing around with it                
they sound great buy one or two                
it is made very well the reciever box is well made and is metal and the handset is pretty durable                
definatly worth the money                 
never needed it                
i work in bar settings with drunk karaoke people and if they drop these they stand up and are cheap enough if they do get inviscerated its not a 400.00 mic lol                
ill use these till they die and would definatly buy more                
Have purchased three of these mics for our church for use in our childrens and teen ministries. Have used them all for a couple years now. These mics are moved and hooked up to different mixers constantly for different activities and functions. They've withstood a lot of abuse. I think they have a very good sound and I like the placement of on/off switch on the side of the body f the mic way better than other mics that place a tiny switch on the bottom. The low price caused me to try out these mics. Since they get used inside and outside and in a gym and in a classroom - I don't worry as much about them getting dropped and such as I would a $300-500 mic.My one big complaint - lots of handling noise. When mic is on - you will hear all hand movement on the mic. For this reason, I've never been tempted to use them in our auditorium during our church services. But the handling noise is something that I can easily put up with considering the price and how we use them. Never used manufacturer support, so I wouldn't know how that would go.                
This microphone is very reliable and powerfull. It makes real  reproduction your "own voice'. Half way volume u get more than enough power. It comes with universal power adaptor sothat u could take this anywhare in the world.Transmitor works with 1 aa battery. Small and light weight receiver for room saving and travel friendly. Foldable rubber antenna. Genuine look make you look professional                
My boss ( Who runs a DJ company with several DJ's ) had one of these Mics for me to use for weddings, so I bought one for the gigs I pickup on the side. The sound is Great and is better then wired mics by far. Just make sure you pick a quarter inch cable to plug it into your mixer. Easy set-up and Put away makes it a great purchase and mic for any mobile DJ/MC. Sounds Great! Even one of the ministers comented on the quality of the mic. Worth it!                 
You want a quality, clear sounding, affordable wireless mic? Then this is it right here!
I put this to the test within one week by doing two different venues, where on both occasions, I had to walk quite a distance away from the base and it passed with flying colors each time! I didn't hear one short out, no hissing or anything such. What I did hear was clear voices from me to the bridal party giving toast.
Honestly, for the price you pay for this mic, you can't go wrong! This is truly a great investment for anyone in need of a wireless mic! 
This is a great product. Looks good and feels good to handle. No unwanted noise,or hum being picked up, The sound is as good as my wired Shure mic.I can go from one to the other at the same board settings with no difference in the sound of my voice.Nice steel made ball cap.The body of the mic will pick up minor hand movement is my only fault found.                
Excellent!! Great range last long. Very clear.                
I have used this mic for a year with no problems. Then the static starts happening more and more over time. I changed the battery. I moved the receiver  closer to mic, I tried an extender... I did everything. This  mic did teach me a lot of wireless mic but as a wedding dj, You can afford static during the speeches. So I bought an off brand for $180 called GTD. It has over 400 positive reviews. I dont expect this wmsmini to be on zzounds for very much longer                
We needed a new wireless lavalier. The problem was we run sound only a few times a year, with non-sound guys doing the setup--and it is often needed outdoors, where there may be a long way from the mic to the sound table. The Presenter worked flawlessly from out of the box. Channel setup is easy; no one had any trouble operating the mic; and we had compliments on the sound quality all day long. The only problem we had was it was a very windy day, and we did get some wind noise. A lot of that is automatic with a mic sensitive enough to be a lavalier. We were able to reduce the noise considerably by tucking the mic inside a collar or under a lapel, and still had great sound. Love the product.                
This mic works great.  I use it for officiants at weddings and it works perfect.  I recommend this mic.                
works awesome it's out of the way and sounds great as I do back-up vocals while playing the drums!!                
Very clean and accurate for the price.                 
Small beltpack but large headset. Receiver doesn't have external antennas to get bent.                 
Simple set up.                 
Gave it a 5 since first one got really distorted sounding after 2 weeks.   Zzounds was great about replacing it.   I'll keep my fingers crossed on this one.                 
If it continues to work it's a great value.                 
The 10 goes to Zzounds for excellent customer support!                 
As couple of years.                 
This microphone is AMAZING for the price tag...It's hot as a firecracker & has unbelievable clarity......HIGHLY recommend this product, and will order another one ASAP!!                
Just got this awesome set today. Back like 20 years ago, I bought a Roland Stage set for like $2500 that had all rubber pads. It was a lot of fun. FF to today and this set is amazing. So much more for the dollar. I would put this set up against any $2000 mesh set I've seen / tried. Super high quality parts and pieces. Very easy to use.                 
I have owned a Roland TD9 with upgraded mesh heads before and mesh heads are the way to go which makes this set nice. The cymbals are very cheap looking and are not the best but for the price of the kit it is acceptable. It plays well and the sound is very good. In my opinion I would not go any cheaper when it comes to Alesis drums if you are somewhat serious about playing. Very nice looking set for the price.                
I purchased this kit as a replacement for the KT3 Advanced kit I had. I was skeptical about moving to mesh heads after only ever using mylar and rubber head kits before. I will say that the mesh heads on the DM10 are excellent. The rebound is nice and the overall feel of the heads is on par with all of the other electronic kits I have used. The sound is excellent and the rack is a lot heavier duty than the KT3 kit. Assembly of this kit, while not quick, was pretty straight forward. It assembles much like any other electronic kit out there. I had read some reviews of this kit before purchasing and saw others complaining that the instructions included were not good. While the instructions are short, they do cover the essentials. While this kit won't compete with the high-end Roland kits, you will get your money's worth. 
The drum module for this kit is superb! Alesis did an amazing job in designing the brain that controls this kit. The ability to customize each trigger and the sounds takes you to a level more granular than any I've ever used. 
If I had any reservations about this kit it would be the kick pad trigger. This pad doesn't give you a very sensitive touch. I recommend going with a little bit higher end kick pedal if you want to maximize the kick pad sound. It is as fully customize-able as the other triggers but the pedal will pick up what the trigger is lacking. 
All in all, with a good set of headphones, a nice throne and a decent kick pedal you will be able to rock out with your.....socks out.....for a long time to come with this kit. 
There is one additional small feature that Alesis added to the kit that even my 7 year old loves......each pre-set kit has its own color that lights a backlit led on one of the buttons. This makes it much easier to remember your favorite kit without having to remember the name or number of the kit on the display. Very nice, Alesis! Job well done in my opinion! 
I gave manufacturer support 4 stars only because I haven't had to use it yet. Everything has been superb about this kit thus far!                
There is no support for this kit and it's completely overlooked due to the strike series. The sounds that come with the module are lackluster at best. When adding sounds you should be fine until you try adding a custom hi hat. there's no way to make it both open and closed. so you either get only an open hi hat or a closed hi hat with custom sounds. The only upside is midi but tbh it's not worth it because drumming software is expensive af. My ride cymbal is also hardly responding and I got this kit mid February. I'm not abusive with my cymbals either, and yes my sensitivity is cranked. I don't recommend this kit. You're better off getting a command kit, selling the module and buying a different one, and replacing the cymbal pads. Or y'know, Strike Pro (I should've gotten that instead).                
It is a great kit for recording. Overall, most of the pre programmed kits are very realistic. The only issue is the kick drum. I had to lower my beaters (Below the center/middle) in order to get sound out of it. The trigger is too low. Other than that, I am pleased with the purchase. I found this kit for 799.00 and reported it to zZounds. They counter offered at 791.00 Great deal!                
I bought these because I needed a cheap pair of monitors for my desktop. They sound decent and I really like the tweeters compared to titanium ones because the highs are much smoother. These have a bass boost switch which I don't use because for near field monitors they have a balanced sound without it. Overall a good buy for the money.                
It could just be that I've started off mixing with headphones so now actual speaker playback is amazing lol but I have no complaints, for the pricing (esp. if its through the payment plan) you are getting great quality and sound I love them!                
The Alesis Elevate 5 MKII speakers are an outstanding value. I got two pairs and run all 4 at the same time on a Focusrite Clarett. The speakers are set full volume for ease of use, there's zero hiss or distortion. The music is an electric guitar through vst, and about 25 vst keyboards. There's more separation using various distortion pedals, reverbs, chorus'. At first there were some problems, but normal for my kind of luck. One pair the brown shipping box said Power Configuration US, but the retail package said UK, and the power cord did not fit the speaker. Got a quick no problem replacement. The other pair had something broken inside that was loose. Removing the back I found a 1/4" hard piece of plastic adhesive, that was once attached to the side of a interior wire socket. And the other thing is the woofer measures 4.25" edge to edge of the exposed area. The tweeter is 1". What I like is the volume levels match. I don't mix or produce, and these seem perfectly fine and can handle anything I give it. The Bass Boost switch is very useful and a sub is not needed. The audio spectrum is balanced. It was either these or spend $1000 more for monitors with a reputation.                
I just recently got into home digital recording.  have a Behringer Eurorack UB802, which is a very good mixer, but I also wanted a small mixer with effects to use as a personal PA  I was also looking for one with usb to go into a computer easly . I got this mixer and I'm very impressed with it. The effects work great on it. It has a very smooth sound . I hope to get some great recordings from this . I would highly recommend this to anybody looking for good high quality sound, with a low price.                
I bought this mixer to add karaoke to my list of services. It works great with the Samson r21s that i also got here at zZounds. Also got the Nady duos and the sound a little lower in volume but overall it works for many things like live sound and recording without a problem.                 
Nice size with several input options. Easy setup. Controls are easy to use. One drawback; the included software would not work with my laptop, because it is a 
Vista OS. However, another music software program previously installed, worked
well with the mixer without any trouble setting up.                
Its a wonderful little mixer...but it is not good for recording via usb. when you try and record while the playback is playing it will record the play back on to the input track along with your voice... in other words... IT CANT SPLIT THE IN AND OUT GOING SOUND LIKE AN INTERFACE SHOULD...FREAKING FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!!However, as a mixer the channels are very clean and easy to use... the 2 band eq works just fine and the head phone monitoring has its own knob which is lovely and very useful!                
I bought a Chapman Stick with a MIDI interface but I didn't want to jump into a full rig with a bass amp, guitar amp and synth amp until I felt like I was getting a grip on playing an instrument that's new to me. The Alesis MultiMix 8 USB FX Mixer was a great, inexpensive alternative to a set of amps.It's also nice because I can add a little chorus or reverb and control the gain on the pickups to get a little distortion like a guitar amp. With the mixer I can run both channels of the Stick in along with the synth's stereo output plus I can stream music to play along with from my Mac and mix it all perfectly into a pair of headphones. I think any family will appreciate practicing with headphones. It's been a great little practice rig.                
The price was a little less than other sellers for the same product , the shipping was free , it was processed and shipped very quickly , packaged securely and arrived in perfect condition ! What more can You ask of an online seller ! I can't speak to any form of service repair because I haven't needed to use that part of zZounds !I did call and speak to a Sales Rep to ask a couple questions about proper setup and the Rep walked me thru it perfectly! Very professional ! Thanks zZounds.com                
Great piece of equipment for the price especially. I use it with my Aleses DM 10 Studio Drumset for studio and live action. Does everything I was looking for and more.                
Does not have MIDI IN/OUT.  16 bit not 32 bit, if such things matter to you. If you know what you want- this is great. I would rather mix with hardware than software, so this was for me. You can get a MIDI port with no mixing or fx for about the same price. Just know what you want. The on board reverbs and other fx are very nice, smooth as butter. 2T ins/outs useful, if you do not want to fuss with USB recording. This unit is quite compact, which I like- does not take up my desktop. Useful for all sorts of home studio projects, and just perfect for recording with 2 mics. The first 2 channels have sweepable EQ (you can get several different tones just by twisting knobs) and inserts where you can put stereo insert cables in and send them to your stereo compressor (Alesis 3630). This unit has exactly what i wanted at a great price. The included software Cubase LE 5 seems really great and has tons of bells and whistles. The product registration with Steinberg was tediously long, but instructions were clear and simple.  Tech support is through Alesis. IMPORTANT: You have to open a new Cubase project to find manuals for software under help menu.                
If you look at the specs it doesn't say whether the mixer's in/out are -10 or +4, even on the Alesis website.  I had assumed it would be a +4 system to interface with most pro equipment.  Wrong!  It's a -10 system which means it will not drive any pro powered speaker (unless they have a -10 switch).  It also means that any +4 pres will easily overwhelm the inputs.
Considering that they put a semi-parametric EQ one would think that the intended use is somewhat for the serious amateur or pro needing a small format, portable mixer therefore, it confuses me why they would then use -10 for Ins/Outs - I had to sell mine because it wouldn't drive my speakers and couldn't interface with any of my gear.  
Only after emailing Alesis more than once was I be able to pry the information from the customer service rep.  Very deceiving.  It should be plainly stated in the specs, IMO.                
This mixer is a good one!!!
I  ONLY USED SOME OF IT SO FAR !!!
ITS AN EXCELLENT  MIXER FOR THE PRICE!!!
THANKYOU  zZounds FOR THE GREAT SERVICE.                
I did my research before buying this kit and I got to test it out at guitar center. For the price you can’t beat it mesh heads you can always change the kick towe later down the road, you can add another Tom or cymbal. If your using this kit for practice I would recommend this kit or for the studio you can always download sounds online. But it took me 30 minutes to setup easy to setup. This kit is great for learning new chips playing along tracks or if you just wanna jam. I tweak some of the sounds I didn’t like which is very easy. I love the mesh pads I can practice as late as I want at night without disturbing the peace. Make sure you have good studio monitors or Drum monitor and good 1/4 cable. I love this thing doesn’t take up too much room I would recommend this to anyone who wants to practice or have fun! This kit is with the money I almost spent 900 on a Roland but this work just fine. Don’t hesitate to get this it’s worth the money                
Sound is fine. Speakers are what they are. at lower volumes they sound decent. Biggest improvement to the sound was to use a non powered mixer in front of this with decent pre-amps. Behringer has some decent options from 80-100 that really make this a much more viable option for practice.                
Nice that is has FX even if they aren't great. SD card reader? Don't know what's that's in there at all. but headphone jack and other audio outs come in handy from time to time. Dual XLR-1/4 is nice.                
Plug and play man. Can't really screw it up.                 
Lower grade electronics of course but you get what you pay for. speakers and head seem to be built like bricks. 
The speaker cables that come with it are actually shielded which was a surprise. Other ones i've seen have the chinciest cables.                
Yes.                
Never had to deal with Alesis.                
Would double as an okay monitor set up off a bigger system for small gigs if you needed it to.                
Is it a fancy PA system? Could you actually use this to gig with a full band? Not really
That being said though it works great for what it is. 4 channels, FX aren't anything to get excited but sounds better than a dry signal. Like 80 watts RMS but to use in your basement to practice and only running vocals or a keyboard/acoustic through it? Works great!
I threw a cheap $99 8 channel mixer in front of it using the head as just an amp and it actually works pretty well for practice.                
I bought this PA system the price was right at the time, and thought that it would be fine. However it was not enough power and the fan inside makes a lot of noise. No fault of zZounds but this is just sub-par equipment DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS, spend a little more and get something much better. I have shopped zZounds for almost a year everything else I have bought has been great. It's just this brand...                 
Out of the box these work very well with the dm8.  Setup is simple.  The range between open and close is much better than any other that i have played.  The biggest downside to this is the top pad which is just too loud.  I replaced the top pad with a roland cy12 and now it is quiet and triggers great.  I use the atv ad5 module and it works perfectly.                
I was so excited when I saw these getting ready to come out. I thought for sure that Alesis had put together a unit that would make the other hi-hat look bad. Like so many others, I spent hours tweeking my settings and I'm afraid that It just isn't what I had hoped. I have been salivating over the Zildjian Gen 16s, but they are very expensive. I had really hoped that this cymbal would at least be good enough to stave off the desire to put out that kind of money. now I only want the Zildjians even more. I cant get this new hi-hat to be even as good as the old "Realhat" I am just so sad that it makes me a little sick to my stomach.                
First, I want to say that THIS REVIEW IS IN NO WAY OUT TO HURT ZOUNDS AT ALL...... And I am an owner of an Alesis DMX 10 SET!!! Sooo......The other reviews give a "REAL WORLD" look at a new Alesis product. However, it looks like Alesis did the same thing that they did with the original ADAT, and that was to put it out into the "market place" ( probably because the sales dept. overrode the R & D dept., who knows that the hi-hat is not 100% ready to go ) before ALL THE BUGS were worked out. Not too mention that, if Alesis wants to be competitive they need to make a more realistic set of cymbals, if need be, make them similar to Zildjian's E-Cymbals, which mimics real cymbals anyway, which is what drummers want in the first place, ya know the abundance of sounds that an E-drumming system has/is and that looks like real drums!                   
I bought this to work with my DM8. It does pretty much everything I expected it to and is of similar quality to the rest of my DM8 kit. The instructions for how to set it up were specific to the DM10. So setting it up took a little bit of thinking as to which wires go where. You have to use the wires from the DM8's octopus cable and not the cables it comes with and tells you to use in the instruction. Once it was set up I was very happy with the playability.                
These cymbals did not work at all correctly. Spent several hours trying to get them to work and subsequently accidentally wiped all my custom kits. Very disappointed indeed.                
I had previously used my Yamaha P35 electric keyboard to connect with PreSonus Studio One 3. It had not released the notes like expected. As soon as I hooked this up to my system, which now also has Ableton Live 9 Intro, I had no contradictions with the attack and release that I had expected with my music. The modulation wheel allows me to shape the sound if needed so it's just right.                
I'm new as a drummer to the electronic aspect of percussion. I was looking for a machine that was under the $600-$700 price tag but gave me basic functionality in terms of the types of sounds percussion/basic drum set that sounded good and gave good response from the pads. This unit exceeds that expectation and then some. I expect as I get deeper into the machine I'll discover more uses for it and hopefully it will continue to exceed expectations at $299 for the unit.                
This unit has been exactly what i need in function and form. 3 months old and no issues. Easy to use and a treat to play.                 
The price and feature set looked good but from the moment I unpacked it build quality became a concern. I probably could have been happy until needing to upgrade, but cross talk between pads was so bad (especially the top two) that I couldn't imagine using the Sample Pad Pro in a performance. It might work fine for a simple trigger device.
The power switch is very light weight and doesn't have a solid on/off action.You have to hold it in for an undetermined period before it powers up. No mention of this in the very sparse, but translation rich, manual.
ZZzounds has been outstanding to work with on the return. Replaced it with the DTX Multii12 whhich, even at almost twice the price, looks like it will be a much better value.                 
It was a fun product while it lasted, but at a price point of $299 I expected it would last longer than one year. When I reached out to Alesis, their customer service member told me to just pay someone to get it fixed since it had just passed their one-year-warranty.                
I waited over a year to purchase this unit. I previously owned a Percussion Pad and it was a durable unit with great stock sounds. I expected the same quality with the Sample Pad Pro. What a disappointment. The Software started wigging out almost Immediately and the unit went out completely after about an hour. Same with the second unit. Very Unsatisfied. If you want a good working unit try an Octopad.                
This pad is easy to use and program, but it doesn't turn off and sometimes wont turn on. I am not happy with this.                
I was seriously surprised at : A) how easy this machine is to use and, B.) the quality of the drum sounds. You can tell that these are REAL drum sounds and not computerized beats. I am blown away by how inexpensive this machine is for the quality and ease that it offers. Alesis really is an awesome company. Would definitely recommend.This was my first purchase with zZounds and I look forward to shopping here again. Easy ordering and fast, free shipping.                
I can't believe they still make this. I bought my first one in 1990 at a NAMM expo shortly before it was actually released. Still pretty powerful creation tool. I connect mine via midi to my roland vdrum set and record my own real time patterns, then trigger them with my feet while playing guitar.  The quality does not appear to have changed any from 25 years ago, except for the walwart adapter is slightly smaller. You really need to read the manual and use the foot pedals to open up the true power of this machine.  Cheapest its ever been too.  How many drummers does it take to change a light bulb? None, we have machines for that now.                
Once I became comfortable tooling around with the panning and velocity, I loved it. A great alternative for someone who can't bang the crap out of drums in the house. Not that spectacular for techno-esque sounds.                
No intrinsic accessories, wall wart notwithstanding. The glare on the display can be a hassle. Backlighting would have been great. I probably would have payed thirty dollars more for a backlit display. The MIDI functionality is great but underrated. It does everything and more than my sequencer(on my computer; not built in one) can handle. i.e., my sequencer won't accept MIDI Time messages. boo hoo.                
Entirely plastic. I would not recommend dropping it. As if you were going to try that anyway?? While the jog wheel - well, it's just a volume control - works just fine, it feels off; slightly scratchy or something. 'Can't explain, really.                
Excellent bang(look at that pun go) for buck ratio.                 
'Haven't had to use Alesis' support but the manual documentation is FANTASTIC. Great attention was made to ensure every little aspect of operation is easy to understand. If you don't know what quantization or panning is, you will shortly after opening the manual. They even explain time signatures!!                
Umm, I bought it. It has no "sex appeal", though. It's just an unassuming black box.                
I don't think I'll ever replace it. Yes, there are other, more feature-rich drum machines out there. Those, however, have just added things I can do on my computer's sequencer.                 
This little machine has helped my songwriting tremendously. I just pick a pre-set beat and let that act as a prompt to start strumming and riffing new ideas. I haven't quite mastered creating my own beats yet, but I'm sure that'll come with a little practice and a little patience reading the instructions (don't let this scare you, though -- anyone who knows me knows I'm infamously bad with electronics/technology!). I'm now just waiting for my footswitches (sold separately) so that I can turn it off/on and switch beats with my feet. My only real complaint is not about the machine, but about the zzounds customer service. They mistakenly charged me for and sent me two of these machines when I'd only ordered one. I called up customer service to see how I could return one and get my money back. They gave me instructions, but when I asked if I would be reimbursed for the return shipping, the answer was roughly, "That's not usually our policy since we find that mistakes like this are usually not our fault. But let me check to see what happened." After the representative discovered that it actually WAS THEIR FAULT, he then had the returns department send me a return label, free of charge. So, all is well now, but I did not like the customer service representative implying that I'd done something wrong when I was looking right at my sales invoice saying I'd only bought one!                
The sound is exceptional for a biginner like me. I was delighted on how easy it was to pick up and play right out of the box. Beginner or pro this is a mchince to reckon with. I was never able to express exactly what it was I was trying to come across until I picked this up.                
the sounds are CD quality sounds and great at that. The manual was clear and not difficult to understand. There are two seperate manulas for this product. One was the thurough manual and the "hurry up and play" manual. that was great cuase thats what got me jammin right out of the box!                
The product to my expectaitons was made wiht no flaws. Drum pads and innerface are in perfect working condition and the touch sensitive pasd are still all in perfect working order. I would use this product for many years to come. My motto is..if it ain't broek don't fix it.                
I am a first time buy and new to the recording scene. But as I looked through the online catolog I was amazed at how inexpensive this product was wiht what it had to offer. I thought maybe it was too true to believe til I recieved it. The price of this product was reasonable.                
The balc sleek design of this drumpad was beautiful right out of the box. The compact design was exceptional due to placing it in confined spaces. The rubber of the pads were great. All in all I was amazed at it's look.                
This pad is the main center for my expression. I would not change it for anything. Sure there are other products out there wiht other features and they may be good. But this product does the job and rises beyond my expectations for what it does. I am truly happy wiht this purchase.                
Whole lotta presence! Brings a song to life.                
More than I expected and it makes me feel like I own a real piece. People say the fill feature is unique.                
The quality of the sounds exceeded my expectation. The interface feels sturdy.                
If only all pro-level gear was as reasonably priced as this is.                
Never needed to talk to Alesis. I expect a company that puts as much care in their products as Alesis did with the SR-16 to provide a similar level of care to their customers.                
It looks pro and doesn't waste space                
It sounds great, plays exactly the way I want it to, it doesn't speed up or slow down, it never plays too freekin' loud, it has no substance abuse problems, it's never late for a gig, and I only had to pay it once. The only two things that I don't like about it are, the factory preset rhythms, and like most other drummers it won't help carry band equipment.                  
It would have nice if it came with a foot pedal, but, the price of the unit was so inexpensive that you can afford to buy one. It could also use a light in the screen for live gigs.                
It seems to be well made, I haven't had any problems with it yet.                
It's well worth the money, in fact when I have some extra money I'm going to buy a spare.                
It's great, I'll be buying another one for a spare.                
ok ok - so it's not a back-lit display, display is digital block
but cmon, the thing is almost 20 years old now, no design changes
since, I've bought a Korg module, and now have been using/learning my new NI Maschine
the Alesis swing values, pad response, still the best of any device I've used, tinkered with... seriously!
awesome pad response and sensitivity, even still now on mine which is the 1996 model
sure the sound library is probably easy to consider pretty lame by today's standards - but so what - it's the same library they've had for almost 20 years, and still a lot of the sounds have nice punch, and probably a lot of retro-wantability even now - check out the rap kicks, some of the punch basses, rim snares - all pretty sweet
I'm still going to hook this baby back up into my MIDI setup to use as my primary                
for the price, for durability, for ease, simplicity, sounds, MIDI = awesome
one thing that really sucks is the cut-off/sustain: the note will not sustain
it is designed for drum sustain
it will not sustain a tone for very long, for much longer than maybe                 
big drawback is the lack of visual interface - especially when stringing patterns together - but it's a 15+ year old design
so I just say kudos for keeping the original design and not putting lipstick on a horse                
solid
great pads even after 15 years of use                
$150 falls out of the pockets of a Korg and it doesn't even notice - pick it up and buy one of these too
$150 is sales tax on a DAW - save up another week and get one of these too                
never had to contact tech support
no problems with the device whatsoever aside from my own mess-up losing the original power wall-wart, which I just replaced at Radio Shack... no biggie                
"technological marvel"? ;)
it is nothing compared to today's gear, technologically - but that's because it has the same technology it has had for 15+ years
if one were to have a laptop DAW MIDI setup, this little device should be a must-have for off-board MIDI triggering
you're at the coffee house doing some laptop sequencing, earbuds on= boring
you're at the coffee house doing some laptop sequencing with earbuds, and this easy backpack-stow-er next to your laptop for triggering= sexy                
This device can not be replaced at this point as far as I am concerned - if this unit melts from nuclear blast or explodes from a solar gamma burst (the only things I could imagine causing any harm to this brick) I would definitely replace it, maybe with a couple of them just to have a spare or two after the global socio-economic turmoil resulting from an earth melting gamma burst, or nuclear holocaust...
...and then I would go in search for food and survivors.                
We did a demo with one of these as we were having drummer problems. Most people that heard the demo remarked "how good" the drums sounded..and "What kind of kit did you use"! Most companies that make drum machines seem to forget that SOUND is the most important thing, not bells and whistles...Alesis realized this long ago which is why the machine is still selling today.                
Pretty Versatile for a 12 yr old machine. all that is missing is the 'flam' and 'roll' as found in the Boss machines                
12 yrs and only one problem..a dirty Volume pot, which is my own fault..otherwise..flawless                
You CAN'T do better                
never needed them                
got one                
once again...You CAN'T do better                
Possibly the easiest to use, musician friendly drum machine ever made. A ticket to ride for the songwriter. With (highly recommended) A/B and Fill foot pedals connected, Boss makes them among others, become a one man band. You won't be the first or the last to do so. I use all kinds of software and plug-ins these days, but this was my first and continues to be there for me. There is something magical about just hooking this up anywhere, padding out quick beats and fills, and launching into ideas anywhere anytime when minus a drummer. In terms of solid simple time and timing, it can be better than some drummers (sorry drummer pals, but you know this is no replacement for you good ones.) The samples are good enough/basic per modern standards, and becoming electronic classics as re-sampled here and there. You will probably recognize from rap, hip hop, pop, electronic music both new and old. It's easy to connect MIDI and run more modern/high quality samples from the software/plugin/module of your choice. The SR-16 has quickly and easily propelled me from messing around with a couple parts to completed polished songs that I do live with a band more times that I can count. A flexible, easy to integrate with modern, trusted, reliable, consistent, fun, electronic percussive friend.                
The Samples are diverse and clean. Easily the most 'natural' sounding drum machine I have ever used. Create a song with your patterns, choose a kit then add some outboard compression and the SR-16 sounds like a real drummer.                 
They've covered just about everything, In Depth MIDI functionality, and "human" functions like swing, pad sensitivity etc. allow you to mimic a live drummer like no other machine. The only thing I would add would be 'flam' and 'roll' buttons , like the Boss DR-660 has.                
Can't be beat for the price                
Hands down, the class of the group                
Have not had to contact Alesis for support even once                
Already have it!!!! ;)                
By far the best in its class (Until Behringer decides to make a drum machine, that is!!)                
Great for playing live. A great tip is to use the pitch control when programming a sound. You can make your machine sound "Just like the record".                
The volume pod seems to make noise after a few years of playing but well worth the money.                
It's paid for itself many times over.                
Never needed it                
Can't live without it

Can't live without it                
The sound is great. Just like you had a live drummer with you.                
You need two foot switches. One for on/off and one for fill. Why in the world didn't they put one or two 3/4 time patterns on the preset patterns.                 
It is very easy to get the preset patterns playing. The manual is impossible to follow!! Just try to follow it when you want to record your own 3/4 patterns! Get to page six and you can go no further to set your pattern. It goes back to preset patterns.                
It is made of plastic, so you better handle it with care. There should be a face that lights up so you can see what you are setting it up to when there is no light to shine on the face!!                
It is well worth the price if you can set up your own patterns too.                
I think that the one I bought was defective. I E-Mailed them for information. Two days later I had to E-Mail them again. They answered: Read page 59. I read page 59. I started on page ten of the manual to set up a 3/4 time pattern. Two pages later it went back to preset patterns and I could go no further. I E-Mailed them about four more times and have never gotten an answer from them. I will never buy a Alesis product again!!!                
A practical addition.                
If I lost it I would buy from another company.                
The sounds are dated, but can be tweaked with EQ and compression.
Very easy to learn, and a valuable tool in the studio, when there's no drummer around.                
I bought two pedals, one for start, and stop, and one for fills, only needed for live playing though.                
It's a breeze!                
I've had mine for 12 years, and it works great.                
150 bucks os a steal for what this thing can give you.                
I emailed Alesis for a tutorial CD, and got one free a week later.                
The looks just aren't impressive, but who cares!                
I recorded an entire CD (my first ever) using the SR, and I can't imagine not having one in the studio, if this one broke, I'd buy another.                
Sound is aight... I bought this when it was still new in like 1990 and it was cool, but there are to many things out there now I would not buy this now unless you want oldschool drum samples in your traks
you could make a drum beat that sounds like it belaongs in a Beverly hills cop movie no prob                
Only 233 drums .... nowadays thats bad... quantinizing is very good though                
If you cant figure this out stop EVEN TRYING to make music... this drum machine crazily easy to use beacuse its so plain and simple                
Never broke on me in like 15 yrs. and i still use it from time to time beacause i like the way the Hi-hats sound                
price says it all                
I give it a ten with the benifit of the doubt i never used support and i said if you need them to figure out how to use this drum machine QUIT NOW                
nowadays... save money buy a real powerhouse production station you'll thank me                 
I give this a 9 beacause all these years and i still enjoy qualities of this machine... the price is crazy low and the drum sounds on it are pretty good especially if you consider this was developed in the 80s.... this drum machine is awesome i just think 2006 offers some thing, equipment wise, that this little soldier just cannot compete with, but when i bought it years ago it was $220.00 now it is around $150.00 that says alot about this little sucka                
it good but needs a little more memory                
i like the foot pedals                
It is easy and fun to use                
it has good Quality                
It good but i wish you could have more patterns in a song                
tHE SUPPORT WAS Friendy                
If it was about looks i would have bought a different one. it looked to much like a calculater                
I Like it                
This machine is an absolute standard. Great for beginners to the drum machine programming world. There might be better sounds out there on the variety of products available, but none come close to ease of use, ease of program, and flexibility.                 
Fill A/B and Verse A/B can be used in many combinations, with a footswitch it is more logical than any Boss products. Tune, pan, virtual drum feature is neat.                
I have dropped, soaked, taken it apart to clean, violoated almost every warranty and misuse issue, put it back together...no problems ever.                
At this price, I have two now...no brainer.                
Have not had to...it's mint.                
This thing is great.                
The kits are dead on, has mulitudes of percussion                
I use this for live performance, I love the A/B fills option.  It just like having a live drummer. You can loop and fill as long as you want.                
I currently use this unit live and for recording.  I has been a faithfull unit for the past 3 years.                
I paid a $180 bucks for my unit at guitar center, two years later they are selling them for $140.  I've seen them (used) on ebay for as low as $45.  They are a great unit, but I wish they would have put more factory preprogrammed patches in it and saved me a lot of programming.                
Havent need this one.                
Sounds great, easy to use. So many preprogrammed beats that I have never had to program my own so I can't speak to the ease of that. For the price it can't be beat. It has some very tastey beats. Love it!!!!                
The SR 18 by Alesis is great. I use it for a 1 man jazz organ trio gig. The sounds are realistic across the board and the unit is a breeze to use.                 
Some drum sounds are excellent, and sound similar to real drums, if that is what you wish to have. I have good high frequency hearing, and the 44.1K sample rate is not good enough to reproduce cymbal sounds accurately. It is CD quality, if that is good enough for you. Some of the drum sounds are better that the Zoom RT-223, but the Zoom has more control over the effects. The SR18 only offers a large range of preset effects; you cannot modify them in any way.
The SR18 probably has better drum presets, and they all have fills and A/B parts, but the SR18 song editing has a major flaw if you wish to use the bass track. I explain this in the features section.                
The SR18 software has major flaws.
When you assembly a Song from Patterns, you create a series of "steps" with each step playing one Pattern. You are not given an opportunity to specify either the number of bars for the step (it must be the length of the Pattern) or the bass root, or transposition, of the step.
This means your Patterns must already be transposed to exactly the right key, and they have to be exactly the right length. I wished to create a blues song quickly. Some blues patterns are great, but I could not assemble them into a song without first copying them into an empty user pattern and modifying the bass notes. In some cases I needed to change the length of the pattern, to shorten it. This is not explained in the manual but it is possible by setting the "recording settings" pattern length, and saving the pattern again. Once you shorten the pattern, you lose your fills... they are at the end, because a fill pattern is the same length as an A/B pattern.
The Zoom RT-223 does not have these problems. With the Zoom, you can specify the number of bars played for each step in a Song, as well as the bass key.                
It is easy to use if you mute the bass and use only the drums. It is good for live use, with the foot-switch controls.
For creating songs with bass tracks, it is hard to use, because of the problems specified in the features section. Also, step editing built-in patterns can be difficult. First you copy it to an empty user space. Then, you select a quantization and swing amount that matches the smallest time interval used in the pattern. How do you figure out the swing amount? You have to guess. Why is this important? When you go to the next "step" in the pattern, using step editing, it takes you forward in time by the quantization interval and the swing. If there is no event at that point in time, you cannot edit anything. If you skipped over an event, you cannot edit it.
Many built-in patterns do not use quantization, so the only practical way to edit them is to set the quantization to 96 parts per quarter note, and tediously step 96 times for each quarter note. This is crazy and indicates a poor software design.
The Zoom RT-223 does not suffer this problem. Step editing allows you to jump directly to the next event as it should.
Another problem with the SR-18 is you have to hit the pads with a small hammer to get the highest velocity setting. You really get only a few practical velocity variations if you use your fingers. It is as if the pads were for drumsticks.                
Excellent quality, except the jacks are plastic, not metal. It is made in Taiwan, not communist China. The only mechanical flaw is the wrong pads -- they seem to be for drumsticks, not fingers.                 
Excellent value for the sounds and patterns. Poor value for the software for editing songs, and for step editing patterns.                
I did not use support.                
Not very happy with the song editor and pattern step editor. I like the sounds however.                
The sounds are excellent quality.  The sound from the out's is powerful and clear, some cheesy drums included but its just a matter of taste i guess.  The bass feature is a bonus so im not gonna be too judgemental on that one but it gives you 3 ocataves(i think)of basses, some are pretty cool, some are blah.                
great sequencing, menus are easy once you read the book, comes with an ac adapter..  some people might take issue with the outs, all are 1/4 inchers and midi, but there's headphones, aux, left out right out etc, so there are a bunch.                
even with the limited LCD the machine is easy to use.  The documentation is very clearly written.  The limited display and interface only becomes an issue when step editing certain events in high step patterns.. no big deal, takes a little patience. Buttons/wheel feel great.                
the build of this thing is easily described: Solid.  Solid plastic, sturdy pads, wheel feels durable, no flex.  This thing doesnt feel at all hollow, it feels like thick plastic with a solid metal core.                
I think this is well worth the price most are selling it for, if it was msrp.. well still worth it, but harder to pull the trigger on it.                
Dont know anything about the support.                
this thing looks, sounds and feels great.                
I cant speak for others but this machine does what i want it to do and it does it very well, it's predecessor was widely sold/used from 1989 till today, this one might just do the same, alesis-sr20 in 2037?                
Sound quality is great. Although way too many cowbells and goofy snares in the programmed presets rendering most unusable without editing them. Programming really SUCKS. If it didn't sound this good, I would have returned it.                
Building your own patterns is a Must. Could BE A MUCH EASIER PROCESS. Programmed presets are not very compatible with  Rock/Metal compositions. Out of all the different patterns, not many are usable. Way too many obscure beats and the ones that are supposedly for Rock are either too generic or accented at the wrong beat. More relevant beats on my Digitech pedal than this drum machine. I've gotten many , many headaches from the programming process.                
I have wanted to punch a programmer in the face 101 times in the last 2 months. They could not have made this machine more user-unfriendly. I build computers , use various editing software, and program all my pedals to my taste so I do have some experience. Every single modification you make seems to be forgotten as soon as you try to navigate the clunky menu to save and edit and press more buttons than necessary to try and complete even the most simple task. A total IDIOT set this up throwing the Rock patterns all over the Menu in random spots instead of grouping the genres where I have to keep the pattern list handy because the fools had to throw patterns around the menu randomly for no apparent reason except to piss you off. Learning Curve? I would have thrown it out the window if I didn't NEED drums. Not a playable instrument with the tiny pads but they work fine for pattern construction.                
Seems very well built. Had good luck with Alesis in the past so I trust them.                
I should get half my money back with as many headaches as I've gotten programming and creating beats.                
Wish they had programmers that were musicians so they could figure out musicians don't want to waste so much time creating their own patterns. Photoshop and sign making software are easier to use than this device, and that's pathetic.                
I'll give it a 5 since I have it and still want it to produce drums for my songs. It sounds good, just didn't want programming a machine to take up my day I could have spent playing guitar.                
As soon as I find another product that sounds this good but is user-friendly to program I will buy it immediately. I am already looking but can't send back because I need it and that would put me too far behind.
I would buy something else if it was stolen.                
This drum machine is everything they claim it to be as far as sound quality, effects, available processes. The problem is, unless you are a studio tech. and can spend hours and hours working out a particular pieces, it is probably not your cup of tea. If you looking for something quick and easy to lay out a simple drum and bass line look somewhere else. For example the key of the bass line can be changed to play in the key of your choice, however, you must first figure out what key the preset bass line is in. To do this you need to use a second sound source such as a guitar or piano that you know the key of, listen by ear to both until you match the key of the bass line. Now you can change that key up or down to where you would like. With such a high tech device could it not have been much simpler to just show the key of the bass line on the display? For the advanced user this machine should not be disappointing in the least, but for the basic end user just wanting to add a quick bass and drum beat, it is much to complicated and not at all user friendly.                
1. MIDI synch does not work very well with Boss DR-5 midi controller
2. Patterns are erased when turning on and off (straight out of the box new)
3. Tom-Toms are not in order from high to low when scrolling through sounds
4. You have to press play and record at the same time to program patterns
5. Too many odd sounds that are not drums at all or even worth using
6. Too many unnecessary articulation set ups
7. Cymbals sound like a kids toy drum set
8. Pads and velocity does not change even when set to LOUD
9. Bass tones are not realistic
10.. SR -16 is much more straight forward                
The Alesis drum machine is great sounding and very easy to use, but it does fall a little short. The machine offers a large data base of sounds and rhythmms but the only one it doesnt offer is actually the one reason I bought a drum machine in the first place. The Cumbia rhtyhm is not installed in the machine, you can have someone install it for you or prgram it but it comes with a large fee.                
The sound is very good, a big improvement from my old drum machine. I'm not quite sure what to do with the bass sounds, however. Why couldn't they release a fake book chord chart of all the different sounds, so you know what the bass is playing? They certainly know... they programmed it! Why do I have to go through and write down what the key and chord progressions are? How time consuming and redundant!                 
It should come standard with pedal switches. Very few live performers wouldn't want them.                
This is (so far) a  BIG BIG disappointment. I waited 20 years to update my old Roland Compu0Rhythm CR-8000 (the one they used on Revenge of the Nerds!) and I have to tell you, that thing was SOO much easier to use performing live and off the cuff. 
1. The rotary dial should be a knob not a rotary dial. the fingers are good at twisting a knob, not so good at spinning in a circle without finger coming out of the little indentation in the knob.
2. You should NOT have to hold down the tempo button while spinning the dial to change tempo playing live. Either it takes two hands (how you gonna keep playing?) or you run a GREAT risk of having your thumb slip off the tempo button while spinning the dial, which means you just changed rhythm and tempo DRAMATICALLY right in the middle of a song, for Pete's sake. What were they thinking?
3. I know small is "cool" but for live playing all the buttons should be twice as big, even if that means making the total size bigger. With all the stuff going on/keyboards around me while I'm playing, the Alesis has to be 3 ft  away, and it is hard to hit the tiny buttons accurately, much less read the writing quickly and in a dark night club. Obviously, these guys are techno geeks, not real musicians who play live in the real world. 4. They should allow you to change preset rhythms without automatically jumping to a different tempo. They way they have it, I have to conform my pieces to the rigidity of the machine, rather than the machine conforming to the way I want to play a piece. I want a preset rhythm, then I can quickly with one hand twist a dial to the tempo I want. My CompuRhythm 8000 was MUCH better at this. If anyone knows a rhytym unit that will do what I want, please send me a Youtube message to channel "MayadaJeffery". thanks.                
I'm sure the quality is fine. I haven't had it out much yet, as I'm still figuring out if I'm even gonna be able to use it in a live, spontaeous gig situation.                
It certainly is inexpensive for the quality and quantity of sounds you get.                
unknown                
For a live performing, stage/club musician without a preconceived set list, it's a disaster.                
Out of the box and just jaming it has an incredible sound very close to a real drummer. However, I have to mute the bass and play bass with my left hand, chords (Hammond XK3) with my right and I sound like a 3 peace rocknroll group. Add a guitar player and it does sound like a real band. The fills are incredible.With that said, the bass lines that are pre-programmed are incredible, but they do not change in basic progressions. For example a basic blues or rock progression goes somethng like this 1-4-1-4-5 or a 1-6-4-5 (sears robuck changes) In any event, the bass player feature although incredible you are simply stuck with a 1 and 4. You can't complete the progression unless you mute out the bass. They have a fill feature A and B. They just needed to add C and change it if you want a 1-6-4-5 progression. Those are basic to rock and roll and could have been easily incorporated into the programming. I suspect a musician did not program this machine or he would have understood basic patterns.The machine can be used for a live proformance as long as the bass feature is muted and you have a real bass player or play left hand bass on keyboard. Those bass lines are not as good as the proprogrammed ones.As far as programming it to a "song" I have no idea what the hell they are talking about. Its written in techie language and not easy to do any of these functions.It would be nice to have a feature to stop abruptly (which you can with a foot switch) then press another foot switch for a different tempo and back to the original tempo. Its not happening with this machine.Its truly not user friendly but what is there sounds incredible for blues and rock. I would like to locate a drum machine that follows basic changes as described above.                
I have spent countless hours trying to figure out how to program just one song and I am still not there. The manual is a total waste. The bass plays one key I find no way to change it. Then how do you blend it with the drums and record and save it? The SR18 would be great if it worked.                
the sound is great. but try to put it to music lol good luck                
i dont know                
I may be stun. But i dont think so. good luck                
it is not made cheap                
i lost my shirt on this unit                
never tried to reach them                
this unit is not what i am looking for at all . I just wanted something that would keep a beat for me . while i played an old countrty western tune                
This review is after having my kit for a little over a week. This is my third alesis kit (DM8, DM10X, and now Alesis Strike). I'm very limited for space atm so I opted for the smaller package. The smaller Strike set is identical to the larger "Pro" set minus 2 cymbals and a tom - the brain/rack/etc seem to be identical. The Rack: Far superior to the (honestly) junk rack that came with my DM10X. The fittings are pretty cheap but they have been quite sturdy so far. It's not to the level of stability of a good Gibraltar rack with cast fittings but I am pretty hard on drums and have not had a single fitting/rack arm move.Drum Triggers: Insanely sensitive, so much that my snare will shotgun trigger on it's own if you turn the trigger threshold all the way down. There is a small dial on the side of each drum allowing you to adjust the sensitivity - I don't know why you would need these, setting the drum-dial to 50% I still had to adjust the module sensitivity for that trigger down to 10-15%. I will note that sensitivity was a HUGE issue on the older DM10X systems - I'm glad they resolved this.Cymbal Triggers: It's nice to see a two cymbal stack for the high-hats. Took some fiddling to get the pedal threshold where I wanted them but I'm more comfortable now. They do feel unnaturally thick though. Transitioning across edge/bow/bell on the ride feels fantastic - the ride cymbal is huge and is the most authentic sound/feel of all the cymbals. The crash cymbal is 2-zone with choke, and despite some tinkering, I still get the occasional bow triggering when I really wanted an edge trigger. Hats are two-zone too, in theory I thought I would love this but again it's been more of an issue than a benefit.Sound Module [Genera]l: First off - what speakers/headphones you use matters ALOT. I've only used my AT M50x so far, which are notably sensitive headphones, and noticed the headphone output is kinda noisy at full volume. Like the DM10 before, this module features volume sliders but thankfully the A/B bank system is gone (who's idea was that anyway??) and now every instrument has it's own slider. However, I have noticed that sometimes the internal volumes reset to some default value and I have to "jiggle" the slider to get it to re-register where the slider is located. The screen is full-color but it's worth noting the user interface design is pretty unsaturated and thus doesn't take full advantage of that. The screen is, however, very easy to ready. Sound Module [Sounds]: This is pretty important and I was honestly concerned based on what I heard of Texas Tim Root from NAMM. I'm not sure if they were using an older sound engine or if it's just the lack of dynamics in Tim's playing but I was much happier with the engine once I got to play it. Interestingly enough, some of the snares sound really good when playing accented rolls (something the DM10 was terrible at) and some just shotgun away - either way there are definitely some great sounding snares! I've noticed Alesis likes heavy and full-bottomed tom tones and I'm happy to oblidge - toms sound great and dynamic. All triggers have an A and B layer sound set (each with it's own volume/tone adjustment) which allows pretty impressive customization. The most pleasant surprise was the instrument customization interface and sound file-system. It's fantastic and beats the snot out of anything I have ever seen. Sounds engine is still not recording level but who records straight from a e-drum brain anyway?Sound Module [Accessories]: This Strike and Strike Pro use the same sound module - and for the Strike Pro all inputs are filled by the included triggers/pads. What is more interesting is the 8x 1/4" channel outputs (in addition to the LR mains outputs). I'm not sure the intended use of these outputs - midi recording is more suitable for studio work. The real application I could see is live applications so the FOH engineer has more mix-control, however, my experience with even larger clubs is they have limited 1/4" snakes. If the outputs were buffered XLRs - now that would make some engineers happy! Hooking the module up to my PC using the built-in USB was insanely easy and I was trigger EZDrummer in no time!Final Thoughts: Alesis has really stepped up the game this generation and fixed a great deal of the previous issues with the DM10. It's honestly not fare to compare the two. The rubbers across the board are better, the rim silencers on the DM10 pads barely lasted me a month.                
This seems to be a quality kit. I used to have some top of the line Roland V-Drums (circa 2008) and compared to those this Alesis kit seems to trigger much more reliably and predictably. Fantastic library of sounds available. Now I wish I had gotten the Pro kit, or I wish there was an expansion kit that would take this up to the Pro kit (one more pad, 2 more crash cymbals).                
Physically, the Strike kit is solid.  The box weighed a ton and each item appears well-built.  Fully set up, it definitely doesn't resemble many e-kits that look like toys.  The feel of the heads is also quite nice. Slightly more bouncy than real heads, but still nice.  
The main problems with this kit are two-fold.  First, the high-hat.  Getting consistent sound from it is difficult.  And forget about getting any sizzle.  It's a one-trick pony.  In addition, the "real" kit sounds from the module just don't sound real, notwithstanding the hundred plus sound options.  Updating to the latest firmware hasn't solved either problem.  I've also had difficulty getting the module to work with iOS GarageBand.  Alesis support says it "should" work, but there's significant latency and not all the instruments will trigger.  I purchased this kit specially for home recording, but thus far it hasn't been able to meet that basic requirement. 
Unfortunately, these short-comings leave me with an expensive paperweight.                  
The kick drum trigger completely cut out after one month, the crash trigger is at 65% reliability and the rubber material on the crash is getting warped and has air pockets on top of it. I dont know if I got a bad make and model of the kit but for 1700$ and their horrible warranty program, it's not worth the risk.                
So if you have done any research on this kit you'll have read about woes with the hihat. So first thing is update the module to v1.4, this has taken care of any of the issues I read about on mine. Get ready to give up a fair chunk of floor space. It is just like having a full acoustic kit set up. It took about an hour or so to set it all up ( not my first electronic kit ). Really simple to do and your ready to go....... Well almost. You will need a kick pedal, stool and hihat stand.So far this kit is outstanding, plenty of good (and some barely passable) kits on board the module. Or if your like me USB connection to my Mac and triggering EZ Drummer 2 ( choose DM10 for your default input kit).I have owned the TD25 and in my opinion for the money the Strike Pro can't be beat.                
Can’t believe the bass out of this sub. So clean and loud.                
Super sweet action.                
fantastic big sound, excellent plugged in or unplugged.                
super easy to sound great! Infinitely playable.                
Beautiful construction, workmanship.                
This is a bargain.                
no problems whatsoever.                
Everything about it is Wow!!                
I'm not a bass player, I'm a 6 string electric and acoustic player. I bought one of these for someone else, and it was totally incredible. It had faster action than some 6 string electrics, and had incredibly awesome tone, unplugged and plugged. I loved playing it, I have never been a fan of playing bass, but will undoubtedly get another one of these someday, for myself...                
I ordered this bass online because it was really the only option a bass player has for an acoustic or most electrics sadly. I received the first one the next day after I ordered it because I payed for overnight shipping. The bass arrived with a crack behind the bridge. Needless to say I was very disappointed. I immediately contacted Zzounds. They furnished the shipping label and promised me a replacement would ship out that day overnight to me. This was important because I needed the bass for an acoustic set we were doing that Sunday. The guitar did not ship that day. It shipped the next day and did not arrive till that Monday. I was disappointed. When the replacement did arrive it also had a crack behind the bridge but this crack was in the seam where they joined the two top pieces. I was livid, but this is where Zzounds showed how great a company they are. They reimbursed my Luthiers cost to repair it and discounted the bass. They are a great company and truly aren't happy until you are. I will continue to buy from Zzounds in the future. I would recommend all bass players buy their acoustic basses from Zzounds. The guitar will always need a setup from your local guys but you get such a better deal with Zzounds it's still a good deal. In summary a bass player will nearly always have to buy an acoustic version online because most all guitar stores cater to guitarists. It's just a fact, but bassists can buy from Zzounds with 100% peace of mind because they have your back and will always go the extra mile with customer service. So go ahead buy it. There's no excuse.                
I went to the music store, lined up all three acoustic/ electric basses and played each in a row a Fender(599.00), an Alvarez(459.00), a a Boulder Creek(899.00). Unplugged the Fender was loud, good action but buzzed just a bit more than I liked, very fixable. The Alvarez Loud, Good action, very playable, the Boulder Creek Good action, smooth, you need a hearing aide to hear it! I could have bought any of the three. The Alvarez price tag was the smallest. I went home with the Alvarez! I never plugged the Boulder in it could have been one mean mother plugged in but, I need strictly unplugged sorry BC!. I can't give ANY manufacturers support rating.I just bought this. I have no CLUE if they are good bad or indifferent.                
I have no idea why these aren't more expensive. Thunderous devil bass notes without getting muddy, easy to play given the size of the strings. This guitar is more responsive than my Gibsons and Martins, meaning that you can play whisper quiet, or pick harder and get LOUD with sustain that rings on and on. I do a solo act, and a baritone makes all the difference, nice and full sound. Look it up on YouTube, several demo vids there. I'll probably buy another just to keep open-tuned for slide work. 
I bought the Alvarez JC1 Case for it.  Good case, fits it perfectly, though I've heard some complain that the controls on the acoustic/electric version make it too tight of a fit. Could be. It's a snug fit (which I consider a plus), but might be too snug for the electric.    
Personally, I got the acoustic version because I much prefer the sound of an acoustic through a mic.                 
I really liked this guitar out of the box. The sound really rings out; the tone is great. I liked it so much that I looked into a higher end baritone, just to see what was out there, but found that this sounded better - straight up better - than one in the 2 thousand dollar range. That settled it for me.The fingering at both ends is a little tight, so I've made some small adjustments, but the sound really can't be touched, and now it plays like a dream. If you're interested, go find one to play, you'll fall in love.                
it took about 2 days for me to get used to this thing but once I got the beast under control it turned into a beautiful sounding and playing guitar.my only beef is the strings it came with. d'darrio coated are great if you never want that new string sound.. but i like the articulation of new phosphor bronze strings.Baritone string sets are limited so i'm searching for the right ones. ordered some La Bellas so we'll see. its not for everyone for sure.                
I decided on the ABT60E after looking at every Baritone acoustic I could find. It seemed to have all the features I wanted and the price was very reasonable. I was concerned that the specs on the zZounds website were not the same as the Alvarez website, which showed some up-dated features on this model that I wanted. (LR Baggs Pickup, 1 3/4" nut). I placed the order and was approved for the "pay as you play" financing, which really helps ease the burden of buying a new instrument. The guitar arrived in two days! Everything on the guitar was perfect out of the box! I was relieved see it did have all of the up-dated features as shown on Alvarez's website. The build quality on the guitar is outstanding for a guitar in this price range! The gloss finish on the solid Sitka top is flawless, the satin finish on the B/S is a smooth as can be. The bound neck and fret work are super-smooth, and set-up is perfect, nice and low with no fret out's or buzz. Neck angle is perfect, and the neck is straight. Intonation is spot-on! As for tone, it is very full and rich with lot's of low-end and mids. The size of the guitar is a bit daunting at first, and the 27.5" scale neck along with 16-70 baritone strings take some getting used to for sure! 
The ONLY complaint I have with this guitar is that I hear some buzzing inside the guitar on some of the low note overtones. I can't quite place where they are coming from, but I suspect the electronics. This is annoying but doesn't affect the amplified sound at all, just when played acoustically. I'll have to take it to my luthier to fix if I can't solve it myself. zZounds did a great job on this order! This is my second purchase from zZounds, and I am sure there will be more. I also ordered the Gator Jumbo Hardshell case zZounds recommended and had it shipped in it. ( I never ship an acoustic guitar without being in a hard case). The Gator case is very nice, good, tight fit and seems well made. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this ABT60E to anyone looking to add a little "depth" to their guitar bench for not a lot of money. I really had a hard time putting it down, it's a lot of fun to play!  This guitar is a great value! Thanks zZounds!                
Overall very happy with and pleasantly surprised by the fit and finish, tone, and playability of this instrument for this price point. I own many instruments including Martin JC40 and 000 guitars, a Taylor 514, several Tacomas, etc. and feel good about giving this instrument a positive review.                
Bought the ABT60E as "blemished", so at $329 it was a steal; paid my luthier $35 to reattach a loose wire in the pickup and it was fine.  Guitar plays great acoustically (I haven't plugged it in yet) and the workmanship and finish are very good for this price point.  I will put regular lights on to use it as a camp guitar and save my good one from the elements.                
i bought this because of the low price and the quality of the parts. i wanted a sitka top, mahogany back, machine cast pins, ebony fret board, bone nut, d'addarrio strings et al. all the parts were pretty high quality so i took a chance on the workmanship. it is a very nice guitar..the best one i have ever owned in fact. it sounded not so good when i first got it but that was because it was new and just breaking in and also because i was way out of practice. my other favorite guitar before i lost it was a $150 epiphone i bought back in the 70's.. the alvarez ad30 is the cheapest guitar alvarez makes i believe and you will be hard pressed to find a bottom of the line guitar that plays better.                
Really nice sound and feel to this acoustic guitar. Has a 1.75" nut with and nice string spacing. I tried quite a few acoustic guitars in this price range and to me this one is the best of the bunch. When it arrived, it definitely needed a set-up and fresh strings, so after I had that done, I am extremely satisfied and feel like this a guitar I will use for many years!                
I have read a lot of other reviews for this guitar and everyone was talking about how great it is for the price. To me it's just average and sounds like an inexpensive guitar. Sure it's loud, but the sound isn't great. It has almost a dullness to it that is hard to explain, not dynamic at all. The action out of the box was terrible and I felt like I had to press down extra hard on chords to get them to sound right. I don't play acoustic much and I bought this for strumming along and singing songs nothing special. I guess I am just used to the luxury of my PRS. If this is all you can afford it is ok and you will have a decent experience. I suggest saving a little more and getting something better. zZounds is great though. I have bought several guitars and an amp from them and the experience is always great.                
This guitar plays unbelievably well for the $300 price tag. Years ago I had a much more expensive, higher end Alvarez that I absolutely loved and I can barely tell a difference between the two. Lets not leave out the electronics, the built in chromatic tuner is great and not your typical cheap built in tuner with 3 little lightbulbs on it. It's very accurate and has a very bright and visible screen. The solid top provides a very rich tone and the action is great straight out of the box. Any beginner, intermediate, expert, hobby, and professional guitar player will appreciate this guitars bang for its buck. 10/10 would recommend to anybody in need of an acoustic guitar but does not have $800+ to fork over for one right now.                
Sounds bright and full. I recorded direct with the onboard electronics and with a microphone                
I was pleased to see the built in tuner. It made it easy to tune right up!                
I get great sounds out of mine by both strumming and finger picking ! The volume is loud enough to fingerpick softly and still get volume                
This guitar is very beautiful and well made. The finish looks like it will last the life of the instrument                
Value is amazing. I would expect this instrument to be in the $600-$800 price range from it's sound and playability.                 
This is an awesome addition to my home studio. Records beautifully with mic or onboard electronics                
Upon receiving my guitar I noticed the packaging was excellent and easy to open. The guitar arrived in perfect condition. I immediately used the built in tuner to tune it up and start playing. Plays like a dream and sounds awesome. Just the quality I expected from Alvarez. Always wanted one and now that I have one I am not disappointed. Thank zZounds.com!                
Very nice looking guitar. Not to shiny which is nice. Stays in tune better than my Martin. Now with that said., the set up was horrible. Nut to high in my opinion. Strings way to high for my preference. And wires were just hanging there in the middle of the sound hole. I expected better than that from Alvarez. But with all that fixed and a string change to Martin retro. It really sings.                
Great Sound on this guitar and very easy to play                
For the price, sound is great plugged & unplugged. Electronics great for this price range.                
Vibration of spruce top is great. I do feel nut could be lower. and there's a slight intonation problem little E & B strings                
Pretty good                
Looks well made. Set up, not as good as I expected from Alvarez                
Yes                
Yes                
Brand, Solid Top, Price                
Very good for $300 solid top                
Holy cow. This is a nice fiddle. I have been playing guitar for 15 year or more, I don't remember. I wanted an acoustic. I have played several Alvarez models over the years and I have always been a fan. I can say this is the absolute best Alvarez model I have EVER played (I have never played a Yairi or master series yet though). This guitar is smooth, plays great out of the box, and the fit and finished is excellent. 
If you are looking for an inexpensive, but incredibly awesome guitar, this if for you. The pictures look kind of generic, and bland, but in person the guitar looks awesome. It has a matte finish all over, but with a gloss top, which was a pleasant surprise. The neck is smooth as butter and has a slight V profile. If you are V neck fan you will dig it. I love the V neck. Was skeptical of the hardware since it is no name, but the tuners hold steady and are smooth.
TL;DR: Buy this guitar, it is great.                
I bought this AD-60 in April 2012, I Found This Comfortable Dreadnaught to be an excellent Little Instrument.. It has a Clear Bright Ring to The Sound Board and The Unmistakeable Sound of an Alavrez.. For the Money You Have a nice Gig worthy Box...                
This Alvarez AD60 is not as nice as last one they made. Real Heavy guitar. Not as playable with a flatter radius.                
Beautiful sounding and easy playing dreadnought. I wanted something simple or a little understated because for me, it's all about the tone and Alvarez always delivers on craftsmanship. This one was set-up perfectly right out of the box.This was my first instrument purchase from zZounds and I'm so glad I chose these guys. My order was processed quick, shipped the same day and I received it a day later. That's how you develop relationships with customers!Thanks zZounds...I gotta get back to playin! Dan                
This guitar is very well made with great quality material. The tone is beautiful and playability is easy. I looked months online trying to decide what guitar I wanted and I chose the Alvarez, due to the fact, you get better quality and constructed guitar for the money. I am extremely happy with my purchase and like the fact Zzounds has a "Play as you Pay" which helps when on a tight budget.                  
This was one of the best things I've come across on the internet. Pay as you play was a great way to get the guitar of my dreams and not have to drop all the money at once. The website is easy to use and I'm thrilled with the Alvarez.                 
I read another review of this guitar and thought that they couldn't be talking about the same model. As far as the fret ends go, this guitar is the smoothest of all my guitars...including electrics. I didn't care for the sound and playability at first. I changed the strings out to 80/20 bronze 11's and man, what a difference! Now I love the way it souds and plays. Outperforms my son's Taylor model of the same size and woods. I'm so glad I took a chance on this guitar!                
The sound quality is good for a new acoustic guitar. A little age will tell what the long story will be.                
The woods used seem to work well with each other but with an acoustic guitar only time will tell.                
This baby is a fighter. She fights me for every note I try to get out of her. I'm hoping some adjustments by my luthier will end our fighting.                
The die cast tuners will have to be replaced ASAP. Only time will tell on the rest of the construction.                
With the non finishing of the fret ends, and poorly cut nut the guitar is not worth the selling price.                
I did ask the company what size the truss rod is since they did not include a truss rod wrench. They were prompt with their reply.                
The only thing that made me go WoW with this guitar was how poorly the fret ends were neglected and cut my hand and shredded my cleaning cloth.                
Purchased this guitar in the end of 2017 from zZounds. Let me say zZounds is the best! This is my second purchase from them and there will be more purchases soon! Now about this guitar. To qualify, my main guitar since 1973 has been a 1962 Gibson Hummingbird. I have owned and sold others such as Fender, Yamaha, Ovation, Martin, Mitchell. Let me start off with the number one no no on any guitar. The fret ends on both sides of the neck have cut my hand and shredded cleaning cloths from being so sharp. The nut was left with bad cuts for the B and E string resulting in lots of snapping and cracking and hard to get the right tune because of it. The tuners, well, they are die cast so I didn't expect them to be much and they aren't. The finish is acceptable. The action is too high for my liking and this guitar likes to put up a fight when you play it. I strongly considered returning it to zZounds but there is something hidden here that is making me keep this guitar. Yes it will cost me more to take it to my Luthier to fix all that is wrong to make this guitar playable, and new tuners will have to be installed, but for some reason the sound has a likeability to it that I am enjoying. It has a V shaped neck that does not fit my hand well and causes me pain which I may end up having sanded down. The neck sides themselves are a bit too squared off and hurt when trying to use a thumb to wrap around for bass notes which I do often. The Grand Auditorium size is nice and I like it since all my other acoustics are dreadnoughts. Every new guitar is like a new girlfriend. Time, and give and take, and compromise, may lead to a very long wonderful relationship. I'm hoping that Alva and I will continue our relationship and this won't end up a costly divorce for me.                
Amazing! Right out of the box ! Perfectly set up...great set of D'Addarrio strings... L.R. Baggs system sound sweet...the Walnut really gives this it's own special sound... somewhere in-between Mahogany and Rosewood...nice mellower tone...back off , she's mine !! Get your own !! Cheers Alvarez , thank you for a fine instrument !!                
I purchased this Avarez model with walnut back and sides from zZounds and was surprised by how fast they got it here. Unfortunately, the one I received had a "sunken top" due to low humidity during shipping and storage. This left a hump where the neck joined the body and no amount of truss rod adjustment could remove the fret buzz that was on every string past the 7th fret. The only solution to keep it would have been to raise the action...but who wants to do that? So i sent it back. I got a replacement with no issues and found this to be a great guitar with a different tone than any other acoustic I've played. It has a wide body depth at the lower bout and this gives the guitar lots of bass response. Treble response is good as well and from a tone description, it's fairly close to what you would get with a solid koa top with lots of mid range. Finger picking sounds good from this guitar as does flat picking, but you can't drive this quite as hard as a spruce top guitar. that said, it has good volume projection either way. The neck feels good, fret dressing is good and the electronics are good as well. I like the GA size too.She's a keeper and a looker too. I can recommend this guitar. Finding a case might be tough due to the wide depth but I'm sure there's one out there.                
There is a reason that I waited so long to review this guitar.  I am notorious for purchasing guitars, and then over the course of a few weeks, I find find something about the instrument that drives me insane, and I either sell it, or trade it off.  The Alvarez AP66 broke the trend.  It is without a doubt, the best acoustic steel string I have ever played.  Now, before you purists start rolling your eyes, let me explain.  I have been playing the guitar for thirty-plus years.  I have played electric, acoustic, and classical.  I love all styles of music, and at one time or another, have focused on one particular style for months or even years.  I switch it up to keep it fresh, I suppose.  But my love for the guitar has never waned.  I have played cheap instruments that blew me way, and I have played boutique instruments that were laughable. I am a firm believer that the it's the player, and not the instrument that matters.  With that said, let me get down to the specifics for those of you that are considering purchasing this guitar.  
The tone of this guitar is astounding.  It is warm and full, and it does not lean toward either the bass or the treble.  It plants itself squarely in the middle, and allows you to determine the timbre of the sound.  It responds equally well to your fingers and to your pick.
The volume, like the tone, is up to you.  If you dig in, it will rattle the fillings out of your mouth.  If you play gently, the sweetness of the sound will give you cavities.
The craftsmanship is too good for this price point. I cannot find any flaws in the binding, no excessive glue inside the body, and the finish is truly gorgeous. 
The setup from the factory, at least on the one I received is spot on.  The action is low, but not too low.  It plays like a dream.  I made the mistake of putting a set of light silk and steels on it, and I got some fret buzz.  Parlor guitars have a shorter scale, and they tend to respond better with heavier strings.  I guess this is why Strat players can go lighter, and Les Paul players can go heavier.
Alas, no guitar is totally perfect.  The ONLY issue I have with this guitar is the tuners.  They are not on par with rest of the instrument.  They bass side has too much play, and the treble side is sticky.  I will be replacing the factory tuners with Grover Stat-Tites very soon.
I still highly recommend this guitar.  It has the punch of a dreadnaught, but the articulation of an OM.  I have always thought that 12 frets to the body improved the sound of any guitar, but that's just me. So, for under $400, this is without a doubt the best guitar on the market, and it can hold its own against gutars costing five times as much,  Alvarez hit a home run with this one.  If they upgraded the tuners, it would be a grand slam.
I don't usually write reviews, but this guitar wowed me.  I love the look of the shadowburst, the feel of the neck, and the sound of this little gem.  I have owned several alvarez guitars over the years, and love them, so does my little brother who usually inherits mine.  I bought this guitar for bottleneck slide, and the setup was perfect for slide out of the box.  However, for regular play I would say you would have to lower the action.  But there is plenty of saddle (real bone) to accommodate that kind of setup.  Exceptional value at this price, and as always zZounds is the best.                
I am not a fan of spruce tops and mahogany back/sides.  In fact, I own two acoustics which are solid rosewood with spruce. So... I was skeptical of a 325 dollar parlor which was all mahogany.  WOW!  This guitar sounds good. Very bright and an expanded midrange that makes for wonderful sound. I was also very surprised at the projection from such a small body guitar.  
I basically bought the AP66 for sitting in an easy chair and practicing without a large body instrument on my lap. Now I can sit with both a small and comfortable practice guitar, and all the sounds that help me make better music!  I am definitely a convert to all mahogany guitars.  Rosewood is great for highs and lows, but mahogany is a GREAT overall sounding guitar for all ranges.                
This was my first purchase from zZounds. I am impressed. Guitar was double boxed and shipped quickly. Thanks guys you have a new fan.As for the Ap66, it was what I expected from Alvarez. This thing is flawless from one end to the other. Plays like a dream and has a very nice warm tone. Love it.I was an Alvarez fan anyways and this one did not let me down. Good job.
I do not know about manufacturer support but the review made me rate it.                
Got one of these about a month ago and can't put it down.  I have always wanted a parlor size guitar which Taylor does not have in its offering.  I own several Taylor guitars and I love them all but for this short amount of money, this is a great guitar.  Since it does not come with a case I ordered a Road Runner classical guitar case (polyfoam) and it fits like a glove, I had my guitar tech install a Dean Markley soundhole pickup for quick plug in and retro sound.  Ready to hit the farmer's markets this summer in vintage style!                
Great guitar, fun to play, good set-up. A very nice guitar at a very good price. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a smaller body instrument for everyday playing or as a backup for your primary guitar. You won't regret purchasing this piece. Also shipping was very fast.                
This is my new favorite. the action is great, the tone is much better than expected . I like the slotted head stock. The body size is perfect. I was skeptical about "made in China" but was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The neck width is great. I think I made the best choice at this price for a parlor guitar. Zzounds shipped fast!                
I had been searching for a second acoustic guitar and became interested in parlor guitars, particularly because I am becoming more interested in the fingerpicking/fingerstyle technique. I am not a professional musician or highly experienced player therefore, I did not want to shell out more than $500 - $600 for a guitar. I did a lot of research and decided on purchasing the Alvarez AP66 because of all of the glowing reviews. Not going to lie that I took a risk and purchased this without playing it first however, I feel like I lucked out because I love everything about this guitar. It has a rich, deep sound that packs quite a punch. It is a beautiful instrument that not only looks good, it sounds good as well. I will probably take it in for a set up because the action is a little bit high for me. This has not stopped me from playing it every day since I received it. Very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this guitar without hesitation.                
The mahogany top gives this guitar a sound closer to the old ladder braced guitars of the 30's, which is great for fingerpicking blues and folk music. It's a 'clearer' sound but there are still nice, very well balanced harmonics, making it even better than the old ones. But it definately is not a dreadnaught sound.                
The simple abalone inlay around the soundhole is beautiful. The lack of inlays on the fingerboard makes it looks classy in my opinion. There are dots on the side of the neck. The overall color and finish is very nice.                
I put 13's (mediums) on this guitar right away. The 12's that came on it sounded kind of thin, almost cheap. 13's produce a little more bass and give an overall richer sound. It was easy to change the strings. The low action makes it easy to play. The body shape is great, it fits in my lap nicely.                
VERY nice high quality construction and finish. When you look at the details, like the bridge, the nut, the braces inside, the straightness of the neck, and the fret ends, you know this guitar was made under strict supervision.                
It seems like this guitar could, and should, sell for $500 at least.                 
Haven't dealt with the company.                
The longer body (meets the neck at the 12th fret) and the simple sound hole, combined with a great looking finish and that cool slotted headstock give this guitar a wow factor of 11.                
This is a solid, nice playing, great looking guitar. I wanted a guitar for fingerpicking and occasional strumming. This is it. The neck width is a little wider and the neck a little thicker than a lot of acoustic guitars. I like this. I gives me something to hang on to and the strings don't feel cramped.                
The Alvarez AP66 Parlor wowed me with its looks when I unwrapped it. It wowed me with its full range of sound when I played it. The setup was decent. The highs and mid-range notes crisp and clear, and the low end note with their surprising "boom" pleased me to know end. I fingerpick old blues tunes, and the alternating bass notes really set the rhythm for the mids and highs. The intonation was fine, and knowing that with use the sound will get better gives me something to look forward to. All-in-all, a great guitar for a very fair price. (Haven't had experience with the manufacturer's support.)                
This is an excellent parlor size guitar, with all Mahogany top, back and sides. It sounds and plays great. Tone is very even through out the range, without being overly bright.Overall construction is very clean and well executed. The finish is a beautiful vintage sunburst.                
I just received this today, the setup is excellent and the fit and finish of the guitar is perfect. The guitar's tone and volume really exceeded my expectations.                 
Sounds woody, plenty of volume, doesn’t compress until you really dig into it, built well, and played great out of the box. I prefer the non-electric version so I can explore different pickups. Sounds just as nice as many high-end parlors I’ve played!                
The guitar arrived shortly and in perfect shape and in tune. Right away I noticed the sound and it is now by favorite little guitar, so pleasant and easy to play as well as hardly ever needs tuned.  I tried several guitars I have by singing or humming a hum in to the sound hole. By far the Alvarez resonates louder, longer, and even sets the strings humming with this voice test of the response!                
Great guitar, the sound that comes out of this parlor guitar is really unreal. It's as loud as a dreadnought and so easy to play Solid Mahogany Top with real Bone nut and Saddle at this price. zZounds had it on my door step in 2 days, 2nd guitar I have purchased from them in the past 12 months awesome job zZounds!                
Very Nice little guitar.  Mine came without the pick guard which I kind of like.  In my opinion it sounds better dropped down a half step.  It arrived a lot faster than I expected.  Over all a very good experience with ZZsounds.                
amazing tone, beautiful finish, best bang for your buck by far                
Great little guitar. Plays great and sounds great. Well constructed and finished. Action was great right out of the box. Sings. Great guitar for the money!!                
Looks exceeded my expectation but was brand new and still had a few blemishes. Plays absolutely amazing!! The tone rivals that of guitars 5-8 times more expensive. New favorite acoustic for writing and noodling at home.                
slightly alrger than a seagull parlor, this guitar is very well appointed..plays well, full rich sound..I would say that it can hold its own with parlor guitars that cost several thousand- of course there is a difference but for the money, this one isn't bad at all..I have several expensive acoustics but they are a bit fragile..this guitar is sturdy and lets face it, if something happens to it, it is only $350- so you can move on easily..a $3000 martin loss is bit harder to live with..I give this one an overall 4 star- I prefer a bit luighter finish on the top just because I think you get more natural wood sound resonance..but this guitar is a keeper all the way.                
I can't put this guitar down, it's so easy to play with the small body but a LARGE sound the 12 Fret to the neck puts everything right in front of you. In short the best $350 Bucks I have ever spent, buy this guitar you won't be disappointed.                  
Great parlor guitar for the money. Many musicians buy the name, and others buy quality. This is one of those guitars that you just can't put down. It Sounds clean. it's tone is much better than other guitars I tried more than double it's price before ordering from it zzounds.                
I'd been researching a parlor guitar for some time prior to this. I had basically settled on a Washburn because I'd been able to play one in a Guitar Center and it sounded pretty good. But I knew that whatever I was going to get, I'd get it from Zzounds because, well- the payment plan. After searching the site for a while I started looking closely at the Alvarez AP66E. I was attracted by other reviews and I really wanted electronics onboard so I could stop chasing microphones around on stage. I saw a lot of videos on Youtube, but the truth is, I settled on this guitar without ever playing one.I expected it to sound good due to the videos I'd seen- but it sounded better than that. Punchy and bright and really easy to play. I tuned it right out of the box, (on the porch actually,) and everything worked nicely. I plugged it into some amps and I loved how it responds. I have another mahogany top guitar, so I wasn't worried about that- very warm and resonant; and it looks gorgeous. I'm leaving a lot out, but I have to say I really like this guitar...Things are mellowing out finally, but for a while there I was neglecting my other instruments...                
I didn't want to spend a lot on my first parlor because I wasn's sure if I'd like a small bodied acoustic. Price on this model was very reasonable and the reviews I read sealed the deal. The pictures don't do the guitar justice; this is a very nice looking instrument- love the slotted headstock. Out of the box, however, this was the worst "set-up" I'd ever seen. Don't know what kind of strings it shipped with, but a new set of Elixirs was the first order of business. (Personal preference). Intonation was horrible, action was terrible. I realize that for the money, they're not going to go the extra mile for proper adjustment, but this was really bad- initially regretted the purchase. After a trip to my favorite local luthier however, totally different story. This guitar is a pure joy to play. It has a beautiful tone, is extremely responsive to hammer-ons and pull-offs, and the short neck really lends itself to bending the strings for playing blues.The electronics dial in very nice when performing, and the small parlor size is amazingly comfortable for sittin' and pickin'. This guitar is a very good value. You will not regret the purchase, just plan on a trip to your luthier as soon as it arrives.
Gave a 1 on Manufacturer Support only because I haven't dealt with them and a rating is required.                 
I would consider myself lucky to own this guitar. Out of the box, the action was perfect and the strings were good (I haven't changed them). Sound quality for this guitar superb and well balanced. I was set on to purchase a Taylor 214ce but after a final test of the taylor. I saw this guitar and just wondered how a parlor guitar sounds like. Tested and it felt right to my senses. Tested another parlor guitar, in just two chords returned it and did a comparison between the Taylor and Alvarez. I normally don't go for looks when buying a guitar but the finish on Alvarez has a big part. I never thought of owning an Alvarez but because of the comfort, I did. I can't put it down and very easy to play on. For some reason my finger tips don't feel sore after hours of playing. Most of my guitar friends were surprised by the balance, tonality, comfort and resonance of this guitar. Well worth the money.                
Right away I was taken by the acoustic sustain. The box really rings. The action is right where I need it to access the whole neck. There was the ever-so-slightest slap of strings on fretboard, but it was just how I like it. I'm sure you could set the action higher by adjusting the truss rod.                
The on-board tuner works great. Often when I tune with a machine I have a disagreement between what IT says and what my ear tells me. This seems right on target.The sound gear is also good- there's even a sound "notch" and "presence" control. Also, I appreciate having TWO power outlets that are NOT on the strap-button.                 
I find this a very playable guitar. Bright acoustic sound and electric sound that's as good as your equipment. I have a Fender Acoustasonic Junior, and have tried both instrument and mic channels with this guitar and the possibilities seem endless.. I also tried it mic'd with a Shure 57 and it's bright and full sounding.                
I was immediately impressed by how beautiful it is. The upper bout is a little less than ten inches across, so it's as small as you'd expect a parlor guitar to be. A well-laid clear coat finish really highlight the wood. The head-stock inlay and abalone sound-hole inlay is pretty, and just about all I'd want on a guitar. The tuners look good- really everything looks good on this instrument.                
I am reading reviews where people who own much more expensive guitars think this one is better or just as good. I agree. I have spent a long time trying out parlor guitars in high-end stores, and I very seriously like this one- the one that was delivered to my house YESTERDAY- the best.                
No problems with the company. It was zZounds.com, who not only got this instrument to me in two days, but extended me CREDIT to buy it. It wasn't expensive at $459.99, and still, I was able to buy it making four payments with no interest. This makes it possible for anyone to own a good quality musical instrument. Frankly, I don't think anyone else is doing that...                
I am certain this is going to become my composer's guitar. The ease of handling and the way you can take it anywhere is going to make it a constant companion. 
I will say, just so this doesn't sound too over-the-top that I wasn't too impressed with the manufacturer's warranty. Nobody walks around with their receipt for the rest of their lives- and, well that's what serial numbers are for. Oh well, I don't expect anything to go wrong with it anyway...                
Well, I knew I was going to like this guitar, but I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it is. 
I got it out of the box right on the porch and after a few key turns I was playing it. 
It was bright sounding in just the way I hoped it would be. I plugged it in and was even more impressed. I think people want to use terms like, "beginner" or "starter" guitar- but I think it's as good as anything I've ever played like it.                
I have been looking for a small body blues guitar. Something that had singing highs good mids, chunky bass, comfortable and fun to play. This guitar fits the bill for me. I was able to use it playing live in a rock blues band and kept it under control, although it was vibrating big time. The electronics worked really well and I was playing through a PV bandit. It's actually quite beautiful in its simplicity. I love the green abalone inlays. The carved Rosewood back is four pieces. They did a really nice job matching it so it looks almost like book matched two piece back. The top is decent, it has the tighter grain near the sound hole getting wider towards the bouts. The winter summer grain it's not super defined as you would expect a higher quality instrument, but it does have some compression would like The winter summer grain it's not super defined as you would expect a higher quality instrument, but it does have some minimal compression flaking that makes the top stiffer. It also is kind of pretty. I believe that this particular top makes the high notes really sing. The neck is super straight, the fret material is a little soft and the edges of the front along the knack need to be filed down as they are a little catchy as you slide up and down the neck. The action is a little high but not bad, totally playable. The intonation seems really good. So it needs a little fine-tuning on the set up which I would expect with a new production instrument. I've had it four days and have played it maybe 10 hours, and One fret is buzzing. It's the G string second fret. Pretty inconvenient. With the shorter string scale and the 12 fret neck you can really bend the strings. It's pretty cool. I have never purchased a brand new acoustic guitar. Overall I think this is an excellent instrument for the money. I had my guitar guru friend check it out and he was duly impressed. So I expect to spend a little money on the set up and leveling the frets after I get it broken in a little more. I bought this Alverez Because I have another one that is a beautiful copy of the Martin HD 28. It's a great acoustic guitar, better than many Martin's that I have played that cost 10 to 15 times as much money. So I took a leap of faith on this purchase and I believe that it was a good call. Alvarez may never be what people believe Martin is, but if you look at the instrument and not the name that I think you'll be happy . Hope you find this helpful.  I almost forgot, the tuners work great.                
Been playing classical guitar professionally for many years. I have played so many, handmade, factory, etc. For once in life, I got the babe I have been seeking. This guitar is just magical. The basses are truly booming and the trembles are sweet as cake, perfectly balanced with precise intonation. I have owned customs for over 5k and bought this one for only 2K, what a steal. This is not a beginner or intermediate level guitar, it is professional. I've only had it about a year and the sound is only getting better (cedar top at that). I am not one to write reviews, but felt this is worthy of it. I will never, ever sell this guitar, it is my with me for life. If you may be considering this guitar, rest assured you made the best decision.                 
I've owned my cym75 for three months. I agree with previous reviewers that the finish could have been better. Overall, this is a great guitar worth every penny. The construction, look, feel, playability and sound are top drawer!                
overall,  acceptable, but disappointing, I almost sent it back, the rosewood back and side pores were not filled in properly during construction which caused the top finish to sink into the pores causing a cratering effect, this happens when the construction process is rushed,  you will not see this on instruments created by a good luthier,  but at $2000. sight unseen , you take this risk,  quality luthiers will charge $5000 to $ 10000 for a good instrument...  after talking with some luthiers about it , it was decided it wasn't such a bad thing, as long as it sounded good,  which it does at that price point... heartbreaking, but that's the risk you take with an instrument purchased online...                
I can't compliment this guitar enough. Looks, feel, and sound blow me away. I've been in love with this guitar since day 1, if you are in the market for a small body finger-picker, look no further.                
The Alvarez Delta DeLite is hands down one of the best smaller Parlor size guitars I've owned. For its size you will not be disappointed most my musician friends are jealous at the sound it produces and the volume for small gatherings or performances. This is rated for kids but don't be fooled it is compact but definitly not just for kids/beginners. I bought this one as a blemished. Their was nothing wrong with this guitar could not have beat their price..zZounds has the best customer service by far some have said differently but I have yet to experience that.                
I've never owned a Yari before, read quite a bit of information on history. The guitar is well thought out, Gotoh tuners, bone nut ànd saddle. Ebony bridge pins, the bridge system is very unique, definitely changes the sound, such a well balanced guitar, mids, highs and lows are full and even. My Taylor 816 does not have the sound this guitar has, and the Taylor is no slouch. I would never sell this guitar, watching the few craftsmen at Yari in Japan hand shape the neck without the use of a computer ran machine is incredible.                
Very loud. Quality and beauty describe the tone, timbre and sound. I'm real old. Serious player and 45+ yr acoustic guitar tech. I currently own Martin D-18, Gibson AJ, Martin SWD all cherry including neck, Guild JF30 1982, Yamaha L20A, and around 15 other 40+ yr old acoustics. My DYM75 is a fine fine guitar. I like it more than any of my guitars. I like a great cedar top. Only my Yamaki Custom 1971 has a solid top of cedar. My DYM75 does not compress to my ear at hardest picking and strumming volumes.  I could go on and on about the Alvarez Yairi but won't. At the expense of looking naive I will just say that everything considered (price not a factor) this is my favorite acoustic since my first one in 1958.                 
Can't put it back down.  Treat it like a King. 
Suggest these improvements:  include literature about Yairi craftsmen and a guitar care manual.                
I wanted a Smaller Guitar to pack around surinf my Travels and I Have other Alvarez  Acoustic Guitars , From The '70s and onward , The Guitar is like everyone elses Brand name where it started out in the USA and years later all in China , I thought this was a Bad Idea until i started my own business and Labour Cost is the biggest inflating factor of any Bottom line , I am not going to turn this review in the past, present and future , I am going to tell you , The workmanship , Materials and Cost is whats important , Finally someone is making a Guitar with top level wood and making it affordable , I love this guitar after I spent a few hours breaking in the Strings and it is  a sound right in the pocket                 
great guitar, great price. Tuning gears are high quality, was pleased to find out there is an installed transducer pickup. Used this as a flatwound travel project with 13 gauge chromes. Very happy with this product!                
as a guitar snob I was hesitant on buying a alvarez guitar.after reading the info on it I took the chance and all I can say is WOW . its better than I could have asked for . the fit and finish is perfect and the sound right out of the box is as good or better than my 000 15m ( martin) . no joke this guitar is awesome and im very happy to give it a 5 star review...nice job .                
This all solid body mahogany guitar is breath taking not just from its sheer beauty, but the build quality is excellent. When I pick it up to play I go through a moment of awe and appreciation for the fine instrument I have in my hands. This guitar is an exceptional bargain for its quality. It has totally soothed my guitar acquisition syndrome (GAS as players call it).It came perfectly set up all I had to do was tune it up out of the box. The images that Amazon provides don't do it just. Go to youtube and search for this guitar, watch and listen to the demos and reviews of this guitar. This is the best $1000 you will ever spend on a guitar, and it comes with a beautiful classy hard case. Yes, it only costs $699 but it punches well into the $1800 range of comparable Martins, Taylors or Gibsons.Build quality is impeccable. I know eventually the prices on these Alvarez Masterwork guitars is going to rise. It is inevitable as the quality is great. Alvarez went through a period where ownership changed and now the ownership is back in the hands of the original company, and the quality is superb. I love this guitar.                
I bought this for my husband and he just loves it. The sound the make and over all he is very very pleased with this.. So I am so thankful I did a great job finding this for him.. Thank You so much zZounds very happy costumer here,,                
I have been playing for roughly 55 years, and have owned more guitars than I'd like to admit to! I have owned several that were WAY more money than this guitar. I don't think you'll find a warmer, better balanced guitar that projects any better than this instrument! Additionally the looks of this guitar are a perfect match for the sound produced. This guitar is beautiful!!                
Just received this beautiful solid wood guitar and it plays like butter. Made a miner adjustment on the truss rod to lower the action and plays and sounds as clean as my Martin D-16 and Taylor 310!! Great Value and great quality. WOW!!!                
A very high end solid mahogany build at an affordable price. Quality through out. Has a very unique sound finger picked or strummed.  A blend of highs and lows in harmony. You can play this guitar soft or hard.  Comes with a nice velvet lined hard case.
great                
the build and  materials is very very good; top notch; the tuners turn smooth and easy good quality                 
 may not be the loudest but the high s and lows both respond equal;the sound is just as smooth and mellow as the action                
all the above is very good cosmetic beautiful mechanical smooth as silk reliable the fit and feel I think will last me the rest of my life maybe I can hand it down to one of my grand kids                
yes a hell of a lot for the price;;;;;;;;;;                
no have not dealt with the company;;;;the feel finish and build of this guitar I do not feel I will ever have to                
GREAT GUITAR; have two other acoustic;and three ele,guitars;;the Alvarez MDA66 OUT shine and out plays them all;the set up come lower than my other guitars lower than two I payed to have set up sound great plays easy I am an old man one year player with each acoustic purchase I have made the price also went up a 100 or two;;;but this is the last acoustic;;;;;;;;;unless I get a higher priced ALVAREZ;;cant image a better sounding guitar;;maybe lounder but not better                
I was counting down the days until it arrived .In my mind I was sure I got this right . It's a beautiful looking guitar . I'm just not thrilled with its overall sound . I will give it time to grow on me more . A little disapointed . However the lows do sound good                 
Just received this today. Beautiful guitar with a great tone. I bought this because it was all solid mahogany. I like balanced tone of an all mahogany guitar and also own a 1951 Martin 00-17 and a 1999 Martin OM-15. The sound compares favorable with both of the Martins. I also wanted a short scale guitar and your talking over $2k for a Martin with similar specs. The workmanship is flawless both inside and out. If your a fan of mahogany, this offers great bang for the buck.                
I bought an Alvarez parlor guitar that had a solid mahogany face. The sustain was crazy (could run my pick across all six strings and the sound went on indefinitely). Was so impressed that I wanted to delve into the masterworks series and so got this guitar. I have to say, I enjoy playing my rosewood guitars, but that is a whole different (and wonderful) experience. This guitar is very articulate in the mid range, but without a significant loss of highs or lows. I am a dreadnaught guy, but thought I would try something a bit smaller to play standing up with a shoulder strap.  This guitar fits the bill nicely.  BTW, loved the deal with the free ukulele. It is much more impressive in person and almost seems like a min-parlor guitar with nylon strings. My wife has small hands and cannot finger a traditional fretboard. I am going to give her the ukulele for her birthday.                
I ordered this from zZounds without having seen one in person. I had played Martins and Taylors at my local music store but didn't want to spend that kind of money. I ordered the guitar on a Monday and received it the very next morning, even with free shipping. The guitar came with a very nice hardshell case and a stick-on black pickguard. I installed the pickguard but preferred the look without it so I removed it and traced the shape onto a piece of clear plastic I had (the type that goes on cars) and installed that. Can barely see it and it provides the same protection. The action was just right and the intonation perfect. I really like the size and shape of the neck. I've got fairly large hands and there's enough meat to it but I don't think it would be an issue for someone with smaller hands. The sound is great with good note clarity and it's not too boomy sounding. My only criticism is the finish on the body which is very glossy in person and shows fingerprints very quickly. I'd prefer a more matte finish. Interestingly the neck finish is more matte and feels great. Overall I would say this guitar easily competes with the low-mid level Martins and Taylors at a fraction of the price. The only caveat being it's made in China. If I could afford it, I'd have bought an American guitar as I would prefer to support our economy.                
just bought and receive a beautiful wy-1 natural .these wy-1 were deemed the best hand made guitar in the 90's  I didn't give them much thought after all there are lots of other brands --- then I bought my first one ,then another ,then another and a 4th,now I have 5,selling my taylor and breedloves,yes they are the best hand made guitar EVER made .once played nothing is as good. I LOVE MY WY-1's                
This guitar is light and delicate, perfect for fingerpicking.  Sound reinforcement is old, (mine's from 1990), but less 'tinny' than newer Fishman-equipped guitars.  It is my love, (sorry honey....but you're second!!)                
I run Elixr ultra-lights with this guitar and it is a dream.  I had a Martin parlour-sized guitar made in 1889 until it was ripped off, and this guitar comes as close as anything I've ever encountered in reproducing the action and sound.                
With lights, it almost plays itself                
Very well made with no flaws whatsoever.  Afterall, it's a hand made guitar made by a Japanese craftsman who views each guitar as a prayer to  God.                
It is as close as one can get to the perfect fingerpicking guitar.  I play jazz and folk.  It may not be a good flat-picking guitar, as the highs are emphasized over the lows.                
If somehow I was granted a lottery win, I would most probably go for one of those old guitars I see on the back pages of those guitar magazines simply because I could, but given my present situation, I cant see myself ever getting a replacement.                
The sound is very sweet.  All strings are in balance as to volume.                
Materials and workmanship is as good as it gets. I can't think of another guitar that is better put together                
This guitar is very easy to play.  The frets are very smooth. I  had a little buzzing till I had it professionally setup. the  intonation is excellent.                
AS mentioned above. Terrific quality.                
I also have a Martin that cost more than this one but is harder to play. You get what you pay for and Yairis are handmade from selected and cured woods (at the factory).  They are not overpriced.                
Never dealt with the company.                
It is beautiful.                
I will never sell this guitar.                
My brother used to own an Ampeg rig back in the 70's, so I looked at the new Ampeg range when I wanted to get a small studio bass amp. At first I was a little sceptical that I'd get much for $99.. But, I decided to buy the 8" model just on Ampeg's great rep. Nobody had reviewed this amp/cab. Wow! What a great bit of kit. This kit is really well designed.. AND fabricated. True quality in the build.. heavy, nicely finished and a really nice sound. I'm using (just) an Ibanez Mikro bass so I guess the guitar itself isn't making this amp sound good just by itself? In summary, really nice bass studio/practise amp. I like a clean tone myself and at 2 out of ten on the volume it fills an apartment room easily. Well done Ampeg. Haven't used customer support but you have to rate that.. Change that pls, Zzounds.com?                 
I ordered it on Tuesday morning and it arrived Thursday morning, two days later.  I was very pleased because I needed it that afternoon for two gigs.  I play an acoustic Epiphone Bass Guitar.  The group with whom I play sometimes get pretty loud so I was able to crank the volume pretty loud.  I set the amp on the angle facing up directly toward me so I could know how loud it was.  In the past, a couple of band members have asked me to turn the volume down on a guitar amp belonging to another band member.  I know I had the volume a lot higher than in the past and no one said anything. I asked them how the bass sounded and all said it was fine. I feel the difference is because of the warm sound coming out of the 8” speaker and my ability to adjust the sound to fit the group sound.  I am very pleased with the bass amp and feel it will serve well for any gig I play for, one of which is a large hall with 100 or more people dining and conversing.  It is quite noisy.  I am very pleased for the price I paid.                
I bought this so I could leave my big bass amp at church . Tried to use this at church but to small ! Excellent for home practice not to loud but great for going over my song list ! Can’t beat it for the money ! Plan I buying an orange amp from zZounds soon ! Great service !!                 
I love this amp. It can get reasonably loud when you need it, but also sounds great at low volumes. It has very fat bottom end and never sounds mushy or undefined... and it definitely sounds like an Ampeg. There are plenty of tonal options as well. It's crazy that this little amp is so well made, sounds so great... and is only $99!                
The Ampeg B-108v2 is a great little practice/ small acoustic or jazz jam session amp. It has a nice warm tone that I admittedly have become addicted to. LOL. Light enough for me to toss it in the car.                 
This is the worst piece of gear I've ever owned. If I turn the volume, treble, or mid knobs past 12 o'clock the amp clips. On passive pickups, no preamp. If I turn the bass all the way up the speaker sounds like a worn out 15" that just can't pump anymore. There's an oddly high amount of static. When I plug in headphones the static is louder than the bass. The amp sounds fine at low volume and flat eq. But I just can't believe that Ampeg would make such an awful product. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, just a put around amp I can take room to room. What I got is so terrible I'm not going to even bother with customer service, and by the time I pay for return shipping back to zZounds I wont get anything back out of it that way either. Generally Ampeg makes awesome products, but skip this one. Buy literally anythjng else. It's like a first act with a nice shell. At least it isn't ugly.                
Very impressed with this Bass amp----everything I expected and more. Great sound. A good looking amp and is perfect for small gigs.                
Love everything about this amp.....except the fan noise. It is on par with some bathroom fans at hardware store displays. I was shocked. I played on it for five minutes, wrapped it up nice and neat and put it back in the box it came in and filled out a return from. It is so bad that part of me wonders if it is damaged.If I was going to play loud I am sure the fan noise would not bother me much. Unfortunately, I tend to practice at lower volumes while the family is home. The more I tried to ignore it, the louder it got. I am extremely disappointed.Again, if I could reduce/eliminate the fan noise, I would be on here raving about it. It is built tough. The control layout is fantastic. Fit and finish are first class. The scrambler is sweat.If you plan on playing at moderate or loud levels I think you will be very happy. If you are expecting crystal clear sound at lower levels I think you had better go play on one, better yet just turn one on, before you buy. I wish I had.                
I doubt anyone could go wrong with an Ampeg! I love being able to play along to songs on media wearing headphones which the neighbors love too! And the Ampeg tone and sound is amazing!  Incredibly versatile, get just about any sound I want our need. As for the scrambler I am not a big fan of distorted or overdriven bass, just a touch for the classic sound on the Moving Pictures album by Rush so I'll let others give an evaluation on that.
LOUD, and it THUMPS! don't let 75 watts cool you it'll just your ears!                
Very pleased with this amp. Perfect weight and sound for small to medium venues. Has a the rich bass sound I was looking for. So far no problems.                
Ampeg has always been a fantastic Bass Amp company. They are well known for their build quality and sound, and this Amp does not let down. While the Scrambler function isn't quite on par with the sound you get from a true SVT tube head, it is still very nice. The single 15 has plenty of punch and tone, and the tweeter handles the highs very well. The combo amp would be great for a beginner or a pro. For the price I dont think you can get a better practice Amp.... Notice I do say practice amp.... It works well while playing with others during a practice session, or maybe even a small venue, it will hold its own... BUT as far as a gigging amp for larger spaces it has one draw back, which is the reason I can not give it five stars, NO additional speaker out. The B210 has an additional speaker out, and is a similar price range, which is why I can not figure out why Ampeg did not put a similar Amp head into this combo. I personally prefer a single 15 to a double 10, and If I need an additional speaker, I would rather add another single 15. 
Again, that is personal preference, so I cant knock Ampeg for it too much i guess. 
When I added the Fender bass to my musical repertoire fifty years ago, true bass amps were few and far between. However, the Ampeg Bass Amp line was already there, and Ampeg bass amps had a room-filling warmth that went far beyond the performance offered by the competition. If you can find a used one today, it's probably selling for four or five times what it sold for new. When this new, streamlined model came out it caught my eye immediately. I don't play gigs much any more, at my age, but it's nice to have an amp that could handle a small-to-medium venue-- and it certainly doesn't sound like a practice amp. I haven't been through all the features yet, but the power and tone are THERE, and that's what I was looking for. And the unique wedge-shaped cabinet really causes heads to turn!                
Great sounding amp. I never owned an ampeg combo before. But Ive own a head made by them. I cant remember the model. Anyway it didnt impress me and I sold it. This one does impress me tho. It has any sound you may need. Im strictly an old school R&B bassist. So I like alot of low end. I dont use most of the other features just the eq. It has the power close to 150watts. But of course you get better sounds at about 75 or 80%. I recommend this amp for practice and club gig. NICE AMP
When it come's to Bass Guitar, AMPEG is the bomb!! For years I've tried to reproduce the sound of a ampeg with no success, until I bought one (SVT 810E). I could only use it on concerts, but then Ampeg came out with the New BA-210v2 (a dream come true) small enough for small venues and big enough to get the job done in style. My main bass is a Fender P with emg,s, this amp was made for this bass. The clarity of tone and dept is phenomenal, but what else would you expect from Ampeg?As a life-er bass player no other amp that I've ever played can excite me like this one!!! Thanks Ampeg, and Thank you zZounds for making it so easy to own one!!!
Many times people buy products just because some famous artist did. I prefer to experience it on my on. What I feel or hear is all about my own experience with the instrument.This amp is no doubt an excellent product. Power, depth, tightness, sweetness, and effects all in one single product. I love it!                
I got this amp from zzounds about a month ago and have put it through the test like I do all my amps. It has performed much better than I had anticipated. With a 12" cab underneath it will be powerful enough to play even larger venues. If I play really big venues or out doors I usually rely on the pa or rent a stack anyway so this is perfect for me for it will fit in the backseat or trunk of the car perfectly. The sound is classic ampeg and I especially like the new scrambler feature which gives me the vibe of the older amps I used to play when I first started out on bass. Overall I'm impressed and pleased with my purchase. The only thing I wished they had added was a mid frequency shift like on the svt models.                
Wow! I lost a fender Rumble 500 v3 combo during hurricane Harvey.So I figured try Ampeg this time. The simple eq is more than sufficient. Add a bass sansamp, and opto co impression you get into svt territory. Great value.                
This was the best combo amp I ever purchased. Tone is right on, volume can be too loud                 
I debated endlessly between this combo and the Fender Rumble. Finally I decided to go with the Ampeg, and I was not happy with the decision.
First of all, the good points: The amp really has a great tone. I loved the sounds I was getting from it, adjusting the EQ, Scrambler, etc. gave me a lot of great tones. 
Now the bad points: This thing rattles and buzzes terrible. I tightened up all of the screws, which were loose, but it didn't help. There were still some bad rattles coming from between amp, cabinet, speakers, everywhere. 
Also, the buttons and knobs feel very very cheap. Not good quality at all.
And finally my last issue, when I did take it to practice to try it out, after about an hour the sound just cut out completely. The next day it was fine, but I'm concerned about the longevity of this unit.
Ampeg needs to fix these issues, because it really does sound great.                 
I thought buying an amp online would be okay if it was from a reputable manufacturer like Ampeg I was wrong.
There was a high frequency noise being produced by the amp after a few minuets of being powered up.  I took it to the licensed repair place in town and they got ahold of Ampeg who told them they have received reports of this same problem and to return the amp.  So that's how this purchase went                
I got this delivered with a label saying it was opened.  When I tried to play it all appeared to be good until I plugged in the headphones.  I have a Jamhub which allows me to play silently, so I wanted to see what the headphone port would do in comparison.  Was I in for a rude awakening.  The headphone port worked nicely.  However, after I unplugged the headphone the main speakers would not come back online.  When the headphones are plugged in the main speakers go offline.  It appears the headphone port stayed open preventing any sound from the main speakers.  The bad thing was it happened on a Saturday hours before my annual family reunion performance causing me to have to cancel the engagement.  Would have been nice it I could have gotten emergency support from zZounds.                
I bought this cab right In 2011 and it is still sounding amazing!  at this point it's gone thru hundreds of 3+hour gigs. Still great! 
I got in a car accident with this, my svt 3pro (in a gator rack) and my American fender j/deluxe. I literally cartwheeled! Everything came out fine! The cab got a few small rips but sounded perfect! I took it and my amp into my local tech after just cause I still couldn't believe and it came with flying colors. 
I've pushed this cab hard!! Ive gigged with this every single weekend sometimes twice a week (plus rehearsals!) with 5 to 7 member bands since I got it. (In 3 bands)   
I play mostly reggae so I'm driving a fat low end tone but I'm guilty of loving the funk and slap it up and do some sticato poppy funk as well and it's clear and punctual.  just toured Montana and Cali with one of the reggae bands I'm in. No pa accompaniment just me for some big outdoor farmer market / town hall gigs. I ran it with the Eden WTP600 and it handled it no problem. 
I even have the Zeus red witch sub octave pedal plus the Ehx enigma and Blurst and this thing has taken every sound and kept it sounding true. Never a fart. 
Plus it's lighter than any other 410 I've come across! (Except an aguilar)                 
Got this in February 2012,and I am very pleased with it. Take your typical SVT tone.and add a little more upper mid presence,and thats the sound of the cabinet. Same sound as an SVT but with a little added clarity. I use a Thunderfunk 550B amp,and either Music Man Bongo 5's,or Tobias 6 string basses. They all sound great. Even the guitar player was complimentary of my sound. Best money I ever spent on a cabinet. My only complaint is the wheels. For some reason they put hard plastic wheels on it. I replaced them with hard rubber wheels from Fliptops for about 20.00.                
This Speaker Cabinet was ordered to fulfill a long time desire to mate it with my ' 87 SLM SVT 300 LE Amplifier.  I am not a Bass Player but use it to play a '62 Fender Bass VI through it.  Is sounds wonderful.  I also like the fact that it is all American.  zZounds Play as you Pay plan allowed me to order an expensive Speaker Cabinet I would normally not be able to order.  I go to zZounds for all the items I want and they usually have them.                
The Ampeg micro stack is a good amp. Liked everything about it. The head is great but the speaks went bad within a mouth. Replace with upgraded speaks. It sounds great! I should not had to do that. Never played over 3 on the volume. So if you are going to purchase this amp plan to buy new speakers. Thought I let you know.                
It's super cute, but the construction is MDF and a piece of the Tolex was ripped from a staple not pressed in all the way on the front cover and scraping it away - kind of sucks for a brand new item, but I don't feel like causing a fuss over a little nick.  Just weaksauce quality control...
The sound is good.  Nothing to write home to mom about, but it does have that "Ampeg signature growl" type of sound, for the bedroom.  
It's lacking the gain/master volume controls, but with the dual inputs, its doable.  
It's my favorite amp of all time for bass in the bedroom, but I wouldn't even attempt to ever jam with an acoustic drummer.  Probably for the better, since MDF isn't very road worthy anyway.  
Acoustic guitar sounds decent through it too.  It doesn't have an XLR direct out, but Ampeg isn't known for clean XLR outputs in the past, so I'm not sweating it.  A mic would better capture its essence anyway.  
Its pre-amp pretty much sounds exactly like my Sansamp (which was designed to emulate the Ampeg sound, at least I think so anyway).                  
Awesome little bass stack for small stage gigging. Use 2x10 cab for stage monitoring and run DI into the mains. Effects loop is a bonus, too!                
I own the Microvr amp and 2 210svtav cabs. I bought the second cab after I got the Mircovr set up.  The sound sound you get from this things for the money blows anything else out their out of the water. To get the rated 200watts performance you need a 2nd cab as the load with one cab is 8 ohms at 150 watts. Light weight portability and small footprint size are a plus especially if your space chanllenged.  This thing rocks.                
This is a no frills set up.  Has what you need to have great sound with a headphone jack to play practice in a low noise enviroment.                
It has a 3 band eq section that you can dial in easy to find a sound you like.  Its no svtpro 7  but for the money you will not find a better amp in its class.                
This amp is made solid.  Mimics the old school look of the 70s svt lineup.                
With anything you purchase you wish you could get it for less thats just the way it is. But for the money you will not find a better sounding and well made rig in this class.  The Microvr and 210 svtvr cab set up is da bomb.  If you want portability light weight and the best sound get this AMPEG.                  
I have had no issues with this amp. I have owned it for about 2 years now and play on it alot.  Its an AMPEG.                
This thing looks great sounds great and its and AMPEG.                 
I will always have this amp.  Its perfect for travel to other locations and has enough head room for small venues and recording situations and the sound is truely amazing.                
Has a great tone played thru the matching cab.  Can be cranked with no rattling of cab, good clean, nice bit of growl.  Assuredly could be paired with another cab for good sound.                
Not a ton of tone shaping options, but enough.  It is capable of getting some variety on it's own.                
easy, peasy, lemon squeezy.  roight.  come on, couple of knobs and switches, it's not like running a huge sound board.                
Ampeg, mostly great and long term name, but will it hold up cause it's made in an asian country?  Time will tell.  Most Korean and Japanese made are great, with China and Indonesian following.                
great value                
awesome little beast                
I will be having this little beast                
I bought the Ampeg Microvr Head originaly with one Ampeg 2-10" cabinet as a part of matched set, as most people do - about three months a later I bought another cabinet - so now I'm often running two of the same cabinets and the head together. When you plug in the second cabinet the rig gets noticeably louder in this set up, and also appears to have a much more deeper bass tone(if you want it). Adding the second cabinet added $300 to my rig - but if you can afford it, the sound is far superior to just the single cabinet, and gives you a lot of flexiblity. 
For smaller indoor venues like playing bass behind people with pugged in acoustic guitars, I run the head with just one cabinet and it sounds fine - both tone and volume wise. When I playing along with a drummer most of the time I opt for using two cabinets rather than just one. At higher volumes - like playing with a drummer it just sound stronger and fuller in every respect than by using just the single 2 10" cabinet.
I'm either running a recent custom C.F. Martin Acoustic/ Electric Bass guitar, or a Fender Precession Bass, through the rig - depending on who and what I'm playing on music wise. It works excellent with either instrument and I am very happy with the set up. Even with just one cabinet you won't be dissapointed.                
Happy with everything that it came with feature wise. Didn't like the stock power cord that came with because it was very stiff and hard to wind up - Ampeg should switch vendors and get a power cord supllier that could offer them a more felxible cord of the same quality that you cound wind up easier.                
Tone controls are easy to figure out and use. Rear connections on the amp are simple, straight forward and easy to use, and hook things up. I often use a Martin acoustic bass guitar with this rig - so I use a Fishman DI preamp in between my bass and the amp - this being done basically to help control feedback at higher volumes (especially when playing out door gigs) and to fine tune the tone on the acoustic bass a bit more. My Fender bass sounds fine with out the Fishman preamp and the controls on the amp head work well with it - giving you many mutiple tone combinations depending on how you set them. Also my Fender fretless bass sounds really good through the amp and the matched speaker that you will most likely buy with the head.                
Quality seems very high. After about two years of owning and active giging - it is holding up extremely well. Over the last year or so I have taken it out on local gigs about twice a week, So it's been out of my house more than a hundred times so far, and there haven't been any issues so far - all this in all kinds of weather and temperatures. I had black vinyl covers made for the head (from a custom amp cover innernet company)and for both speaker cabinets as soon as I bought everything - so even aften trucking the units all over the place for quite awhile now they still all look fresh and brand new.
The power cord that came with it was very stiff and always hard to roll up - so I bought an after market cord on a website cord supplier that was more flexible and easier to wind up. I've used the after market power cord every since. The head has a fan in the back that runs whever the unit is powered up, that when you first get the amp drives you crazy - because it appears to sound so loud. Truth is though while you may hear it running in your house when practing - you never do at gigs. At any gig the room and enviroment background noise easily drown it out right away - you just never hear the fan running at all. When I first got it I though something was wrong with the fan - there wasn't. Its an Ampeg thing - that is the low fan noise in a quiet background setting. Keeps everything cool inside the head - so you can certainly live with it. I got used to it after awhile and don't even notice it anymore. No one has ever commented to me anywhere about any fan noise coming from my amp. So don't think something is wrong with the fan when you first get the head.                
The original outlay (about $600 for the head and one matching cabinet) is a bit steep compared to several other small bass amps on the market out there - but you get what you pay for I guess. Due to the price saddly - alot of bass players might not be able to buy one and will go with something cheaper out there. Before buying this I looked around for about two months at other rigs on the innernet, at music stores, and at othet musicians' bass rigs when watching them perform. This unit was replacing a Hartke Kickback 12 - which I used for about three years for the same type of smaller gigs - which is for more low volume type of dealsthat I play at - where you don't have to worry about shaking the room and making the paint peel of the walls when you hit your low E string on something like Springsteen's "Pink Cadillac".
I still feel that I made the correct choice and am happy with the head and the speakers matched for this unit. Should this head get stolen or something I wound't hestiate to go out and buy the excat same head and setup again. Its made well- very light weight and suits my playing needs perfectly at the moment. If I was still playing full time big time rock more than I do now - I would buy an Ampeg SVT with a 8 10" cabinet, which is sort of the "Rolls Royce" of bass amps - but I'm not - so this works for me just fine!
I took a chance when I first bought this head because no one that I knew owned one- I never saw anyone using one anywhere - and there were no customer reviews out there yet to read. My purchase was based on my own personal needs and the reputation of Ampeg in general - when it comes to bass amps. I do own another larger Ambeg Classic speaker 15" cabinet, and some Hartke cabinets, that I use with an older vintage Acoustic Control head that I really like. Bottom line is the amp and matched cabinet are worth the money and I could recomend buying it. Its like a Martin acoustic guitar- kind of expensive - but well worth it because its made extremely well and sounds very good.                
Never dealt with the Ampeg factory people ever - so I don't know. I have some other Ampeg equipment, and never had any issues with anything either, so I never called for any warranty service.                
Design looks cool enough I guess - looks kind of like a "toy" classic Ampeg SVT. But -I guess that's what its supposed to look like right? Other musicians often make jokes and laugh at me when I am first setting it up someplace - then when they hear the amp and cabinets they are always curious how it can be so loud, and sound so good tone wise. Often other bass players come up to me and ask all kinds of questions about it after hearing me play through it at a gig. They always want one!                 
This head along with two matched 2 10" cabinets are used quite alot as one of my setups for giging out in smaller places like coffee houses, farmers markerts, jam sessions in peoples basements, and at small bars. When I play outside at something - let's say anything larger than a farmer's market, and are playing louder I use something different - which is a Ampeg 15" cabinet on the bottom, and one of the 2 10" cabinets on the top from this small rig. Believe it or not this amp head can power up both and a good volume - it looks kind of funny seting on top of that large of a speaker combination given its tiny size - but it does work out just great. Its a very versatile head and can be used in lots of different set ups with several different speaker combinations. Don't let the size fool you!                
I order this head even after I read some reviews that talked about fan noise. It is lightweight and powerful. Yes, there is some fan noise that is relevant only in a studio setting where the amp is next to the cab and picked up by the mic. A little distance or isolation and mixing in the DI signal right out of the amp takes care of that problem. I use this with a newly purchased GK Neo 115iii cabinet and it is awesome. Tone for days with a range for any style. I have been playing Ampeg since the mid-60's and wanted to stay with that tone for my P-basses and my Ampeg fretless. If weight is a concern, this combination will handle your concerns and deliver the tone. I do hope Ampeg comes back with a fix for the noisy fan and that ZZounds will follow up with them. I have not used the manufacturer's support so I am neutral on that.                
For the money you can't beat the tone this thing has.                
Not a lot of frills.  What is there is great tone and eq abilities.                
Plug and play.                
Have been exceptionally happy with all my ampeg products.                
Low cost of the combination of the amp and 210 cab leaves you wondering how you can pay $600 for what you usually pay $2000 to sound like.                
Loud Technology experience has been fine as I have only needed a few parts and was treated well.                
I am buying another extension cab because I can leave one at practice and one at the recording studio and just carry the amp back and forth.  If I wish I can run them both with the amp.                  
Best Tone for the $                
I think the amp sounds great. I bought an extra SVTAT210 cab so I can run it at 4ohm and get the full 200 watts. I have played several gigs with it and so far I love it.                 
If you have been shopping for an amp, look no further. This is the one. In the early nineties, I tested every bass amp there was and and none suited me other than the Ampeg SVTIII and the 4x10 cab. Used (and still am) a Fender Precision with EMG pickups. Some amps had there good points, but I was looking for fat with punch, so Ampeg was for me. Time marches on and that rig was a monster to lug and load. Ten years ago I got a Behringer BX600. Easier to lug, but lacked that rich full bottom that the guitar players always complimented the Ampeg on. Looked at this Micro VR for a while, skeptically, but recently bought it. Four gigs later and the guitar players are raving about the bass again. Me too! AND it is so light! Had casters on the other stuff. Not this one. Even the fiddle player (female) likes it (she said it's cute, too!). Plays well with effects (Source Audio) without haveing to cut back on the gain. It' has the most even sound across all four strings. It is a fan cooled MOSFET so if you run it hard, the fan will run faster and noisier but cools quickly and will be ok in time for the next quiet song. Also worth noting that it will handle octaves well below the fattest string.                
the 2x10 speakers give great sound for no matter what style you play rock, punk, metal, funk, jazz, etc... Much better than combos I've tried within the same price range! Except it does struggle if you do end up playing metal and are forced by the super loud guitarist and you end up cranking the gain and volume past 7.. i mean it doesn't sound bad, it doesn't cause the speakers to sound like they are going to blow... but it does change the tone significantly in a undesirable non-metal way.. rather than being deep and heavy, the louder the volume = the higher the highs and extreme string noise and this cannot be remedied by the low or high knobs... so unless your going to be busting out some funk in your metal set, also another note, if you push the gain past 7 but keep the volume at normal levels, it acts like a distortion... So if your going to be playing metal or similar I'd recommend looking for a 1x15 combo amp or investing in a fullsize stack...However, if you are going to play all other genres, this is a good Micro Stack!                
The best feature about this stack is it's Size! 
My main reason for buying this over a normal stack or a larger combo amp is I drive a small 2 door, 2 seater sports car convertible and have a ridiculously small trunk space. So the Micro VR stack worked out perfect! I can fit the stack on the passenger seat and secure it with the seatbelt, then I am able to fit the head into a normal sized backpack (makes it convenient to carry along with all the cables and stuff) and put that on the floor in in front of the passenger seat.                
has the basics you need and nothing more. much like it's vintage styled big brothers. it just has gain, low, mid, high, volume, an active cut switch and limiter.. all the essentials and nothing more. however as a bonus, it does have an effects loop and XLR out so you could add on a preamp, sonic maximizer, EQ, or other rack equipment if you desire a totally custom sound. and on top of this dual speaker outputs (i've ended up using the Micro VR head on a larger 1x15 speaker and 1x12+1x10 bass cabs that were at a rehearsal studio and the amp was able to power those great!                
it's all the quality you expect from Ampeg! Durable, great looking, and secure!                 
couldn't beat the price for one of these especially if you are looking for an item which is super portable, provides great sound, can be used at home, at rehearsal, and on the road!                
never had to contact Ampeg once because they make quality products.                
Ampeg! that says it all..                
this is an awesome item, however I do sometimes wish I had my Ampeg 8x10 Classic and SVT-4Pro again... but if i did, I don't know how I would be able to transport it as I do not own a large vehicle anymore.. oh well...                
Great little amp for small to medium size gigs. Easy to move and that vintage ampeg sound to boot! I normally run an 8x10 with a 500 watt head but it is just way too much for the local clubs and a pain to move. I got this mostly as a practice rig but felt it would be worth trying at a gig. It was perfect I was able to crank the gain and get a nice vintage fuzz sound and it kept up with the drums fabulously. Easy to move I cant stress how easy it is to get around and if I play anywhere too big for the 2x10 to handle I will just direct out to the PA and problem solved.                 
Gives the low ends and high ends I was looking for while being portable. Good Construction. I Luv the ability to attach the head to top and it zips up nicely to remain portable. Very good Construction and the included caster work very well. I put a tilt arm on the back of mine to be able to tilt it back so I can monitor my sound and it works great. I do wish they built tilt arms in to these units to give you that option as well as handle on the side would make it easier to move around and/or stack.                
Both the build and sound quality on this cabinet is amazing. I've been playing Bass for over 20 years and this is definitely the best cabinet I've owned. I've never had to contact Ampeg for anything so I have no idea how their customer support is.                
When Ampeg says true Ampeg tone they mean it this , cab is great it is just what I've been missing 2,4,or 8 10s don't get me wrong  sound good , but pair them with a fifteen , there's nothing like it its what my ears need to hear I wanted a classic SVT but I didn't think it had the power I needed , I needed a cab that I could use alone on small gigs , and pair it with my PR-410HLF on bigger gigs  this one does it and it fits behind the passenger seat in my Mustang GT thanks Ampeg and Zzounds !                
I wish it had a speakon jack                 
I'd replace it !                 
Fantastic, tight cabinet! I paired it with the PF500 and it blows away my previous MarkBass equipment. I will always be an Ampeg family member!!!

I have an Fliptop from 1963 which I love, but it is a bit finicky and not up to travel anymore.  While this amp doesn't have the same style, the tone is dead on. It is a simple set of controls, sounds big, clean and loud. The DI feature (built in load box) is great, perfect for recording. If you want a classic Ampeg tone without the cost of vintage gear, this is the perfect solution.                
I have it paired with my trusty PF-500 and it sounds amazing. I used my head with other cabs in the past and finally got the matching cab for it and I am glad I did. Being a sealed cab makes it nice and tight sounding. I would recommend to anyone looking for punchy tight bass. If you want big fat low end, not sure you will be happy.                
Mine's arrived after a day I ordered it probably because where the item came from is in the same state as the destination.  So, kudos to zZounds for this!
Looks like the item was built pretty well.  When I opened the lid, there were no lose parts and everything was in the box (screws, speaker cable, caster wheels, and documentation).
The head I use is the Ampeg PF-500, and hooked up to this is an Ibanez SR505 - a five string for those unfamiliar with it.  Once I unpacked and installed everything, I hooked it up to my amp, then played a couple of songs.  Tweaked it, tweaked it some more, and I finally got the setting I want.  I had to make adjustments to make sure that the 5th string sounds solid.  After this, I tried finding my other settings based on the genre of music and playing style.
I have yet to find out what this cab can do in a gig.  Of course, these are 2x10's so I had to push the bass eq up a bit than the 4x10 I have (made by acoustic).  But that's always the case anyway when you work with new equipment (as it is always said, "tone is king").
I like the convenience brought about by being able to attach the amp head to the cab's lid.  Don't worry about the lid rattling.  There are 4 fasteners keep the lid shut tight.  However, I had to remove the little handles on the front panel of the amp head because they were hitting the inner "walls" of the cab when I flip the lid to prepare it for transport.  Removing those required an allen wrench.
I will need another cab to maximize the potential of my amp (500w @ 4ohms - two 8ohms).  On paper, the low-end frequency are just about the same between PF-115HE and PF-210HE.  I might have to find a place to test the PF-115HE first.  But as it is, I'm still undecided as to which to get.
All in all, this PF-210HE cab sounds very good, has moderate weight, and looks pretty well-built.                
Doesn't push a whole lot of air, but still sounds good... Loud enough to hang in there with a full band, but won't shake anyone's soul... You may want the 1x15 if you're worried about a thump...                
Compressors okay... Fliptop is convenient as well... Pretty to the eyes...                
Simple... Too simple...                
Its an ampeg so you know you"ll get that famed and befuddling ampeg tone!                
Cant find a better deal! Portaflex for the workin man...                
Everything is made in China!                
Sounds good, but could use a bit more oomph for a wow...                
Gets loud but doesnt push air...                
I needed something for my 7 yr old daughter and got this with the ampeg pf500 watt amp. It sounds great and has the valume to keep up with the 2 guitars and drums. We love the tone you get out of it.                
They r pretty direct and simple so she can get whatever tone she is looking for                
It is built Well, I did my homework since me and my son play drums and don't know enough about bass to have an educated idea, so from the other reviews I saw that the casters wasnt the best I got it home and replaced them.                
Haven't used them                
When performing, I use three different basses. A Fender Jazz, Ibanez GSR206SM, and an Pedulla Thunderbuzz. So it's all of the major basses 4,5 and 6 strings both fretted and fretless. I use a Behringer MX400, a mixer, so I do not have to plug and unplug all of the time as the PF350 only has one input. I have a typical Ampeg tone from all of my basses, a nice deep but mellow with just enough treble on top.                
The features are not many. So in my opinion, that's what is nice. It's nice and simple to set up, and yet the sound is to die for.                
As far as ease of use. The simpler the better. Especially when you have a lot of setting up to do and you have an orchestra director that's in a hurry.                
Quality is amassing. This bass head is built like a tank. Like I said, I have used this head allover the country and in venues large and small                
Value. I do not believe you will find a more useful bass amplifier at this price, with ease of use, or as reliable as the PF350.                
Since I purchased this new, I have never had to call Ampeg. But I trust that if I ever have to, they will treat me well.                
The WOW FACTOR is when those that you are performing with, say to you, that they have never heard a bassist with as clear a sound or as loud as your performance. Other musicians have said to me that they can actually feel the performance in their chests. In the practice room, it can shake the floor.                
I purchased this head in I believe 2015. I have traveled and used this allover the country. From small groups to various shows. Including a show in Madison Wisc. at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum with over one hundred other musicians and vocalists. I used the PF350 with two vintage B15N cabs and it just rocked hard and loud. It easily cut above trumpets, trombones, euphoniums, and a drummer. Including keyboard and other musicians. But the best part was I did not use the DI output.                
I actually bought this as a practice amp because of its size, and it works well for that. It doesn't really punch like I thought a 350W amp would. But I'm used to tubes. My 100W tube amp seems to put out more db's than this thing. But it also weighs 50 lbs. The 7 lb PF350 is nice and easy to tote around. Sound is good and clean like all Ampeg things are.                
at first I was wasn't sure I wold want an ampeg just the sound is usually tinny and I just didn't like it 
now after owning it for a month this thing rocks very punchy and handles the low end better than I anticipated
I haven't ran thru my full rig yet but even just one cabinet I'ds enough for this                
the features are cool it's pretty basic set up wish it had flashing lights
for fun, it needs a gig bag all it's own would add to cool factor                
I plugged in adjusted controls and whammo!
I found my sound                
I am so happy this is light I think its 8 ponds but man it's nice
after lugging all my stuff to stage it's nice that the head is light                
totally worth the price . ampeg is awesome                
I have yet to call ampeg but I'm sure they would help if I neededit                
ok it's got a purple light in the center I think of it as a tractor. beam you looking at and can't stop                
I expect this head will last with care, I will use this till it dies or explodes from too much use but the on board cooling system                
I needed a single 12" bass cabinet & chose the Ampeg Portaflex PF350 for the job; I have since had to sell the bass rig; an upright bass player made me an offer I couldn't refuse. He really liked the sound for his Latin Band.                
Sounds amazing no matter what I throw at it musically.                
My only complaint is the lack of a speakon input.                
This cab is totally plug and play user friendly.                
This is a very solid built cab. It's big and heavy but it's high quality all the way.                
This cab sounds better than other ones I've owned that cost twice as much. You can't find a better cab for the money.                
I haven't dealt with them but have friends who have and I have never heard anything but good things about Ampeg's customer support.                
It looks better in person than in pictures. This is a super cool bass cab.                
I got this cab about a month ago now and absolutely love it. Sounds good clean or with distortion and is plenty loud enough as a stand alone cab. Im using a pf500 head and it's loud enough to keep up with two loud guitars and a loud drummer. The lows are deep and thick without getting muddy. The mids are well defined and punchy. The highs sound amazing even with the horn turned off. I have owned a lot of different 4x10 cabs over the years and this one is by far my favorite. For what it's worth the cab looks super classy too, better in person than the pictures. Overall a good value for the money and sounds killer. I'm planning on by a second one down the road to build a monster stack.                
This is an amazing cabinet. I am using it with a Portaflex 350 Head. I use this head since 2 year ago and, it never sounded better. Bass is deeper than deep and, at the same time the high frequency sounds clear and bright as crystal. I think this gear sounds as good as the Ampeg SVT-410HLF, but a very lower price. Because this cabinet was not assembled in the USA, I only hope it last as much as my old cabinet USA made.                
Well after subjecting my new PF 500 to three rehearsals at four hours each and its first club gig last night I think I'm finally ready to write a review. I admit I was somewhat hesitant to buy a Class-D amp at first having read a few negative reviews about fragile input jacks and reliability. But those were in the minority, the PF-500 specs and features were just what I needed, and Ampeg quality and tone are legendary. Also, Ampeg authorized service is close by so I went for it. zZounds made the purchase easy. I used the "play as you pay" option. I submitted the purchase with the first payment about 8pm one evening and got an email with the approval confirmation, payment schedule, and shipment information the next day. It arrived on the day predicted in perfect condition being packed in a box in a box like a set of Russian dolls. Quality and finish were first rate as I would expect from Ampeg. I'm playing a 5-string P-Bass with flat wounds through my PF-500 connected to an SWR Triad cab (15x10xhorn). Now sound quality is subjective to some degree but this amp sounded GREAT to me with Bass, Mid, and Treble set flat. That legendary Ampeg tone is there in spades! So starting there, tweaking these controls has been merely a curiosity so far, but I think you could find a sound for any style of music. I play mostly classic rock, blues, and Motown. By the second set last night I had settled on the following: Compressor at 12 o'clock, input gain at 1 o'clock, Ultra Lo and Hi both disengaged, Bass at 1 o'clock, Mid flat at 12 o'clock, and Treble at 1 o'clock. It was the most sonically satisfying gig I've ever played. I had thundering lows, clear punchy mids, and transparent highs all at the same time. The venue was not huge but I was loud with the output volume set at 1 o'clock. This amp should have plenty of power for any venue size unless it's so large the whole band is mixed through the PA. Now I need a Ampeg log'd T-shirt that says "FAT and PUNCHY"                
The famous Ampeg tone with unmatched portability.  The only knock is volume.  I went from a Fender Rumble 2x10 to the PF 500 and PF210 and there's a noticeable volume boost; just not as noticeable as I was expecting.  I still have to push it to compete with the rest of the band, but I'm hoping another 2x10 cab will get me there.                 
The PF500 will allow you to find your tone and coupled with a PF cab, it's unbelievable to gig with, the ease of transport and self contained storage are insanely awesome.                 
Not a lot of things to figure out here, plug in, adjust your levels and play away.                
The cab solid and looks ready for battle.  Double checked screws and wire connections, all seem good to go.  Casters, which I heard were in issue during release, seem fine.                 
PF 500 and PF210 ~$800, unmatched value.                
NA                
Thing is gorgeous, many compliments from other musicians who have seen or borrowed it. Storing your wires, pedals, tuner, etc right in the cab and flip top for the head will make you smile for sure.                
I love this amp, my band loves this amp, and people that have borrowed it for shows love it.  Again, my only knock is that the standard combo isn't pushing enough power or air at 8ohms and 2x10's.                  
It's got ampeg traits, but not what I was anticipating based on the hype surrounding it.  Sometimes, I think I found the tone (sans-effects), and next time, it's not... quite... right.  I've had it a month and still tinkering.  Admittedly, I ran a Hartke head for about 3 years after playing through a vintage Ampeg regularly.  I liked it, but when I started playing more often decided I needed something with decent wattage and reminisced about the ampeg tone but didn't have a grand to drop on a tube head right now. 
I have plenty of room for being louder - I run it through a 8x10 and it's a force.  I'm pretty sure that I'll have no issues in most places, and DI for the others.                
fantastic set of features - I love the tuner out, the effects loop and the fact that I can blend it with my dry signal - awesome.  using the foot switch (got a 9 dollar ibanez and it works fine) is cool too.                  
I'm still not happy with my settings and how consistently I can dial them in, but everything else is great.                 
Pretty rock-solid enclosure, however I can see how some may gripe about it not being rack-mountable.  I like that it fits in an old 17" laptop backpack perfectly.  The thing is loud as hell so far, but rumor has it that there's a few here and there that croak either at arrival or a bit after use based on my research.  Time will tell.                 
Pretty good bang for the buck so far.                
Haven't had to deal with it yet.                
I'm going to say that my eyes bulged and mouth watered when I heard "solid-state" (lightweight), "ampeg" (mmm, tone), and 500W (loud), but after playing on it some, I kind of shrug when I'm asked about it like "eh - it's alright).                  
I'll be saving my pennies.  Nothing beats the real deal.  I'll probably replace this unit in the next two years, maybe sooner.                  
Wasn't sure what to expect and I was in a bind.  I had a gig the same night I got the PF-500 so it was truly a trial by fire.  Medium sized venue at a full 250 capacity playing through an Ashdown ABM Compact 1x15  I play A homemade Jazz Bass with Aero pickups and P-Bass with LaBella Flats.  I do play mainly 60's and 70's R&B, Soul and Country music.
This amp kills!  Does a very good classic SVT type of sound with ease and with some tweaking of the EQ can get into B-15N territory as well. Probably not the most versatile in terms of covering the entire tone spectrum.  Ultra HiFi modern tone seekers should look elsewhere, this amp has that very defining AMPEG tone all the way.  This is the best product Ampeg has put out in a long time.                  
DI out with a pad, Pre and Post EQ, Speakon connector and 1/4" jacks, tuner out, power amp in, pre amp out, 5 selectable mid Q, FX loop and a mute switch, and 500 watts!!!  What else do you really need in a portable head???  
BONUS -headphone jack with 1/8" stereo in so you can practice or jam along to you iPod                
I give it a 9 for being in to get a very good approximation of most historic Ampeg sounds, it will take the right cab selection and some time spent tweaking.  If you're looking for that crystal clear and clean HiFi sound you shouldn't be looking at Ampeg's anyways because you aren't ever going to get it.                
I'll give it an 8 only because I've only had it a week.  Seems to be built like a tank and don;t anticipate any problems.                
This is the best value going in bass amps right now.  The power and features Ampeg packed into this thing at this price is AMAZING.  I would have to say the consumer finally wins on this deal.                
I haven't had to deal with this but I will give it a 10 beacuse i don;t expect I will have to.                
This thing is pretty much perfect.                
I am extremely happy with this amp.  I would still most likely record with a tube amp but for live playing this is the real deal.  That being said I will definitely give this a shot in the studio.                
i've been using ampeg bass amps for 30 years.....had the B-15 porta-flex, had the V4 with the V4 refridgerator bottom, the SVT with the 4 10" cab and the 1 15" cab...every sound man had made a comment on how nice a it sounded, and i toured the us with that rig.....next was the B200R 220 watts into  15" tube pre-amp sound awesome motown baby rockabilly......had 2 of these babys...had to fix the problem with the gasket of speaker on wrong side..causing bass cabinet rattling..easy fix tho.....and now i got the new pori-flex PF-500, with the PF-210 bottom, and the PF-115 bottom, unbelivable sound, it is full, round, punchy....this is the amp i'll take to the grave.........i only hope i can take it with me to rock and roll heaven so i can jam with Keith Moon...                
it is beautiful....i was surprised at how nice it looks...                
this is all i'll need for the rest of my life...                
I picked this amp up for my wife (although I also play it) and so far it's been great.  We were replacing her old Ampeg BA115 which was lacking a little bit in power (at 100 watts) and also we wanted a head/cab setup for convenience purposes.  Paired with a lightweight 2x10 cab it's super loud and really portable for her (she couldn't really lift the old amp for more than a couple feet) and still has that great ampeg thump.  Also worth noting that we bought a blemished model (because who cares with amps) at 284$ and have no idea where the blemish is!  This is the second time I've bought something repackaged from zzounds with great results.  If you want to save a couple bucks just check the site each day for a week or so and you're sure to come across a resealed or blemish model for an easy discount.                
I upgraded from a cheap Behringer head/cab to the PF500 along with the Ampeg PF410 bass cab & I am absolutely blown away. For the price range, I'm positive that there is no better sounding bass head. I highly recommend this amp to anyone who wants that classic Ampeg sound. You simply cannot do better for the price as well.                
Just got mine today and it has the pure Ampeg tone! I dialed in the compression at about 10 o'clock and it evened it out nicely and I really didn't hear a tone change at all.
I boosted the gain until it started to break up, then backed off a hair and found that sweet spot. I also found that I didn't need to crank the bass knob at all - it has plenty of low end with the bass knob at 12 o'clock.
I was using my stage rig (Avatar 2x10 NEO) but set up in the living room so things might be different on stage, but I doubt I will be disappointed.                
The 5 way mid frequency switch makes it super flexible, and all of the other controls typically found on the SVTs (bass boost, high boost, etc) are very nice and useful. Ampeg doesn't waste time on fancy features that do nothing - this amp has stuff you can use.                 
Piece of cake. It's truly plug and play.                
Seems to be very solid and well made.                
I paid $399. Unreal, it sounds like a $1000 amp.                
NA so far                
Gotta have one if you like light weight and Ampeg tone.                
I was using my stage rig (Avatar 2x10 NEO) but set up in the living room so things might be different on stage, but I doubt I will be dissapointed.
I should report back after a gig or two but I doubt I will change anything.                
I love the Ampeg tone and this delivers. For a couple of years, I've been using the PF350 and I've been very happy with the results, the only problem was that I was having to drive it pretty hard to keep up on stage; I play 70's and 80's glam and hair metal mostly. While the 350 did the job night in and night out, I was concerned about it holding up due to the amount of abuse I was dishing out, so I stepped up to the 500 and I've been quite happy with it. The tone is exactly what I'm after, I get the power I need without having to drive it quite as hard, the features are incredible and the size and price are just what I needed. At my age (52) I'm just not into dragging around huge bass gear anymore - so I drive 2 Eden EX115 cabs with the Ampeg PF500 and it sounds like I've got a big behemoth behind me! If you are looking for power, portability, quality, simplicity and tone, you can't go wrong with Ampeg!                
The PF series amps put out the that Ampeg sound! Many tonal possibilities too with the EQ selector                
5 position mid- EQ selector, On-board Compressor, and sturdy construction                
It's really easy to dial in your sound, not too complicated. There are some good examples of different tonal settings in the owners manual                 
Solid construction                
Great amp for this price! Plenty of power                
I dealt with LOUD/Ampeg on a previous purchase. Communication was decent and while it took a little longer than i hoped, they came through and made things right.                
Love that Ampeg sound!                
I had one, wound up trading it (pF500/PF115)for a American Jazz bass. When I saved up enough money, I bought another one!                
Awesome Amp and Company! I only own Ampeg amps because I want the best! I have a SVT4Pro with the SVT810 cabinet. Best amp ever. I have a BA115 (100 watts) that is also an awesome sounding amp and is much more powerful than you would expect and can handle most small to medium gigs, but some of the gigs we play didn't warrant dragging the refridgerator in and the 100 watter was just not enough, so I can almost sell the other 2 because the PF500 paired with 2 15s can handle any of them AND serve as a practice amp...on wheels!! Love it!                
This amp for the money has a great sound to it.  With modest settings and the selectable mids this is a classic sounding Ampeg head.  I run a 410 cab on it and has plenty of headroom.  The tone is great and needs little adjustments to achieve.                
Most useful is the selectable mid frequency to cut or boost and also the compression adjustment to get incredible sustain out of unit.                  
No problem getting tone out of this champ.  This is classic Ampeg tone.                
Looks great with the retro style knobs and chrome plate on front.                
Well worth the price compared to similar products.                
No need.                
I would just get another one if lost or stolen or just fatigued.                
my old head blew up and I ordered this through zzounds and it arrived before my next gig the following week. this head has a lot of tonal possibility and is very universal as I play all genres of music. It gets a good spank as well as a good motown sound. typical ampeg tone. I used it with an 8 x 10 as well as a 4 x 10 and a 15 and it sounded great especially when driving it into 4 ohms. i pushed it all night and it doesn't even get warm (temperature). Its worth every penny and at 400 bucks it cant be beat.                
I purchased this amp as a back up when my SVT CL was being repaired.  Honestly, this is an awesome little amp!  The tones are great and it's loud!  I use a Fender American Standard Jazz 5 string with an Ampeg Heritage Series SVT-410HLF.  I tried the SVT 7 Pro and I prefer the tone of the Ampeg PF-500 Portaflex.  Absolutely recommended!                
Compression and Ampeg tone!                
Good layout - simple!                
Well built!                
For $400 - WTF!                
On the 2 occasions I have called them, they were very helpful                
Looks retro - I like it!                
I may buy another one as these will sell fast                
This Ampeg Rocks. I had a Genz Benz Shuttle 6.0 and was never satisfied with the sound. I play funk and r and b and I could never get that sound I was looking for. I went to the music store and tried the Ampeg. For 30 years, I've finally found the sound I've been searching for. Wow. It's got that warm, funk tone that I've searched for a life time. Ampeg is the only amp I will ever use again.                
Amp Sounds Great, first ran it into a PortaFlex 1x15 cab with horn, and then added a 4x10 cab along with it. Does what Ampeg is known for and does it well.                
plug in set some sounds and go                
built solid,, no cosmetic  flaws anywhere                
worth every dollar                
I haven't had to call support                
WOW,what a head! got the demo model for $269.00 had in 2 days, no cosmetic damage at all,plugged it up to my cab.what a sound..you can get all the bottom you want,and get the high end out too.planning on buying 1X15 & 4x10 Peavey cabs from ZZounds.bought my 5 string P bass from them also..Great to deal with                
Straight outta the box and on to the stage. Set my tone at sound check. Couldn't be easier. 4 hour show and I have never been more impressed. Classic Ampeg tone, punch and drive. Built in compression makes this a true power house of an amp. Highly recommended.                
Great, lightweight and great sound. At 11 lbs., this is a great amp for the working musician. All the tone controls have a significant effect on your sound. Just dial it in and go.                
I bought a "B" stock PF500, and it is an absolutely amazing amp at a fantastic price! It sounds great, it's easy to use, and it has a wide range of tones. This is my new "go-to" amp. I've been using it more than my B15-N. It's that good!                
I bought this little guy to plug into my Fender Rumble 4x10. I've been playing for almost 25 years and I think this my be the best setup I've had. Nothing too fancy, just a solid, fantastic sounding amp with enough versatility to cover indoor, outdoor, big theater to small club with just a few tweaks. My only complaint is that it's not rackable.                
Awesome tone and plenty of headroom. I play it thru a 4X10 cab and it sounds great! Dial in your preferred tone and boom. I would buy again!                
This is my 1st ampeg..This is an awesome little amp..Sounds great,and plenty loud,rattled everything in the house on half volume(scared the crap out of my dog)Now he runs for the hills everytime I pick up my Bass.                
Very easy to use...If you cant figure it out...well...                
Seems to be very well made..small..aesy to transport                
You wont find anything better at this price                
So far no support needed                
Great amp for the price. I wish I could afford a more expensive but American made amp. Since I cant this one is a great option. Love the extra big and low, the mute button is essential..                 
Initially, it was great. Sound, tone, power etc. Then it would start to cut out at times. I had to turn the compression all the way off to alleviate the problem. Then, in the middle of show, it was gone completely. The fault light came on and that was it. Read the manual on what to do and that did not help. Ampeg's website directed me to their local authorized service center which is a garage and basement in the middle of a residential subdivision in the suburbs of Chicago. Not very impressive  .  After about 10 days, when originally I was told 5-7 days I was told Ampeg would just replace it and it was on its way. Another week, nothing. Called service center, I was told Ampeg was out of stock and would send Bstock. Waited. No Bstock. Then I was told Astock was available. Received the Astock and dead on arrival. Extremely disappointed. .                 
500 watts of Ampeg tone in an 11 lb. package.. what else needs to be said.. i use this head with an Eden 4x10XLT 4ohm 700wt cab.  It pushes it plenty hard and the tone i get through my yamaha bass and this set up is simply awesome.. no other pedals of any kind needed                
it has everything you need in a head.                
worth every penny.. purchased it mothers day weekend at local guitar center for 349.. extatic!!!                
Awesome piece. Make sure you place it in a rack. The functionality of the P F 500 are great, but like most class D product the jacks are suspect to loosen inside, even the speakon jack                
Depending on the venue, I use the PF500 with a variety of cabinets.....Ampeg 4-10, twin Mojo Sonic single 10"s, Carvin 4-10, Peavey 1-15....and thanks to the tonal flexibility offered by the PF500....they all sound good!  Sufficient power and great features wrapped up in one nice compact unit!                
While it isn't quite as "tube-y" as I had hoped, this thing is a tone monster, and sounds amazing for an all-state head.  You can get amazingly B-15 tones from it, and still get SVT sizzle with just the twist of a knob.  Don't be afraid to spin knobs on this, either, you really can't get a bad sound from it.                
I'd like to see a variable line-out control, rather than a simple full/-40 pad, and I would prefer that you could play the line in through the speaker cab instead of just through headphones.  Other than that, it really has everything I need.                
There are only a few knobs, so it's pretty simple to use, the owner's manual is complete and clear.                
It's an Ampeg.  Need I say more?                
Somewhere between a good value and downright inexpensive.                
I haven't had to use it, but I hear from friends that there customer service is excellent.                
It's much better in person than in photos.                
There is a good chance I'll never need another amp.                
Heard great things about ampeg, so I was excited to get one.  I am very disappointed with the output of this amp.  My 2 guitar players blow me away.  Every show we play people tell me they can't hear me.  It craps out on me quite often for no reason that I, or anyone else can determine.  I've tried every setting on it and it still does it.  The people where I bought it are at a loss.  I've tried contacting ampeg for assistance, but they keep telling me I must be doing something wrong.  I've been playing bass for over 30 years and have owned several different heads. I've never had this problem before and based on this,  I will never buy another ampeg product.                
The sound is pure Ampeg.  Which one?  It depends on how you set it.  I've been able to get a really excellent B-15 emulation and an outstanding SVT emulation from it with a simple tweak of the EQ settings (and gain).  It isn't as "tubey" as the 7-Pro or other models with tubes, obviously, but it is an exceptional resemblance.  The DI is pretty hot, but run the -40dB pad, post EQ, and set the mixer for microphone, and it works fine.  This thing is LOUD, too (pun intended).                
I'd like to see an attenuator control on the DI.  Wish it had a tube pre-amp, but for the money, I can't complain.                
Great sound is almost guaranteed, as long as you like Ampeg's sound.  It really does sound like an Ampeg.                
Seems really well made, feels sturdy enough.  I've gigged this a few times in the last month that I've had it, and taken it out to rehearsals twice a week.  It is light and easy to transport (hint - get an inexpensive laptop bag, it fits perfectly, and most have pockets for the cables).  It has held up well so far, and I have no doubt it will continue to do so.                
Great bang for the buck.                
Haven't had any support issues with this one, but whenever I've dealt with Ampeg, they've been phenomenal.                
It isn't an SVT or B-15, so it is certainly lacking that sex appeal.  However, other than other bass players, who notices what amp you're using?  Nobody.  They look at your speaker cab, but not the amp.                
This is a great little amp. Great low end and crisp mids and highs. I originally purchased the Line 6 HD400 but there was just too much modeling which is good if you like that kind of variety in an amp head. The PF500 is simple in design and function and cuts through all the clutter to deliver fantastic sounds through my GK 410MBX. If you are on a budget, and even if you are not, I would recommend the Ampeg PF500.                
This amp feels solid and has great tone but there is no way this thing pushes the 500 watts it says it does. Prior to owning this amp I used a Hartke LH500 with an ampeg 410hlf and I never turned the volume past 2-3 at shows, at practice, in a 4 piece it did fine. Now with this Ampeg Pf-500 (same cab) and in a 3 piece I find myself at 10 and turning the gain up to be heard through the drums. Very disappointed, I wish they lived up to there reputation.                
The moment I plugged my '76 Fender P-Bass into the PF-500, the cooling fan wouldn't start, the fault light turned on, and no sound came out.Seller sent me 2 replacements, Ampeg sent me another, all with the same problem.Great service from seller and Ampeg, they were very helpful, but I think the PF-500 has a very serious design flaw.                
I got this amp delivered by Musicians Friend, and after opening the box and testing it out, I immediately boxed it back up and sent it back. Returned for a full refund. 
This amp has no tone, very bland sounding, and the 300 watts into 8 ohms seemed alot less. 
Was disappointed in this product by Ampeg. Save yourself the headache and buy a used amp that has some tone and power to it.                
For the price you definitely cannot beat the value. There are no extraneous knobs or buttons that clutter other amps. If you like the Ampeg sound, then you are in for a treat. I have not been playing bass for too long but I have been a musician for the better part of my life and I know music. I have tried other amps to include a modeling amp and they were just too cumbersome to operate. Clean lines, crisp tones and excellent pricing make this amp a value you should not pass up! I cannot rate manufacturer support as I have not needed them to date.                
warm to solo ,i can play chords with clarity for days...                
compressor is very nice  and works                 
very easy to dial in i have used this head with ,SWR, AMPEG, EDEN AND IT COMMANDS WHAT IT WANTS ,slight learning as you learn the how to's when you travel from stage to stage pack light ,i just bring my head and my bass they have a speaker on sight the amp brings out the best in the speakers too..                
great so far                
good buy ,good price                
never had to use it                
yes  , THE wow factor ! coming from GK  bottom with brilliance for days                 
i have been playing for quite a few years and have tried and played through  may amp's , i was really hesitant on getting this as i know the rep on the AMPEG and i like bottom ,mid and smack in your face ,punch to the chest sound and i thought that ampeg had a muddy ,warm, humbuck, no definition ect. sound until...... i was just going to get this play it at a concert test and send back the head , in my last three shows i played this from a fender jazz active to a IBANEZ soundgear  605 hummmm.... now i cant get rid of it and don't want to ,one of the sound  engineers front of the house and musicians i play with was like this amp was cutting through and i play with these musicians for years ,i am truly amazed and would love to be a ampeg spokesmen  ,i am for real get his head ,versatility ,bottom,mid and spank its all here ,,1 session i was was not playing loud but i had my bottom on 4 ,and watched the 8/10's bust up this top can move some air ,i hear ,and i hear yeah but  ,yeah  but ,just get it you wont regret it  nice investment we will see longevity  time will tell .....                
I think this is an outstanding value. I owned the PF-500 which I also bought from Zzounds and I loved the tone but it always seemed to lack headroom to me. Well thankfully Ampeg introduced the PF-800! 
Dont be skeptical, this amp is one of the best amps Ampeg makes. The price is perfect. The looks are stunning with the sweet purple power light. I would buy one again tomorrow if I needed it.                 
before this I had a PF350 and found a decent sound for a 2x10 speaker cabinet. moved to the states and needed that Ampeg Fridge. I dint wanted to have a 80lbs tube amp to match it and jump to my mind the PF I called Ampeg asking if this set up will match up and it was fine! When the amp arrived (pretty quick) I dialed a good sound a huge headroom from a 12lbs amp and still have ampeg classic tone all over!                
Light.powerful, great tone..first gig I played with this amp made the usually grumpy front man smile all night. If this amp blew up tomorrow I'd but the same amp again.                
I have gigged with my beloved PF500 for 4 years. I did have some shutdown problems a week ago (heat and low voltage) and wanted just a bit "more."First gig with the PF800. Wow....just Wow! It picked up where the PF500 left off. More headroom, but all the features I know and love. I gigged with an SVT in the mid 70's through early 80's. I would not trade this amp for my old SVT head. This does everything my SVT did, and does it better. I bought the PF500 after my GK1001RB died. I loved the Ampeg from the first use, where the GK was just a utility head for me. It got the job done, but I never cared for the sound or response. The Ampeg was like having an additional "instrument." Thank you Ampeg. I look forward to see what Yamaha develops with the Ampeg line. 56                
Bought this amp after testing driving a friends 500 at a gig. I push amps fairly hard and the 500 went into shut down mode twice because of the stress. The 800 is everything I need. Having said that, I can attest to the amps finicky nature sometimes.  When using a jazz bass and digging in deep with plenty of high end snarl , the amp when into shut down mode as well.  I understand I was pushing a bit much. But since that day and after a few EQ tweaks the amp has not blinked.  I use it in 2 original bands and a cover band. It fits in a briefcase style case and goes everywhere.. Well worth the money. Every feature is as advertised...loved that i got it at ZZounds                 
I wanted to review this amp after my first gig with it because of how much I LOVED it! I figured id wait a few months just to test its worthiness. Its been played every friday and saturday night for about 4 hours a night for the past 6 months and have had ZERO issues.. Amp turns right on! I use the preamp send into the left side of my in-ear monitor system and sounds killer! Am pushing the amp through a Ampeg SVT CL 8x10 and cant see spending any money on a new amp anytime soon. My only gripe at first was a set of rackears seem to be impossible to find.. although it would be easy to make a set of your own ears.. the universal rack trays work great, just take the screws out from the rubber feet of the amp and attach to the universal tray! .                
Excellent tone. Power - I'm unimpressed.
Never had any bass head near 800 watts, so I was very careful to turn up the volume on first use. (was scared it would jump out at me!) Not the case with this amp. I gets loud upward above 7 near 8.                 
I received the Amp and two speaker cabinets ahead of time in good condition from zZounds. I connected the speaker cabinets and amplifier and tried to adjust the EQ but could not get rid of a distracting distortion coming thru the proflex head. I tried several different speakers and finally tried another amplifier with these speakers to determine that the amp was the source of the weird sound. Knowing that Ampeg is a top of the line quality product, I believe this was a rare case of receiving a slightly defective product. I contacted zZounds to explain the problem. zZounds immediately issued a RMA for me to return the amp head no questions. In my case, I decided to purchase another amplifier locally so I could actually hear it before I hooked it up to the speakers, Overall, because of the timely and understanding customer service, I gave them a high rating for this purchase. I believe these guys care about working musicians and stand behind everything they sell. The speakers sound amazing with my new Ampeg head. Ampeg is still the best product for serious bass players.                
This stack is amazing. Used it first time at a gig 2 days after receiving this monster. We blew out a sub so they were relying on my new Ampeg  to cover without going in the mix. Not a problem. This thing pumped the building. The features on this amp stack are all you will ever need. EQing, compression and booste buttons are easy to figure out and really enhance a good tight sound. This system is built for the long haul, although I highly recommend the covers to protect the handsome look of the speakers. I haven't needed support yet, although I've had smaller Ampeg amps in the past and never needed support. The sound blew everyone in the band away due to not being in the mix. It covered the room nicely. If you have a five string, it will handle that Low B with a vengeance. Rumbled the rafters. I paid a great price for what I got, and using zZounds just makes it easy to pay as you pay. I've bought $10K in musical equipment and never had a problem with payment plans or ordering problems. Received the unit 2 days after the order, with free shipping.                
Great amp and cabinets. The 15" cabinet gives you nice low end that a 15" speaker can but yet it is still tight and clean. The 4-10 cabinet with the horn covers frequencies from low to up high. It gives you the rapid transient the 10s can along with the crisp hi's. It is very responsive and tight as well. The cabinet matches perfectly to the 15" cabinet. The 800 watt head gives you plenty of headroom. The eq is great and I like the onboard compressor with a little dialed in. It really sweetens the sound. Used the rig for the first time last week end and was absolutely blown away with it. My fellow band members all complimented on how good it sounded. Plus it is easy to move around, not a back breaker.Great rig Ampeg.                
This is a very nice rig! I bout the head with two cabinets. One is the 4x10 cabinet. Which is a monster! Surprisingly huge on the bottom end. My favorite though, is the 1x15. It does so much for my needs alone. I use both cabinets though. The 15 by me, and the 4x10's by the drummer. This works out great. Stacked together? Not sure how that sounds.. Haven't tried that out yet. These cabinets are both light weight for wht they do. The whole rig is easy to move.  I am very satisfied with the quality, the price i paid for the rig, and for the great ecperience with zZounds. The only thing remotely to complain about, was that one cabinet came in two whole days after the first one did. No big deal.. On to my next transaction with these guys. I am happy to be doing business with you guys.                
Bought this Stack after playing with it in my local Guitar Center and I am not disappointed in the least.  This thing has a big booming sound that is very clean and with plenty of headroom to spare and I have only played it through the 4 X 10.  I will be hooking up the entire package tomorrow to hear how it sounds.  
The ZZounds staff is incrediably patient and friendly and most importantly helpful.  They were able to arrange for FedEX to hold this at my local facility to keep everything safe.  Looking forward to the first performance with this! 
This is a plug and play and it took no time at all to dial in a sound I like.                 
Buying the Ampeg Portaflex PF800 Bass Amp Stack  was the best decision I made musically, and going with zZounds was the best decision I made professionally.
You cannot dispute the iconic sound of Ampeg for bass.                
Awesome bass rig. Easy to dial in "Your Sound"...This rig just kicks butt. zZounds was great! Will definitely be ordering more stuff...                
FedEx dropped it off this morning, thrilled. Ampeg has never let me down. If you know the brand, you don't need my review to know what it does for your sound. Those cabs are nice and light ( nothing like my 810's ) well built, punchy, crisp, warm like butter, cuts thru the mix...what else is there? OH...they look great. Doesn't take much to get the sound you want.                
Unbelieveable deal! This is the best option I found in a bass set-up and the best company to deal with. 
I Finally own Ampeg 
I am Proud to have the PF-800/115 Portaflex and am looking forward to gigging out with it.
Thank You, zZounds for the Excellent Payment Plan option.                
I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife, who had an old head and 210 that weighed about a million pounds. She prefers a 115 (has it with another amp) and the tone shaping on this is fantastic! Plus, it's easy for me to get it up and down the basement steps for gigs ... OK, I bought it for ME ...                
Like I said, Ampeg tone, good mid controls. As shipped it will push 450w. I have ran this Half Stack with an added PF210 to hear it at 800w and it was awesome. Great punch sustained lows. I personally intend to purchase the 210 some. Still, at 450w it has good headroom.                
I like that the head Mounts to the lid of the cabinet. The fasteners are well built and sturdy. There is a heavy duty Velcro strap secured to the inside of the cab. It will be strapping down your caster wheels in an Ampeg pouch when you purchase. I have been using the Velcro to strap Down my Jenson DI. It ships with a 16 gauge speaker cable, i suggest replacing it with a 14 gauge speakon cable.                
I dont think I can answer this question. For me, yeah its super easy. But i have good amount of common sense and better amount of knowledge concerning my Gear. If you run a high impedance intrument cable from your amp to your cab instead of a speaker cable, then I cant comment on ease of use.                  
So Far, everything is looking secure and sturdy, well built. I have had Ampegs in the past the the knobs and dials start getting loose after a year... we will see.                
Oh yeah                
Haven't dealt with them, but i have experience with zZounds Support and they have always been supper Helpful.                
The material the cab is wrapped with has nice pattern to it the way it reflects light. I like the Light on the front of the head. I have had a few people tell me it looks as sharp as it sounds.                
I have always loved the tone of Ampeg systems, and the PF800 / PF115HE Half Stack did not disappoint. Plenty of Options in the Mid-range frequencies allow me to cut out the muddiness and add a little growl, helping my basslines cut through the mix. 
Have used this new rig for funk/rock and country/western gigs. The PF115HE sounded great after being broken-in for a few hrs. The bass player in the funk band I play guitar in uses an Ampeg SVT PRO 4 so he was the first to give the head a good test. It passed with flying colors. Second gig was me playing bass in a country/western band. The Portaflex rig performed beautifully with no hiccups with that great Ampeg sound. Well done and I'm a happy camper. I can't comment on customer support as there have been no issues to report.                 
I bought this amp over a year ago i have gig with it so many times is light and has plenty of power with the 800 watts. My brother gig with it with a band that had 3 guitar players one keyboard Drums and 4 singers and my brother were all the way in the back with a 6 string ibanez and the amp. Everyone was amazed on how you can hear the bass loud clear crisp punchy. This was when i said i made the right choice. Thanks Amoeg for your quality and thanks zZounds for making it possible for me.                
This product is extremely worth the buy!If a bassist need that thump and bump,THIS IS IT!Smooth,clean tone,deep,high mids,everything you could want in tone hands down!                
I have a full stack Ashdown EVO 500 and 2 4/10 cabs . Great for gigs but too much trouble for one guy for grab and go sessions.  I did lots of research on combos and this was my choice for Blues and Classic Rock.  It sits well in the mix and has that classic Ampeg tone. Fat, Round and Bassy and you can dial in a little grit if you like.  The onboard Compressor is good and my Darkglass on my Pedal Board is not needed.  The cab Construction is top notch and the Black Diamond Tolex gives it a nice old school touch.  It being a Portaflex you can mount the amp to the lid and safely transport it to and fro.  Great tone and as is with one cab you got 400 watts @ 8 ohms.  Ampeg Technical Support has been top notch replying to several questions I had pre and post purchase.                
I've always used Fender and Peavey Amps. When I bought this amp I did so wanting to down size. First gig everyone on the bandstand was blown away. Tone and power are there. I am more than pleased with my amp.                
A) Great amp. Tone Controls have a very satisfactory range. Plus everything you need for gigging and recording. B) zZounds shipped the thing SO FAST. Ordered it Thursday night. Saturday morning checked the tracking status, it was already on a truck a few towns over. C) Love The Flip Top. D) Lightweight for an amp this good. Also the Castors. Super convenient. E) Pricey. I would never have bought this amp if it weren't for the Pay as you Play deal. I'm spending extra money in the long run to have a good amp now, rather than save up cash for the rest of the year.                
Got this baby along with the PN115-HLF and it's a wonderful sounding combination paired with my SVT-7 PRO. All the bottom and volume one could ask for when playing the local club scene. It presents itself with warmth and depth. Solid construction throughout. Eminence speakers and high frequency horn level control adjust easily to your desired sound. With all the above attributes considered and the relative "lightness" ... the 115 checks in at 59 lbs and the 410 at 64 lbs ... this is THE RIG your ears, audience, band mates and your precious back will cherish for years and years. Hey, it's AMPEG. This stuff speaks for itself.                
Using just as a D.I., your sound is clean and clear with no degradation of tone.  When you engage the amp modeling side, you can dial in everything from a fat, chunky Motown B15 warmth (dial in a little scrambler to create the tube break-up), or dial in the clean and bright sounds that lend an ear to a Marcus Milleresk tone.  The scrambler side goes from a subtle buzz of tubes breaking up to the full on fuzz of Geezer Butler doing the bass intro of N.I.B.                
I found the aux plugs fascinating.  You can plug your iPhone direct into the pedal and play along with songs you are working on, a feature on the bulky and expensive multi effects processor.  Match that with the headphones jack, and you have the ultimate in practice machines.                  
This D.I. is well labeled, easy to read, and very intuitive.  If you can operate the most basic amp plate, this will be a breeze.  It will operate on batteries (9V).  I would recommend getting a 9V power cable with plug.  It will chew up a regular battery in 4 hrs. of use.                
This pedal is solid and sturdy.  Switches have great snap.  The pedal could use a guard, or barrier for the knobs.  I could see where you might accidentally bump one during the excitement of a gig.                
For the features, tone, adaptability to any board, style, environment I don't know of anything close to this pedal.  Quality from start to finish.  Even if you don't think you need a D.I. or a pedal...you need this.                
It's Ampeg, They have come a long way from 6 years ago, when they didn't care about their customer, but the value of their name.  The R&D department nailed it with this D.I.  I called them, just to see, and they were very helpful.  As far as Zzounds, they are awesome.  No complaints on either front.                
Completely blown away.  My band mates were stunned, and understood my elation.  I don't know that I have ever been this satisfied with any other piece of gear.  And that's making a statement, as I love all my equipment.                
I needed a D.I. box, but I wanted something with character.  It takes me years of research to buy something, I'm careful with my investments.  When these hit NAMM this year, they created such a buzz and caught my attention.  I am a professional, and have friends that are very in demand players.  After consulting with them, as they had hands on with the Scrambler D.I., I decided to go ahead and pull the trigger.  Was I ever glad.  The features are insane, the sound and functionality left me giddy.  Seriously, one of the best investments ever.                
Excellent product worth every penny and more. I'm getting some beautiful sounds from it. Ill be using this for many yrs.If you order this, be sure to get the 9 volt wall adapter. Batteries don't last long.                
I ordered this just for practicing with headphones. I've tried those smaller pocket sized headphone amps, but those aren't all that great. I couldn't really even get a good tone out of my bass amp's headphone output. It was ok, but not really good. The SCR-DI sounds great, and I got a pair of 32 ohm headphones to get enough volume. (My 60 ohm headphones weren't loud enough on the bass amp...). I also ordered the Boss PSA-120S adapter, after reading the other reviews here. No horrible noises at all, apparently a low battery is the cause of that. I highly recommend getting an adapter! The volume control for the aux input is a nice touch, something most headphone amps (and bass amps) don't have. I can turn it down quicker without clicking things on the computer to lower the line-out volume. I'm not a big fan of effects, and don't really use the Scrambler much, but it gives some decent distortion with the Blend knob turned way down. As of yet, I don't need the DI output, but it's there if I ever join a band. I haven't used it, so no idea how it sounds. I sometimes plug the Line Out into the effect return on my Fender Rumble 100, gives me a new amp! It's great during the day when I can make noise. The only negative, and a minor one maybe, is the internal jumper to set it for active or passive bass. I have one of each, so I'm putting together an attenuator for the active bass, so I don't have to open up the SCR-DI and move the jumper. An external switch would have been a good thing to have. Other than that, I love this thing, sounds great, even with headphones.                
The pedal has a buffered sound. When not using the preamp, you'll need to use another pedal to boost volume levels. That said, I love the tone stack. The SVT sound really comes through. I really like the way my bass sounds through it. Can't really say if the tone stack "colors" the bass tone. 
For my style and my current bass set up in praise and worship (Yamaha TRBX305 with Aguilar Super Doubles and a Seymour Duncan STC-3P), I begin with my EQ set to noon. If I'm using a lot of finger style that day, I'll boost the mids to about 1 or 2 o clock, and sometimes the bass to about 1 o clock. For slap and funk tones, I like to set the bass and treble to 1 o clock. and mids at noon.                 
I love that I can use it as a practice amp. We went through some struggles recently and had to get rid of a fender halfstack and found myself with nothing to practice with. This pedal made practice possible. I'm not really a fan of the overdrive circuit, and currently have a love/hate relationship with it. 
The ultra-hi and lo settings are interesting. I don't use the ultra hi boost, but the ultra low I'll use with overdrive to help make up for any bottom end I lose. Sometimes I'll use it too if I need thick bass for something slow but epic.
My only wish is that I could have slightly better EQ controls, specifically with the mids, maybe a parametric sweep, or even a switch with preset frequencies.                 
Very easy to use. Beware, if you put a battery into it, it will buffer your signal even if it's off. 
I really like that I can unscrew the back pack without the use of tools of any kinds. The rubber pads underneath are designed to also function as thumb screws, very easy to take off and replace, which makes replacing batteries on the fly a very simple task.                
The pedal feels heavy and tough, but I cannot yet speak on it's reliability although it hasn't failed yet.                
It's expensive but worth it.                
No real wow factor. It is a nice solid pedal but nothing crazy or particularly special about it.                
I love this pedal. My purpose for purchasing this pedal was to improve my bass tone. I figured the best way was to look for something I could use to split my signal between the stage amp and the house system at my church. I'm not a fan of the stage rig we use, so this pedal allows me to bypass the rig. The best part was the added unexpected bonus of total ground noise elimination! For some reason, utilizing the XLR output from the amp head to the house resulted in ungodly amounts of noise. I now get a cleaner signal to the house and can better control my volume (the stage rig is very old and has sensitive volume controls).                
I recently picked up an inexpensive Bugera rig for live gigs, which was great "oomf" for the price, but it didn't quite have the tone or character I wanted. Very flat sound, but affordable!
Enter the SCR-DI! I wanted something with some crunch built in, that also had DI out. But the headphone out and AUX in on this definitely peaked my interest, as its always nice to have after-hour practice options.
I plugged it into my head, and as soon as I switched it on I was in tone heaven. Even with the EQ settings all set flat, this box gave my bass tone that color and chunk I was looking for. Then of course with the Ultra Hi/Lo settings there's even more flexibility on how round, snappy, or smooth you want. The scrambler sounds great. I prefer the drive and blend both set to 12-o'clock, just to give some crunch on the top end, that gets more dirty the harder you play. Cranked all the way is almost fuzz territory.
The paint job makes it look plastic but it's a rugged all metal chassis so I'm sure this'll be part of my rig for a while. Overall I'm super pleased with this. Highly recommended if you're in need of a DI box or just looking for an all-in-one solution to make your rig sound more Ampeg-ish.                
This pedal makes my bass explode with awesome. It can melt face and make babies. The tones are very "tube driven" and the low and high boost really help out the passive pickups to give a serious thump. The Scrambler is great and the blend option helps out a lot.
There is the option of buying the preamp pedal and the scambler pedal separately at the same price, that's what i would recommend for pedalboards, way more options.                
This pre amp has really helped me shape a tone that I didn't know was available at this price. Its very fat and bright. The overdrive is also a keeper. The D.I. is also a dream for recording my exact sound. Built like a brick, (" I bet I could throw this over them mountains...")                
Right now I use it for practicing. I plug my guitar into my Hot Rod Plexi and run that through my Boss EQ and Reverb pedel. I plug my ipod into the aux in, then plug in my headphones and away I go...Private Practice ! Love It !!!                
The tones you can dial in on this pedal are amazing and very versatile.                
The aux in and headphone amp make this a must have for practice. The ultra low and ultra high switches add a buttery depth to the sound. The Scrambler circuit does not sound great and is very difficult to dial in.                
It is easy to dial in the EQ but dialing in the Scrambler circuit takes patience and perseverance.                
I am returning my second pedal for the same weird high pitched scream. Unusable because the scream is so loud and high pitched it makes you rip off headphones, and if playing through the front of house the sound engineer will mute you. Both pedals were barely used and very well cared for.                
This pedal would be worth the money twice over for the sounds it produces if it didn't have serious quality issues in the electrical circuit.                
I have not dealt with Ampeg because I have not owned it long enough to require dealing with them over dealing with the dealer.                
10 out of 10 for appeal. This product appears professionally built and designed. The knobs are smooth, the case is tough aluminum. The switches appear to be high quality. The purple LED is awesome and the EQ sounds amazing.                
The sound you can get from this pedal is amazing. It sounds just like playing through an Ampeg amp. However, the scrambler is very difficult to dial in and seems counterintuitive. The worst part about this pedal is the quality. I am on my second pedal after returning the first, and am having the same issue with this pedal. After a couple of minutes of playing through the pedal with the EQ on or off it shoots a building high pitch scream. Does not matter if using headphones or line out or XLR out. It sounds like a capacitor overloading or something to that effect. I am not willing to date more time on this pedal, which is a real bummer because of the amazing sounds you use can get out of it.                
Nice and loud. Kinda old school but nice. The only problem is my ERA control did not work                
ERA control not working                
Easy just take some time dialing it in                
Real nice pedal. I just wished it worked correctly                
If it worked as advertised it would be worth every penny. At least I think so from the sound examples on YouTube                
I didn't contact them                
It looks nice and has a nice sound that my other pedals don't do. So it wowed me so what                
I never had the ability to try this pedal so I watched every YouTube video I could and read every review that I found. The pedal hissed a lot even when tried 2 different power supplies. I could get pass that but the ERA control everyone was raving about didn't do anything to change the tone like in the YouTube vids. So I had was EQ and an overdrive sound if I cranked up the drive control. I think that this may be a defective unit but if it isn't it's not for me. I like the sound of the pedal. It has an old school type vibe and its loud but I need more tone shaping that the ERA control is suppose to provide. I will be returning this unit                
I received my first SCR-DI on a Thursday. Used it that night and loved. I went to use it Saturday night and all it would do is scream! It was like a loud capacitor discharge. I changed cables, basses, and everything I could think of and could not stop it. I called ZZOUNDS and exchanged it for another one. This one did the same thing right out of the box. I wished it had been OK. I really enjoyed using it the first night. ZZounds was GREAT dealing with it!                
It's what I expect from Ampeg! Quality, and great features. I was originally going to buy a mixer to blend my bass and iphone/pc for practice. I was digging around for something that foots the bill when I found this item! I ordered it quickly (and got it quickly). 
From a build standpoint, this this is heavy (read: rugged). The pots all feel smooth and the footswitches are solid. The sound is exactly what you expect from a company that specializing in a niche market. 
COMPLAINT: I did not know that AMPEG offers the power adapter (model # 2045758-00 for U.S.), and so I ordered a Boss PSA-120S, which was recommended by another user. The Boss works fine, but being a purist, I wish I had know earlier that I could order one by Ampeg. REALLY, it should not be an issue. 
All in all, great product!
I am GOING to recommend this product!                 
I was looking to buy several devises to mix signal and bass into headphones. This was a 'one size fits all' device for me. 
The sound is pure and clear. The thing is built like a tank. 
This is an AMPEG DI box/processor. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of other brands, but if you after that AMPEG tone, here you go!
I bought a Eden RS410 to replace my svt15e. I put them side by side and tested them. I found the Ampeg 15 much much clearer than the RS410 by Eden. The Ampeg reproduced my basses sounds like the fret board the squeaking of the strings etc. I asked my wife to listen and she was amazed also. You can,t go wrong with the Ampeg SVT15E.                
Good                
Good                
Work of art                
A steal                
Owned 3 Years no problems                
I like tolex covering better than carpet. Best looking Cab available                
Very good                
I fell in love last night!!! I play bass in a country/classic rock band. I had been talked into other amps/cabs in the past. This time I was determined to get an Ampeg cabinet. I already own a SVT6 and a SVT3 amp. The SVT15 matches up with the amps perfectly! From the first song of the night I knew I had the "perfect" rig! WOW!!! I have finally found the sound I have been searching for. Big fat bottom end and mid/high end combo to die for.                 
The neutrik connection is a must for high power connections.                
Plug it in, adjust your tone to get the sound you want... enjoy!                
Solid construction, very dependable. It's an Ampeg... need I say more?                
As I said, I had been talked into other brands in the past... Hartke was the last. I'll take the Ampeg any day. Great value!!!                
I just got it, but ZZounds has been great!                
Great classic Ampeg look, solid construction, And that sound... I should have bought this years ago!!!                
It's a keeper. If and when I buy another cab, it will be another Ampeg. No doubt about it. It is light enough to carry anywhere(72lbs). I can't ever see being without this rig!                
This cab gets "nasty dirty" in a good way. I use 2 of them with a br2 head....... FREAKIN ROCKS                  
The 9 band is great, but being able to turn it off is cool as well.
You will have a good tone in under 5 minutes of getting it out of the box.                
This thing is built! You can feel it. Heavy case, and all the knobs, and faders are smooth as glass.                   
For the price you cant beat it. I'v been playing for over 30 years now. I have owned just about anything you can think of. I would have thought Ampeg could have sold this head for alot more than the asking price.                  
never used                 
It has this industrial look going on..                 
I will use this head for a long long time. I cantsee myself looking for anything else. Its perfect for what I am doing.                
Deep, Fat, Wet it's got it all. Ampeg sound is amazing                
It's a cab                
Built like a brick sh*thouse                
Quality for the value is amazing                
Not needed it but I've heard its great                
AMPEG QUALITY AMPEG SOUND                
AMAZING It sounds great for practice and Gigs                
I'd been using 1x12 cabs that had horns in them.  However the horns put out such a hiss, I'd always just dialed them to zero, which resulted in a stuffy, deadened sound.  Finally decided to switch to 2x10's with no horns and boy, do I ever love this speaker!  Lightweight, small, not ported, no horns... and sounds amazing!  Very full-spectrum sound.  
I am not using the matching head, I am using a TC Electronic BH250 which is a very good match.
I play an Ibanez bass that has bass, treble, and mid controls with a sweepable mid frequency, so I can pretty much dial in any sound I want... and this baby plays them ALL just right!  I can go deep, low and boomy, or I can dial it up and get that nice, tight 2x10 sound.  This cab does it all!
I have also turned it WAY up and MAN does this thing crank out the dB's!! whoever said it wasn't loud enough... maybe get yer ears checked?  I mean yeah, it's not for stadiums, but I'm thinking this think could manage a small club on it's own...
Very, very happy with my purchase. Probably going to buy a matching one so I can double-up if I really want a huge sound!  But right now, just this cab and my BH250 fills out my basement music studio and can keep up with drums and a whole band situation no problem.
Not the sexiest bit of kit, the retro silver thing is OK but I might have preferred something else, but I guess they gotta stick with the retro SVT look...
It's an Ampeg.  I run it throught the Micro amp.  I own the SVT 3 Pro and 810 cabs and also the 210 and Micro amp.  You can own the sound for $600 rather than $2200.  I use both all the time.  Both applications live and studio.  Recording with the Micro is perfect.                
Features great tone!                
Plug and play.                
No problems with any of my Ampeg stuff.                
You get what you pay for.  In the micro case...you actually get a little more.                
Loud Technologies....Have to rate them tops because I've only contacted them for replacement parts and received help.                
I am buying a second cab, so there you go.  Maybe it won't do your tour with it but for smaller live applications, recording and for practice, you need one too!
Buy it, if you want the Ampeg tone in a small package.                
The sound is rich and full. Amazing for a small portable cabinet.                
I'm using it with my Ampeg SVT Pro 3 head. The head is rated at 450 watts at 4 ohms or 275 watts at 8 ohms. If you daisy chain two of these speaker cabinets together the ohms drop to 4 and is capable of 400 watts max handling power. It's nice to be able to split the speaker placement locations....that gives an even fullness with a cabinet on both sides of the stage.                
The cabinet sounded good right out of the box and will sound better when the speakers are broken in a little more.....no rattles....just a good low end presence.                
Well made cabinet (Birch Plywood) and light (26 lbs)....this back of mine appreciates that.                
At $299/cabinet Ampeg is having a hard time keeping supplies in stock. The economy may be a bit down, but the demand for this cabinet is high.                
Haven't had any issues at all.                
Sometimes Good Things come in small packages.                
I'll stay with Ampeg for Bass products....why switch when you've found a good product.                
I purchased one of these Cabs last October to pair with my Ampeg PF-500 head.  The cab produces great sounds, although to my ears they tend to be a little "dark" and not too boomy.  Obviously a 210 tends to be more punchy, and recently I added a second Cab and what a difference!  It does seem to be a little underpowered IMO, but the Head I run at full capacity is 500 watts, and these Cabs when paired together can handle a 400 watt load.  I don't push them too hard, but with two cabs the highs tend to be brighter and crisper, the midrange is very present, a very "mid" voiced Cab-and as mentioned the low(s) are there (but don't get this Cab thinking it's bringing down the house!).  I love the cosmetics, and the facts each cab is only 25lbs!!!  Ampeg made another solid product (I heard the tolex wears off over time, but I tend to keep my cabs stationary in a jam room).                  
I run a GK800RB head, I have a brand new 15" Peavey Black Widow in a Carvin RL115 cab, that itself was a massive improvement, but I bought the Ampeg SVT210 to get my highs and a nice punch. OMG! First of all, these guys at zzsounds were amazingly easy to deal with, I ordered the cab late Monday, it was shipped Tuesday, I received it Wednesday! with the 4 payment option. that itself was incredible, I opened it up, set it up with my head and 15, turned it on and was totally blown away by the sound, what a bad-ass, ballsy sound!!!! Every review I read about this cab, not only from this site, but other companies too, is true, this cabinet kicks ass! Period!                 
This thing is great, small and light and it sounds like a mini 810. can't beat it for $300.                
This speaker cab sounds good, but it is far to quiet for anything other than playing in your living room, unless you plan to mic it all the time.  It also cost me $66.20 to return it.                
This cab sounds great. The perfect compromise between 15s and 10s.  I love it.
zZounds shipped fast and it arrived with zero issues!  It could only be better if I had two of them!                
The sound is awesome until you put some real power to them then they blow apart the brace breaks off and they rattle like crazy I returned one that arrived with a bad brace sent it back got another the first show I used it at the cab blew apart inside not worth the money                 
Welcome to the pros. If you are looking for that classic sound with the built in ability to dial in any tone, this is your head. As a professional musician that plays a lot of shows the fact that it fits inside a rack is great. Setup is a breeze, I have all of my road gear in a rack, just plug in the matched Ampeg classic 4 10 cabinet and your good to go. 10 min top set up/ break down time. Just remember to let those tubes warm up. This is the second SVT 3 I have owned. I had one early 1990's and it never let me down but it was made in USA. This unit is made over sea so time will tell the reliability.  I have always carried extra tubes with me just in case but have never had to use them in a emergency. I change them out once a year. Love zZounds they are great pay and play get the gear you need now at a great price.                 
if god played bass this is what he would use and how he would sound,ive been playing for 20 years and ive used everything from hartke,carvin,eden,aguilar,peavey..and im telling ya this head matched with the svt 810 classic cab its the ultimate in hard rock and country tone. there is flat out no comparison i dont even think the 2500$ ampeg svt tube classic sounds this good and ive used it too.                
the most useful features on this head is the boost buttons and the midrandge requency control,you can literally dial in any tone u need from a tight compressed fat country tone to a rip roaring metal tone using the tube drive knob.possibilites seem endless with this rig.                
its very easy to use all the knobs and switches are self explanitory just plug it to a cab set ur tone turn up ur volume and ur ready to go.                
this bass head is solid as a rock medium thick steel frame,tough knobs,heavyduty sliders on the eq.                
this head may be 800$ new but the thing is once you own it you'll most likely never need another one because its so touch and well made and the tone is amazing,and just because its only 450watts dont let it fool you you'll deffinately cut threw the stage mix regardless if ur lead player is using a marshall jcm2000 or not.                
ive never had to deal with ampeg because this product is so well made its never needed a repair                 
in all respect this peice of equiptment is phenominal,the tone is amazing,its beautiful in its simplicity,its very light weight and not to big or not to small in physical size.i could use my carvin or peavey but question is ,why would i when this sounds so much better?                
i expect to be satisfied with this unit for as long as im allowed to use it,it belongs to the drummer of my band whom owns his own sound buisness providing PA and backline gear for bands willing to pay the rental fee.But i do plan on buying my own & also the svt 8x10 classic cab.                
I have been a Musician and bass player for 36+ years Semi-pro and Now Pro player. I have played on everything you can think of, if you say it I have played it, plain and simple. I have only loved 2 amps in my whole life and when I gave up music years ago for a bit I sold the best amp in the world (Fender Bassman 100 1968 edition) and the second one was an Ampeg (don't remember the model but was tubes) this might be Love #3 but I knew that when I researched Heads, I went with the Pro 3 for weight for international shipping (touring) and I didn't go with the Pro 4. However I love the Pro 4 I figured I will try the Pro 3 and sure enough I was not let down by this unholy thunder I get from it, the guys in the band say they can feel their insides rumble when I crank this up, and things on the rehearsal walls tend to not stay on the walls. I only run an Alpha/Omega Dark Glass for some overdrive and Distortion punch in some parts of my playing. This thing has so many sounds and the EQ bar none is coolest thing, Right on the fly you can change your tone with a movement of the EQ. I will be thinking about getting a 2nd one for my rack because I love to have the thunder at my finger tips for those gigs that the sound guy is sleeping or playing words with friends! If you want a super heavy and flexible head and reliable then look no further. Ampeg has a history of making great amps, and Millions of players can't be wrong!                
After one year I get a very clean sound with almost limitless sound quality options.  Although with all of its options, you can get hiss by turning up the high frequencies too much.  Best if you balance out the EQ with the guitar tones and cabinet adjustments.                
Good features, especially the on the back which allow jacking into house systems & recording equipment. The "Frequency" switch seems to make little difference in sound quality. But, I'm still experimenting with various sound settings.                
After about 50 hours of use, I had to get a tube replaced. But, it may have been due to bumbing, as well as the one bad tube from the factory that day.  Since then (about 150 hours & several months), I've had no problems.                
When I first got my Ampeg, I thought "This sounds great!".  Everytime I play it,I hear from more & more converts saying the same.  And the price has gone up on it since I bought it about a year ago.                
I have not dealt with Ampeg directly, only the local retailer that sold me the equipment.  And after some initial "who has the amp?" mixups, they were pretty good.                
My SVT-3 Pro head, along with my BXT-410HL-4 cabinet, give me a great, unbeatable sound.                
This is a killer/ keeper system.  I'm very satisfied with it.                
this is by far one of the best sounding amps out there. i travel full time with this amp and it has been incredible. the versatility rocks. you can get any where from hard puchy tones, to awesome rock tones, to an incredibly smooth tone. i would recomend this amp to a anyone wanting to get sweet tone, especially for the money.                
an awesome feature is the foot switch. the foot switch rock because you can set your amp up for one smooth tone the kick in the eq for a sweet punchy tone, and when your done with a set you can just mute it and get off stage. for places you cant crank up your rig the direct out still gives you awesome tone. many amps that have direct out s@@k out all of your tone and leave you with a horrible sounding bass.                
this amp is made for the road. i travel full thime with it and it hasnt given me any trouble. i dropped the thing before and it barely made any marks on the amp, and still worked just as awesome.                
this amp is deffinately worth the money. other amps may cost a little less but you wont get near the quality or the tone.                
to be honest support isnt the best. if anyhting should happen to your amp and you have to send it in, dont plan on having it back for a couple of weeks.                
i personally think you have problems saying that an amp has sex appeal or that you could lust over it, but not too many other amps will give you the same tone for the money                
to be honest if i had the money i would buy an svt classic head right now but for 5 or 6 hundred dollars less, nothing comes close.                
I tried and tried and tried and even with the 9 band eq and a sans amp vt bass i just couldn't dial in the tone i wanted. Unpredictable, tone changes, volume drops, etc. Can't turn this amp up very loud without peaking, tubes blow easily. Doesn't seem to pump out alleged 450 watts of power.                 
As disappointed i am with this amp, i can't deny some of its useful features. Tuner out stays active even when mute button is on, 9band eq is nice for those looking for their perfect tone, switchable midrange is nice, and speakon / 1/4" speaker cable inputs a must                
so many tonal options, just couldn't find mine.                
just had my second one malfunction. first one had power issue, just wouldn't turn on. tried everything, different outlets, different cords, etc. only had that one for about a month. and NOW, my second one is making this really horrible scratchy poppy noise that gets worse the longer i have it on! Terrible. only reason i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because the construction of the amp itself and it's knobs levers switches are all very heavy duty and seem to be well made.                 
a thousand bucks for this piece of garbage? save yourself some money and go with a reliable solid state head.                
dealt with zzounds for the first amp that malfunctioned, and they were awesome. friendly, knowledgable support team, not on hold for very long before they picked up and helped me out. haven't dealt with ampeg- hoping they are the same way.                
amp looks great and is rack mountable.                
unsatisfied from the start. definitely looking to buy a different head now- probably a complete solid state. i chose this amp for it's tonal capabilies, which i will admit are vast, but the amp is difficult to use. poor craftsmanship and components are garbage. wouldn't pay over 300 dollars for an amp like this.                
Everything that a bass player needs PERIOD!                
Alot of options.                
SLM manufactured in St. Louis Mo. The best made.                
For the money, you get the power and tone!                
TOTL> Top of the line.                
I have had the Ampeg SVT410HE speakr cabinet long enough for two outdoor gigs. Using it with my Fender 400 Pro bass amp it has an incredible sound. Big, clear and immediate! This speaker cabinet is convenient to transport and set up. These 4 10's plus the 2 10's in the amp can produce not only the full, rich, and deep tones of the more lyrical songs but they can growl with the penetrating trebles for the more extreme rock pieces. This cabinet handled everything I could dish out including the huge tones on the E-sring.
I play the Fender Jazz Bass with the pre-amp pick-up. Fantastic combination!
I'm wondering just what this combo can't do.
The multiple and various jacks in the cabinet back provide ample configurations. Side cabinet handles are convenient and rugged.
The bottom rubber feet are large and hearty.                
Easy!
Yes!
Very easy!
Very short!
Clear!
Very playable!                
The craftmanship and design of this cabinet is simply and elegantly solid.                
Worth the money.                
Too soon to tell.                
This is just the best practical addition to my equipment needs.                
I am considering purchasing the Ampeg SVT15E Bass Cabinet to complete the best bass sound.                
The mids and low mids really punched out for my first outdoor gig with this thing.  I took it out of the box and played it that nite.  I also ran a 15" single out of my amp and it really rocks.  I would hate to be standing in front of this with my 500 watt amp cranked all up.  Punchy, Loud, aggressive, but at the same time, I can stick it in the living room and practice quietly at nite too.  It sounds great with my Ampeg PF500 amp.                
The box seems solid, the casters are a real plus and the grab handles are great. The speakon connectors are really good.  I didn't want to spend $20 on a speaker cord, but I did, and I won't be going back to 1/4" speaker plugs. I wish it had a matching cover that came with the unit.  I haven't got much satisfaction out of the high range adjustment, it seems to get a hiss if it is up too high, but I will tinker with it some more to dial it in.                
I combo'ed it with a 15" cabinet.  When I was using the 15" cab by itself, I was constantly over driving the speakers, but this cab will be hard to overdrive, and coupled with my 15" I get great lows and all the mids you can stand.                
I took this thing out of the box and gigged it that nite.  It is a nice made piece, but damn I wish it was USA made.  Next time I will pony up the extra bucks for the good old USA craftsmen who make the Heritage series. Product seems solid.                
Pretty good bang for the buck.                
Don't reckon I will need em anytime soon.                
Hard to beat the Ampeg name plate for sex appeal.  Maybe they could make some retro looking cabs with the same technology and equipment.                
I love it.  Wish I could have afforded the USA made stuff, wish it came with a cover, and a speakon cord but I love it anyway.  The sounds available are really limited only by your amp and style.                
This amp is amazing.  It's extremely versitle, great for playing alternative/metal.                
Not really any accessories, other than the wheels, but it is just a cab...                
Plug it in and you are ready to rip it up.                
No blemishes, and I've had no problems with it.                
It is a bit more expensive than the average amp, but ampeg privides the durability you can trust when purchasing equipment.                
Haven't dealt with any issues at all.                
When you see it in person, you'll know this thing is a beauty.  I keep it in my room, and the size of it is impressive by itself.  It'f real "sex appeal" comes in when it's played, and the deep bass tones kick in.                
I replaced defective Hartke VX 8-10 bottom with it. This Ampeg 4-10 cabinet weighs 90 lbs compared to hartke 8-10 bottom that weighted 140lbs. Talk about Ampeg quality!! The Hartke cabinet fell apart, literatly. Internal bracing broke loose on two different cabinets. Must be that "Made in China" craftsmanship.                
Has multipal input jacks on rear as well as adjustable horn pad. Hartke cab had one plastic 1/4 inch input jack. Cheap.                
90 lbs?? You can feel, see, hear......the quality. Hartke should take a few lessons from Ampeg. Built in the USA like a tank!                
Expensive, but well worth it. Ampeg is the best.                
Dealt with the company for information only. Very helpful. Hartke "lack of customer service dept." was another animal in itself. Stay away from them.                
Plain jane look about it, with that Ampeg badge. Rattles the walls.                
Ampeg gear is the best and used by the most in the industry. I will never change brands again.                
You can't beat the volume and punch this cab has to offer, unless you get the ampeg 8x10.                
I was upset that I had to buy a cable to go with it, so upset that I think it deserves an 8.                
You can give this guy a hell of a beating, and it'll beat you right back.                
Great Price.                
havent needed it.                
You'll have all the ladies swooning.                
It's an Ampeg.  Crystal clear sound. I crank it way up, and never distorts ot falters in any way.                
The horn can be adjusted to where you like it. Speakon or 1/4 inch inputs. Just a basic bass cab.                
I gave it a 9 becasue it's so dang heavy. So to use it, it takes effort to bring it to where I need it. After that it's plug and play.                
Well, this is the only area I was dissappointed in becasue of the covering. The covering is coming off in many spots.  This is not due to abuse or neglect. It's used regularly and is moved around a lot.  I think my Peavey held up better. The bulk of problems start when the covering got a little hot at outside gig. It tore from a zipper on a gig bag of my bass laying on top of it. The wood is good sturdy and the wheels help a lot.                
It's high end gear for the high end price. In the end everybody would like to pay less.                
 Never needed them with this or other Ampeg stuff I have had.                
This thing will work for ever. I won't buy another one unless I get another one just like it to stack! I just need to either cover it again or spray paint it. Thought about putting diamond plate on it.                
I drive this cab with an all tube 100W Ampeg V-4B. Nice clarity and detail. The low end is there but not boomy. The castors and tow bar are very handy. Plenty-O-Volume and air blast when she is cranked. Zzounds came in $100 less than everyone else which sealed the deal for me.                
The sound is the reason I bought this cab.  It's the only cab I could find that combines a punchy sound with fat/full low ends.                 
As far as bass cabinets go, it has the adjustible horn, speakon jacks, regular 1/4 jacks, what else do you need?                
Built like a tank! Covered in what appears as a light coat of PVC.  The heavy transport bar and built in wheels make this beast easy to move around.                
Sound is worth every penny. If I skimped, I would have to trade up eventually which we all you you lose when you start playing that game.                
No reason to call, no problems.                
After each jam/gig I can't wait to play through it again!  Above average visual appeal, amazing sound appeal - which is what drives me.                
Right now, I feel I never want to purchase another bass cab.  I've played 4 10"s that don't have the same low end, I've played many 15" that don't have the punch or the presence. This cabinet does it all and no need to cart around 2 stacks.  I was also very pleasantly suprised that this cab didn't distort at extreme volumes, just sound full/punchy/fat and great!!!!                
In my honest opinion, Ampeg IS the sound of bass.  Being the pioneer of bass amplification, Ampeg has the goods to deliver now and well into the future.  The 410HLF has tremendous low end, growly mids and pristene highs.  I am using it in conjunction with an Ampeg head and they go together sonically like a jacket and matching pants!!                
I appreciate the fact that it sits flat on the floor which helps transmit sound.  But if it has to be moved, just grab the rear mounted bar, tilt it back and away you go, effortlessly!                
The 410HLF is a Clydesdale among Shetlands!  Made to do the job.  It's definitely a road worthy piece of equipment.                
I compared this product with other cabinets (some priced higher) and this one was hands-down the best of the lot.                
I've owned Ampeg products in the past and have never had to call the company with any problems.                
This one is a keeper!  Considering the magnatude of the low end of this cabinet, for my purposes, I don't need a separate sub wooofer!                
The cab seems to adjust to your sound very well. Nice warm bluesy tone, sweet slap tone and takes tube overdrive well. Killer lows in a live setting and the horn control knob is great and solves the mudd problem when the lows are cranked!!                 
If this fell down my steps, I'd worry more about my steps or anyone in the way! It's built solid and still smells new after a year(i know, i'm weird)                 
Between the horn control, the ports, the connections and the quality, it's worth it.                
Smooth, sleek looks and I've found during many a show that the handle on the back is a good towelrack                
Sweet cab!! This will be a staple in my rig. If anything, I would add a sub and 2 tens just for the edge in a large open setting.                 
I use this as my sub-cabinet for my home studio system.crystal clear sound no distortion love it......................                
I found that I was blowing out speakers due to my down-tuning along with my extended range basses. I search the zZounds website and found exactly what I was looking for to pair up with my Ampeg SVT-CL. The cab is punchy, clear, pushes plenty of air, and gives depth when I hit that low A string. The pay as you play plan again made it possible for me to afford the gear I needed.                
I used to run 8 - 10s...and it kicked butt...BUT i went to a 5 string bass and grew tired of lugging  8 10s....I needed something smaller that can handle the LOWs of a 5 string bass... THIS IS IT....IT sounds thick and tight...easy to transport...the ports throw the lows well.... THIS IS THE REAL DEAL...well worth it.                
The sound on this amp is amazing, i used my Behringer BX3000T on it and it hits the lows really well and the highs to. And it can really handle the ultrabass mode on my Behringer.                
It pretty blane, but then again its a bass amp                
Its ok to use i just wish it had 4 wheels on it instead of 2. and its not that heavy, heavy is over 150 lbs at least.                
They did an excellence job on this amp. Every bass player should use this cause it fits with almost every kind of style of music.                
I wanted to actually buy one to own but holy mother of ..... that is kinda expensive for someone in college                
Dont know so ill just give it a 10                
No sex appeal but you could have that on top of this thing its so stout.                
The way they built this amp is Sweet, that is the reason i own an Ampeg but not this one yet i have a BSE-410H, basically the smaller verison of this one with less features. AND IT IS FOR SALE RIGHT NOW!                
The sound (particularly the low end) is simply incredible. I auditioned 2 of the top competing 4x10 speakers cabinets (Eden & SWR) and found the HLF to be superior in every way. IMO, it simply doesn't get any better than this.                
It's relativley heavy. But, the casters, back slide, and heavy duty side handles make it a breeze to move. The integrated horn and rear mounted attenuator are another exceptional feature of this cabinet.
Rear input/ouput jacks (1/4" or Speakon) allow total flexability when choosing speaker interconnect cables.
As easy a pie. Simply choose a quality 1/4" or Speakon cable...plug it in, set the horn attenuator to the desired level, and play.                
Cabinet construction is excellent. A clean non cluttered cosmetic design says "all business." The tolex covering is "tight" (no visible seams), Rear input/output jacks are of the highest quality and solidly mounted. Heavy Duty metal side handles, back slide handle, chrome corners, and casters are all of the highest quality. 
With all due respect to my former Peavey rig, Peavey cabinets are made from OSB, tolex seams are poor and subject to tearing, and plastic side handles which are prone to breakage.
Some folks seem to object to Ampeg's use of grill cloth (as opposed to metal grate.) I don't don't see this as a deficiency as there is no possibility of "rattle" with grill cloth and less chance of accidentally "poking" a speaker cone. Just use a good quality cover (or ATA case) and worry no more about the grill cloth.                
Well worth every cent I spent. IMO a superior product to similar Eden and SWR offerings at a lower price.                
Although I've never had a problem with the HLF, I did call support regarding an impedence question and received a rapid and courteous response.                
As mentioned, a clean, no nonsense appearance. The true "marvel" of this cabinet is the engineering that premits it to accurately reproduce a clean audible tone down to 28Hz.                 
I have no plans to replace this cabinet -ever. If I had to though, I would look no further than another HLF.
As mentioned, I am convinced that this cabinet is superior to both cpmparable Eden and SWR 410's (which I've not only auditioned, but used.) And, at a slightly lower price. Hard to beat that equation.                
Sound characteristics are superb - particularly with regard to low-end. Cabinet compares favorably to an 8x10 at a lower price point, and of course, superior portability. 5-String bassists will be particularly impressed with the sound reproduction of their low B string. Truly a wonderfully engineered piece of eqipment.                 
Despite its weight, the 410-HLF is quite portable as a result of integrating the rear casters + collapsable slide handle.
1/4" and/or speakon input/output jacks are a real "plus." In addition, the integrated horn and attenuator permit a variey of tonal adjustments.                
As easy as it gets !!                
Built like a tank -and- cosmetically appealing. "fit and finish" is excellent....exactly what one would expect from Ampeg.                
The "HLF" is worth every penny of it's price. Note too that Ampeg resale value is "second to none."                 
Have never had a problem with my 410-HLF(s.) However, prior service issues with Ampeg (2 in 40+ years) were handled expediently, and without issue. The 5-year guarantee is perhaps the best in the industry.                
As an "old pro," frankly, it's a bit difficult to find "sex appeal" in any piece of equipment. I tend to think of basses and amp/cabs as tools of my trade. 
I think, however, that the 410-HLF is a marvel with regard to its acoustically engineered ability to accurately reproduce excellent tonality down to 28Hz.                
Depending on the venue, I use either 1 or 2 410-HLFs (or 1 410-HLF with an SVT-18) coupled with an Ampeg SVT 4-PRO. I have no plans to ever replace either the amplifier or cabs. If, however, fate mandated replacement, I would once again purchase an identical Ampeg configuration.                 
For most bass players that play music in the most common genres (rock/alt/blues/soul/punk etc.) you cannot go wrong with the tone that this cab will put out. Use it with any SVT pro head and a Fender P-bass, J-bass or good quality bass and you will be in tone heaven.                
Standard features of a bass cab. 4 10" speakers, side handles, and rolling wheels (def a nice feature cause it's super heavey)                
The wheels def help...                
OK, so this is where my issues start. I'm on my second cabinet now from new. First one I blew 2 speakers after having it only 4 weeks, second one now I just blew another speaker after having it about 2 months. NOt quite sure what is going on. I use an SVT 3 Pro head, so I'm not pumping any crazy amount of amplitude through it. These issues just make me wonder about the "roadworthiness" of these cabs and how they will stand up to the test of time....                
If you can pick one up for around $500/$600, it is good value for money.                
Not dealt with Ampeg yet, just local dealer who were very helpful.                
It's a pretty boring design, but it's a classic...and classic is always SEXY!                
I'm going to give it one more shot at fixing the blown speaker, but if it goes again, I'll be onto to GK or SWR land....                
After a long absence from the music business, I set out on a quest for find an amp an cabinet setup that would rival my Acoustic 360 from "back in the day". I had played Ampeg back then, too, but found them to distort like everything else at high volume. I didn't think Ampeg would een be on my search list. After trying every brand and speaker combination available in stores, I purchased The SVT410HLF.
Loud and clear open E's as bassy as you can send to the cabinet.                
Has everything a cabinet should                
ease of use?  its a cabinet..PLUG the amp into it!                
a "9" because I've only had it a year.  So far...just fine                
you get what you pay for.  Pro gear costs more than geear for the basement.                
Called about an SVTpro4 head, good knowledge, but their first assumtion was I didn't have a clue how to use it....they were right, but they could have been kinder.                
let's just say I want a SECOND one.                
I'll likely keep it until death do us part                
Iplay it through a classic svt 300 watt tube amp. If god played bass (s)he'd play Ampeg.                
solid easy to understand simple                
a+                
very solid, I have no idea how that one guy managed to blow it up maybe he used the wrong omage??                
Its expensive but you can sell for almost what you'd payed for it so i guess its all good value (if you sell)                
donno havent had any problems yet                
i have it                
Has real deep tone for metal and if i want to play some funk is tweeky enough for pops.                
best tone I've ever had.....this thing moves air...classic ampeg tone....there are better horns out there but I hardly use it so I'm not going to knock off marks for that....I LOVE THIS CAB!!!!                
2 speakon conections, 2 quarter" conections plus a horn voume knob...the handles are great and the bar across the top is genious....get a cover for it though...tolex will rip and you must be careful with the cloth grill but i'm not complaining, it looks like classic ampeg...                
it's ampeg, it's quality!!!!
definetly worth every penny                
haven't needed it                
put it to you this way....if some jerk off steals steals it from me (again), I'll go out and buy a new one                
best cab i've ever owned...better than any other 410 out there....I'M DEAD SERIOUS!!!!!                
This amp has TONES of TONE!!
I've had mine for four years now and play usually two shows a weekend sometimes four. No Joke.
It still has so much volume, and I'm not referring to loudness which is without question loud! I'm referring to the expanse of the concussion and reverberation of the bass. I always say I don't play this bass, I feel it! On a normal basis I use the PR410HLF cab but when I really need to kickstart the earth's core and make everyones amps almost fall over I'll pair it with the SVT-410HE - Forget about it!                
I love being able to control my mainline out and stage volume seperately, EQ works great, Compression, I keep low bout 1/4. Brightness really does just that.                
It's all right there. Not complicated or full of gadgets. It's a Bass amp, ya just gotta find your tone.
All I've added was a KORG Tuner and the BBE.
Set it and forget it.                
It's a MAC Truck, has taken disturbing drops in the rack but never a glitch.                
Not cheap but ya get what ya play for.                
? Support for what ? Happy customer from the first day I rattled the house.                
Great looking in the rack.                
If this keeps performing a well as it has I don't see a need to look into anything else other than add another SVT IV Pro for the Festival and stadium stages. I and everyone else love this amp, the compliments are endless.                
Great sound quality and versatility. I'm using this amp for hard rock/blues, and could not be happier with the sound. Especially with the gain cranked up a bit for a little "growl".                
The only complaint might be that I think a foot switch should have been included for the price. I'm not really using this feature, however, so it's no big deal. Also, the amount of output options on this amp is incredible. Probably more than I would ever need, but it's nice to have them available.                
I've only had it for a few months, but it seems to be built very solidly. I've got it mounted in a ten space rack which took a spill from the top of a speaker stack during a show (from the massive low end vibration and poor stacking on my part). I finished the set with this amp laying upside down on the stage and it never hesitated at all! The rest of the band and the sound engineer didn't even know anything had happened!                
I guess this amp can be a little pricey for some (myself included), but you get what you pay for and I feel this was money well spent.                
I've heard that it's good, but I've had no need to contact them yet.                
I'm completely happy with this amp and don't have any plans to replace it anytime soon! I've heard some people say that the power rating on this amp is overstated. When used in the biamp configuration, it does seem a little quiet. But, when used in the bridged-mono setup, this thing comes alive!!                
I've had my eye this amp for quite some time, saw the special 12 month pay plan and decided to take the leap.  I've heard this amp in action and it sounds great Mono Bridged @ 1200 Watts RMS with a Gallien-Krueger Neo 412 Cabinet - rated for 1200 Watts RMS all night long and 2400 Watts Power Handling!  I'm still trying to get a hold of the Gallien-Krueger Neo 412 Cab.  I wish zZounds.com would carry them.  Listen, you can't go wrong by buying an SVT-4 Pro Bass Amp.  You can really feel the power of this amp.                
Awesome sound, temporarily using it with a small fender cabinet w/4-10's and this amp really enhances the sound quality.  Quick response and great control.  Features abound and this really makes live bass sound like recoreded base.  Even the rest of the band leaned toward my gear at the first gig, and said... "That thing really kicks".  
A tip with this amp... play with the adjustments, and turn the bass guitar all the way up to allow full instrument tone, adjust the "Gain" until the limit light blinks, then adjust final volume with the Master.  This made a major difference with my Rudy Sarzo Bass gutar.                
Great look on stage in my rack mount.  Looks to be built like a battleship. But I'm particular about my amp rig, so it will not be stashed in the equipment truck. Instead it will go home with me.                
Wished they had a customer service line on Saturdays.  I had some questions and there was no Hotline for me to call for direction.                
We play deep dark heavy blues, tuned to Drop C. Of all the heads I have played the 4-pro was far bigger sounding, and had all the punch I look for.                
I added the Ampeg foot switch for my mute and for the eq. it is worth looking into, it was the only thing I could think of out of the box that I wished for.                
This is a pro head, it took a couple of minutes of reading to understand setting it up, but once I started, it was easy, and it is worth reading, because this head is so versatile.                
Crash boom bang, life on the road happens, this head has been thru a ton, and is still working like day one.
Worst thing about the 4-pro, its heavy...                
Takes a licking, easy to set up, works hard as I do, yeah, great bang for the buck, that = great value in my book.                
I have only had one question for them, it was over the configuration of the mono bridge cable, and they were very helpful.                
Once I had heard the 4-pro I knew I had to have it.                
I have played the 4-pro for some time, and I can not ever think of a different head. I can and will always say, it is heavy, but it is worth the weight.                
killer low end power, good tube grind, great for rock, punk, metal anything that needs guts.                 
great EQ options 
easy to customize                 
Ive heard they can have issues but have never ran into one with daily use                 
much more natural sounding then anything Mesa makes for a lower price.                 
never had to deal with the company for any reason
good enough sign for me                 
Ampegs are hot                 
nothing suits my needs better                 
I've had other Ampeg speakers, SVT810 and 410HLF, and this speaker would seem like a compromise of the two, but it isn't. It has all the tone of the 810 and the low freq of the 410HLF with more volume. I like the way it projects to the entire room with clean, clear, deep power without being too loud in any one spot. I play with all my fingers and thumbs to get different textures of sound. This cab lets you do anything you want.                   
Speakon and quarter inch inputs. Cool rail sliders on back keeps you from doing a lot of damage loading in and out of vehicles. Towel bar and wheels work great on smooth surfaces. Would be better if wheels were larger in diameter. In grass, dirt, rocks, etc use a hand truck.                
Yeah, it's got powerful lows, mids, and highs. You can overdo it, but if you have half a brain and know anything about gain structure you can get killer sound.                
I've got one made with plywood. I hear some aren't. The grill on the front can be damaged easily, careful with that. Internal bracing is top notch, no rattles at all. Looks great.                
It is a premium speaker and I did pay dearly. Yeah, it is worth it.                
There wasn't a choice of "Don't Know". Never had to deal with them.                
You put one or more of these things behind you and everybody will know you came prepared. I push it with a vintage black face Hartke 3500. Excellence. This thing makes even me look good. It's just the right height too. Short cabs shoot the sound out to the audience but not up to you, which makes you play louder than you should. They are also harder to load into a truck or van or SUV. This one you just tip over and push. Done.                
I've owned many manufacturers' cabinets since 1967. I've even owned a couple of early 70's Ampeg 810's. Several of the speaker leads burned in two. Sold 'em for something else. Had an SVT410HLF, too short. Then came the chance to get the 610. This is the one. I play live and record with it. It fits me well.                  
I have been playing bass for about 15 years now and have had numerous bass rigs and Combo amps. This is my first Ampeg and I wish I had of got one from the get go. This cab is sick! It has amazing Lows for 10" Drivers, which I have never been able to get with any 410 cab. Have always needed a 15 to get a decent sound. I can use this cab alone for most indoor shows and have no problem filling the room. Will still drag out a 15 for outdoor shows but this cab is def my Main now.                 
Awesome cabinet! Killer tone, very well built. Couldn't be happier!                
I don't give 10's.  This thing sounds amazing though.  Punchy and deep and loud.  Does the job admirably.                
OK, so here's a 10.  This thing has neutrik jacks and a horn attenuator.  What else do you need?
I do like the handle and wheels.  They make it relatively easy to lug around.  Also the rails on the basck are a big plus to protect the back from damage when sliding it in the back of my van.                
Another 10!  I mean, plug n play.  Duh.                  
The Tolex could be tougher, but otherwise it's pretty stout.                
I got mine used for $500.  I think it's a good value at that price :)                
Haven't dealt with them.                
Yup.                
Great cab.  Takes lots of power and puts out punchy sound.                
Alright so I bought this thinking that this item is perfect.  It is light-weight and produces 1000W of power!!!  Not to mention it is Ampeg which is known for its high quality sound and products!  Not to mention a lot of professional bass players run Ampeg systems and so bam!  I bought it and at first sight I loved it.  The sound that it produced was unbelievable.  I could not be happier.  Keep in mind I play a BC Rich Widow 5 String Bass through a Boss ME-50B pedal with a Sonic maximizer i428 through a Ampeg 410HLF cab.  So anyway first few practices go beautifully and I am stoked my band is stoked and then 4-6 practices later is when the problems begin.  In the middle of practice the Amp starts shutting itself off then back on.  It was getting really frustrating.  Some practices it happened and other times it did not.  I was getting really worried to because I just got this product and it is already causing me problems.  So anyway I played one gig with no problems and the very next practice it happened again.  I called up ZZounds and explained my problem and they said that it was fine and they would ship me a new one if I prepaid for it up front or just ship the one I have with me.  I prepaid for the new one to be sent to me and I got this one in with no problems. It has not cut out since and I hope it stays working for the years to come.                
I was a little skeptical about buying a D-Class amp, but pulled the trigger out of need and the convenience of the monthly installment plan. I'd read the reviews and when I received the amp head I fully checked it out. Guess what, the amp switched off repeatedly after about ten minutes of concert level playing. Thermal shutdown was not an option here. So I packed it up, notified Zzounds and shipped it off. They had a new one on my doorstep in 4 business days.
When I received and checked the second unit, no problems. I had a big casino show two days later and wanted the tone and look on top of my SVT Anniversary 810e cabinet, but I brought along my SWR Working Mans Head just in case. The SVT 7-Pro performed flawlessly. Nothing beats the tone. I am also a progressive rock guitarist and my well known friend runs two SVT 2-Pros *courtesy of Ampeg*, and the tone is killer. I have to say I didn't miss anything in tone not to mention the excessive weight and cost of the all tube version. I've only had it three weeks now, but 3 more shows (all out-door) and it hasn't skipped a beat. Thanks to Zzounds for getting me a replacement toot sweet!                
I bought a SVT-CL from ZZOUNDS and received it in just a few days.  I played in a band in the late 70's and 80's and always wanted this head as we are starting to play again and I can afford a SVT now.  I was really excited about getting this head and could not wait to try it out. I really liked the sound of the SVT through my Ampeg 8x10 cabinet.  My brother and I practiced  for almost 2hrs the night I got my head and the SVT shut down.  I turned it off for about 5 minutes and turned it on again and it lasted about 10 more minutes before it shut down again.  I could not believe this amp only lasted for 2 hours.  Contacted ZZOUNDS the next morning by email to tell them what happened.  By early afternoon, ZZOUNDS emailed me a UPS return slip thatI printed and boxed the SVT up and sent it back that evening.  I decided to get the SVT7PRO to replace the SVT-CL.(I just didn't trust the SVT-CL and the tube power after my short ownership)  The next day I get a email from ZZOUNDS that my new head was in route to me...they did not even wait to see the SVT-CL I was sending back and check to see if I had dropped the head and broke it or abused it. Now that is customer service! ZZOUNDS takes care of their customers. I got the SVT7PRO in just a few days and really like it.  To me it sounds as good as the SVT-CL. It sounds great for the style music we play(rock and roll, country). I have no complaints with this head. I have been playing this head for over a month now and no issues. I would recommend to everyone.                
I received the SVT7PRO well packaged and in perfect condition.                
Compared to the SVT-CL, I would choose the SVT7PRO.                
I have not dealt with AMPEG.                
I am through looking, for now, but if I buy anything else, it will be from ZZOUNDS!                
I've been playing bass for 34 years and gig several times a month. I typically use an Ampeg 8x10 cab with a 1978 Ampeg SVT head. Wanting lose some gear weight, but keep the tone, 
I bought an SVT 7 pro to try out. This thing rocks,and is lightweight! It has a gain and a master volume. It has very powerful eq and tone options. 
The built in compressor is, as Ampeg claims,very transparent. By using some compression you can really turn the gain up and avoid clipping the preamp. 
I a/b'd the vintage all tube ampeg with the svt-7 pro. As one might exepct,the vintage all tube SVT head is louder and has more warmth. That having been said 
the svt-7 pro has more versatile eq options IMO, and held it's own against the best. I will have no hesitation sitting this thing on top of my cabinet at the next gig.
At 15.5 lbs. versus 75 lbs. my back will love it.
I haven't tried recording using the "tube direct out", but based on what I've heard so far,and looking at the design, I expect that to be very useful in the studio.                
No support needed,but Ampeg has responded wellin the past.                
the sound and tone i get from this amp is unparalleled ,by far the best amp iv ever used , extremely versatile and will give you the tone you want no matter what style you play                 
plug in and play !                
sturdy and tough                 
its ampeg , there name is worth its wight in gold                 
extremely satisfied with this amp                 
After years of playing Mesa,Carvin,Fender, Line6 bass amps, I decided to give Ampeg a whirl again after once owning an SVTPro4. This 1000w amp combined with my SVT610 cab and a Fender American Deluxe Jazz 5 string bass is my dream rig.
Turn it on, dial it in and unleash the thunder. I can go from smooth R&B tones to bone-crushing overdriven rock mayhem. What else can a person ask for?
Thanks to Ampeg for double boxing this product and Zzounds for adding their shipping box. FedEx threw it over my 5' tall side yard fence in the middle of a heavy snow/rain storm. The outer box disintegrated upon retrieval, which had me in a fuming mad rage. No worries, the rest of the packaging saved the day.
I checked out a few videos on YouTube on the proper way to dial in your sound/gain structure and then I was up and running in less than 5 minutes.                
What more can I say... I has all of the power that I need and also gives that classic Ampeg sound whether I play though a small amp or an 8X10 cabinet... It just sounds great and has plenty of power for whatever you are playing through!!!                
The sound was bigger and better than I expected and I'm playing with a Peavy cabinet that doesn't even come close to the ampeg svt 810 cabinet, which I will be purchasing as soon as I pay this head off!                
great features cant wait to try it out to it's full capabilities! again as soon as I pay the head off I will buy the 810 svt cabinet!                 
very easy to use not complicated at all as I expected!                
i recieved this product promptly after I ordered it within days It was packaged very well and free of any damages this is the best quality bass amp I have ever owned ampeg is number one in reputation and quality, for good reason and now I know!!!Love it!                
The Ampeg SVT-7PRO Bass Amp Head is a great head for a great price! and it was $50 cheaper than others i compared it to! some other vendors were even charging $100 more!                
No haven't needed any service, nor had any problems!                 
lightweight! powerful, sturdy! looks very cool!                
Very satisfied! cant wait to purchase the Ampeg SVT 810 cabinet, that will go great with the Ampeg SVT PRO-7 Head I bought!!!                
What a awesome amp head, I would have never dreamed that a small head like this could put out the power that it does!!!! Another thing, unlike alot of heads I've played through this still such a full sound at extremely low levels!! Ease of use and tonal variations are so awesome!!! I'm still playing around with it to see what else I can pull out of it!!! I'll let you guys know!!!!                
Combined with the 4x10 Heritage and Jazz Deluxe V I am able to cover a wide range of tone with minimal fiddling. I've owned a lot of rigs including expensive esoteric all tube set ups. This blows em all away. Also get consistent compliments on my tone - for the first time.                
Great Amp all the power and tone quality I need.                
This is the best power amp that I have ran thru ever!!!  Great tone no matter what kind of music I am playing... Light weight, but very powerful.. It plays my Ampeg 8x10 and sounds great!!                 
I received the first new head with a surprise. I took it to rehearsal, plugged it in and no sound. I was very upset but after speaking with customer service I shipped it back and received a replacement immediately. This units works fine and I am happy with the sound. The amp has good sound with eq flat and I love the compressor to tighten things up. I also use its headphone feature when practicing personally.                
This product has an overheating issue.It has great sound once you dial it in ,but that takes waay too long ,I gig regularly and I constantly have to mess with it.I know that in a perfect world you should be able to set it and forget it,but just constantly messingwith it is aggravating.Mine overheated and caught fire 1 year after purchase.They fixed it ,but now its even more annoying than it was before.I would NOT recommend this amp.                
First of all, big kudos to zZounds.com for a great deal and great customer service.  Really nice amp.  Gives a real nice Ampeg sound - comparable to SVT3Pro.  I like the smaller weight, although still feels very solid.  I would've actually liked it a tad smaller but much better than most others.  Fan is a little loud - not bad, just not silent.  Will not be a problem in live settings.  Also, I noticed a very small amount of noise - not unlike what you would get from a pedal - mostly when treble was high.  Again, would not be a problem live.  I mention these, but they are very slight, and I am pretty picky.  That said, I don't believe these are bad enough to return the head.  I am looking forward to gigging it soon.  Not sure if I want to rack it yet, so I wouldn't mind finding a nice bag for it.                
No eq, which other Ampeg heads have.  I don't think you will miss it.  I like the compressor.  Wouldn't mind an on board tuner.                
Pretty easy.  slight adjustments and you are sounding good.  Not a lot of knobs, so not too complicated.                
Fit and finish are great.  Have heard about some bad units, but so far no problems here.  Solid unit                
I think this is a pretty good value.  Class D - solid unit, ampeg tone, light weight.                 
A tad boxier and less flashy than some of the other Ampegs, but still and Ampeg and still a nice looking unit.                
Turns itself off if turned past half way and played for more than 45 minutes. Too bad I ran into this problem after the 30 days because I got the B stock. It doesn't happen if it's on low volume but what's the use of a 1000 watt practice amp. The sound was nice but having it cut out on me during a live performance was the end of my trust.                 
Great amp while it lasts. Ampegs tried and true tone section is awsome. Seems they dont do so well with the class D power amps. This amp has barely been pushed ( a year old)  through a PN-115HLF and what I have now is a $1700 fart machine. Cmon Ampeg, judging by all the electronics issues in reviews is it really worth that extra buck in profit by building in some foriegn slave camp just to f up your good name and and what was a great amp? You guys almost sunk before, lessons learned?  Ill have to replace this now, Mesa here I cone...                
True ampeg tone. I play mostly hardcore/metalcore type music and this does the job very well. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for high power and massive tone. The DI is great. Most gigs I'm running direct and use my ampeg 610 cab for stage volume. Haven't had a single issue trying to find my sound. 
Careful though, it does pack a large amount of power, almost destroyed my 610                
Definitely nice to have the headphone option which I use a lot for pre gig jamming. The frequency selector is nice and does change the tone a bit. And having 1 kilowatt of power is also a nice touch to have.                 
No learning curve here. Just plug it in. Make sure the voltage selector is correct in the back. Pluh in your guitar and flip the switch. If you've use an amp head before, then dialing in your tone won't be a problem for you.                 
Very well made. Sturdy and built like a tank. It's an ampeg so you know you're getting quality. I've been using it non stop on the road for about a month now with out a single issue. I carry a back up because you never know when you'll need one. It stays mounted in a rack with the latest included rack ears.  It's pretty easy on the back as well as its a pretty light little amp. Back mounted fan is always nice as opposed to GK which mount theirs on the top.                 
For what you pay, you're getting a lot. I've spent a lot of research trying to find the best amp for me. Features and wattage play a big roll in what I look for with amps, and this definitely has the most when compared to other 1000 watt heads in the same price range.                 
I've used them in the past. Calling them is the easiest route.                 
Not necessarily a sexy item, but does look nice in my rack and is very nice on my eyes                
I think this is a winner for me for awhile. Has all the power I need and is built like a tank. I'll probably only replace it if ampeg has a newer model with more power and same price. If it were stolen, I wouldn't hesitate to grab another one, it's perfect!                 
turned its self off after first time use sent back to factory they sent a new one now back in it goes i gig regularly and dont trust this head at all a shame because i have a 15" and 4x10 classic cabs very dissatified

Very well made. Sturdy and built like a tank. It's an ampeg so you know you're getting quality. I've been using it non stop on the road for about a month now with out a single issue. I carry a back up because you never know when you'll need one. It stays mounted in a rack with the latest included rack ears.  It's pretty easy on the back as well as its a pretty light little amp. Back mounted fan is always nice as opposed to GK which mount theirs on the top.                 
For what you pay, you're getting a lot. I've spent a lot of research trying to find the best amp for me. Features and wattage play a big roll in what I look for with amps, and this definitely has the most when compared to other 1000 watt heads in the same price range.                 
I've used them in the past. Calling them is the easiest route.                 
Not necessarily a sexy item, but does look nice in my rack and is very nice on my eyes                
I think this is a winner for me for awhile. Has all the power I need and is built like a tank. I'll probably only replace it if ampeg has a newer model with more power and same price. If it were stolen, I wouldn't hesitate to grab another one, it's perfect!                 
it sounds ok but have to turn gain up almost wide open, wouldnt expect a 1000w to have such low power. I was dissappointed. I have a Hartke 350 watt that sounds 10 times better and better response. I bought this in May 2011 and it burned up 3 months later...Ampeg did replace it but I have the replacement in the original box...never used it since...looking to sell it, if I get 500 I will be happy                
apparently Ampeg used junk generic parts to build this amp.                
Burned out 3 months of use.....LOL JUNK                
Buy a Hartke, its cheaper better sound quality and more reliable                
yes I contacted Loud and they did replae the amp when it burned out, but took 4 weeks to get the replacement...good thing I kept my Hartke!                
no                
never buy Ampeg again                
I've been playing since 1976, and I'm not dead yet. My cabinets of choice have been Acoustic and boogies. I just bought the 810 Classic because I ordered the pf410 and honestly it was small yet not the oomph I need for a classic rock 80's LOUD club band.I drove myself crazy with the Heritage vs Classic question. I bought the Classic because 300 bucks is 300 bucks.. I cannot be happier. Took it out for the first time last night. All night long the oohs and ahs were amazing. punch, tone, I tilted it into the trunk of my Mercury marquis and boom a bungee strap and done. It;s like wheeling in a cart. I know great tone this has it in droves... I play a BBE AB preamp (300 dollars) a yamaha 3500s amp. run the 810 in stereo when I hit my digitech s100 for chorus etc... don't believe the Heritage deal...I'm sure it's great but if 300 bucks can pay some bills don't waste your money. I took my box, covered in a layer of really nice black duct tape and made my own cover...for 30 bucks.... sturdy, no tolex mishaps at all... plus all the gig bags get stowed in it while at the gig. Can't wait to get my accord station wagon up and running to make transport even easier..... thanks zZounds for payment plan too!                
I've only played my SVT-CL head out of Ampeg cabs, and the 8x10 is simply the best match for the amp.  It gives me my dream sound by handling the highs quite nicely wihtout sounding too sharp or caustic; the mids help my bass cut through my guitarist's screaming Marshall; and the lows are enough to handle the heaviest hitting drummers on the planet.  Oh, those lows!  Turn up as LOUD as you want and you will notice the lows are still clear--not soggy and undefined.  This amp will handle whatever you've got, and it doesn't stop delivering.  It's sound is BIG, BIG, BIG--you will not get lost amid the blissful chaos you and your bandmates create.  They will know you're there--but the 4x10s and even the 6x10s won't let you make that claim.  It also records quite well.  You can simply put a mic in front of a single speaker and be amazed when you hear the recording.  And you will know that you now sound like you think you should sound.  With the SVT-CL, this cab reproduces that sound you dream about in your head.  A wet dream come true!                
Simple.  The grab-bar/handle-thing on the back, along with the built-in coasters, make for easy maneuverability.                
Never met an Ampeg cab with a sound that sucked.  As I mentioned, a big head like the SVT-CL may be too much for smaller cabs to handle; but this cab is designed to handle Ampeg's best heads.  Plug in and play.                
We keep it in the studio, so the only time we'll ever move it is for gigs.  It's solid, heavy, and durable.                  
Worth the price.  The top-of-the-line 410 costs just as much as the 810.  The 610 is fifty bucks cheaper.  Go with the big daddy of them all and be happy.                
Haven't had to deal with support, yet.                
It ain't ugly.  Would it appear more appealing dressed in a metal grille with fuzzy carpet instead of cloth and tolex?  LISTEN to it and then ask yourself if you care what it looks like.                
I have no need for another rig.  To me, this one fits my playing perfectly, and it gives me and the band the sound that now plays a big role in defining us.  It growls, it roars, it cannot be beat.  If it were stolen (how can you lose something this big?), I would die.  There's no way I'd play out of a different cabinet.                  
beautiful                
great                
even though it is a tad bit on the pricey side, it is well worth it even though it's 165 lbs                
i have it and it is awesome                
only for the serious musicians who play quite a bit...but it absolutey  sucks to drag it around because of how big it is but that is well worth it to put out the sound you want for at venues. get it if you think you can handle it...                
Can't say enough about this cabinet, especially being able to use it to biamp by having the two separate 4 x 10 enclosures "together" and able to receive their own separate signal, or utilizing the full 8 x 10 ground shaking fury that Ampeg is known for! Glad I finally came back to Ampeg after years of trying other cabs that just can't match it. I would like to give a quick shout out to zZounds also, for their continued superior customer service when it comes to communication about your order etc., so you know exactly when to expect it on your door step. With the SVT cab mentioned above, it is delivered via freight, so get your hand truck ready, and the carrier that was used to deliver it to me was even courteous enough to have the driver call me personally, to let me know when he was 1/2 hour away from my home so I could watch for him. Just overall a great experience again from zZounds, as fortunately, I am a "repeat offender", and have utilized buying gear for years through them, without any issues at all. Thanks again and Rock On!                
Perfect, distinct Ampeg tone.  It fills the room and makes the crowd feel it in their core!                
The coolest feature aside from the tone is the wheels and push bar on the back.  Combined with the shape and foot holes at the top to saddle the amp, this monster is a dream to set up and tear down!  The Speakon connections are worry free and simple.                
It won't get any easier than this rig until Ampeg comes out with an inflatable model.                
It's built like a tank.  Treat it right and it will treat you right.  No worries about this thing falling apart or not standing up to road work.                
If you buy cheap, you'll buy twice.  Get this cabinet and your grandkids will be playing on it.                
No real experience here, but Ampeg's site and videos make shopping a breeze.  Left me with a clear choice.                
With this cabinet at the end of your cable, the crowd knows they're listening to a serious bass player.                
This is it; if you play live, you need this cabinet.  It's right at home next to a couple of Marshalls!                
I have owned Edens 2x10 cab, Fender Bassman 2x15, Peavey 2x10 1x18, a Line 6 LD400 with a Line 6 4x10 underneath and an Ampeg 4x10 cab. The Ampeg 8x10 is by far a better sounding cabinet.                 
Some comments I have read talk about the size and weight as a disadvantage, but to me, it is worth it for the difference in sound. Most bass cabinets are heavy anyway.                
Just plug it in and go.                
Superior construction and good solid components, built to take a beating.                
It may seem expensive, but comparable high quality cabinets cost as much if not more.                
No need for tech so far.                
Just the best bass cabinet in design and sound.                 
I really don't want any other amp, as this one is the best.                
its the best cabinet you can buy its worth every penny and its built to last forever!                
very responsive, great mids for cutting though the mix all while  retaining  that THUMP!!                
needs a tougher covering, I owned a svt 410 hlf  and it had same problem,                
no curve its a speaker cab it puts out what you dial in on your amp                 
looks amazing!!! just needs tougher covering                 
Its a tad expensive but oh so worth every penny                 
have not needed to                
Ya it an AMPEG look sweet on stage!!                
Wow I've played bass for 30+ years. owned many cabs and amps, I cant say enough about the sound AMAZING. the only thing I would like to see is tougher covering on cab it tears easy. its a tad heavy but it so worth it. the wheels and bar make it easy to roll around. I use an Ampeg SVT 7 PRO plenty of power for outside shows, you will  love the thump!!!!! this cab is amazing do yourself and favor and pick one up.                
I bought mine in Feb. 1990. I'm still giggin' with it today. I replaced the grill cloth because stuff happens. I replaced the speakers in '99 just because I wanted to. Out of all the different bass amps and cabinets I've tried, NOTHING, & I mean NOTHING comes close to the THUMP I get with this Cab.  And yes it does help that I have an Ampeg SVT II (1990) all tube 350watt head.                 
What else do you need. It has wheels, a push bar, and a input jack.                
I used this in the local club scene, as well as on the road. It's tough and rugged. It's a wonder Timex don't have stock AMPEG, but instead of "It takes a beatin and keep on tickin." they would say, " It takes a lumpin' and keeps on THUMPIN'!"                
Yes this product is on the upper price scale. I've had mine for 15 years now and I would get rid of it for ANYTHING!!!!!                
I needed to replace the emblem plate on the front. Mine was plastic and it had cracked. The company was great. Not only was I able to get a new plate quickly, I was able to get a metal one.  They rock!                
You can't mess with perfection. I don't want an amp that sticks out like a sore thumb on stage. I like to blend it into the shadows of the stage and let the people search for what in the world is that bass player playing through.                
FOREVER! 15 years and still going strong. The only thing I "don't like" is the weight. But that just goes with the great quality of the workmanship that goes into AMPEG!                
The tone is unbelievable. It is so loud it shakes you, and even at those extreme volumes, it still provides that lustrious tone ampeg is known for. The bass tones on it are unbelievable, the mids I dont ever really use, and the highs are punchy and loud. Speaking of loud, it is EXTREMELY loud! This amp can blast through both of my guitarist's half stacks easily. I use a the svt450 on it and its sounds great with my fender precision with round wound strings.                 
Im glad it is tolex instead of carpet because first of all, carpet just looks really tacky and cheap, and second of all, dog hair is horrible on carpetted amps. The wheels are the most useful things on this amp besides the speakers. It lets me simply and easily drag its massiveness onto stage with no cramps or hernias! The skid rails are great too.                
165lbs................                
Defanitely professional. Everything is still in place after dropping numerous times out of the trailer.                
$1400 is probably a bit too pricey for what its worth. I think 1000 is just fine. But seriousely, the tone is better than anything I have ever tried.                
I had a grand ol' time chatting with one of their employees.                
Um, when you touch its sexyness, the tolex is just a little sticky after hot shows in L.A.                 
Im glad I have this instead of hartke. Thats all I have to say. Thank you.                
After getting this Boom Box I asked myself why didn't I buy it sooner. The presence is so full sounding, and the response is so
immediate. This Cabinet will make your sound and playing better.
My Bandmates diffentially gave me smiles and nods of approval after playing just a few songs with it on the first day.                  
The reason I avoided getting one was the weight and size of it.
I found it easy to handle and not as heavy to lift as other Cabinets.
Reason being, the tilt back design with the high clearence wheels. Skid rails on the back if you encounter a few steps. This thing handles just like your rolling around a two wheeled Dolly. 
Lifting takes two people which is good. I always had to lift my 4 10 Cabinet alone and it's heavy by yourself. With the 8 10 someones always offering to help me lift it.                
The SVT IV PRO allows me a two different ways to connect the Cabinet.
Mono-bridge or Bi-amping between the 10's. I found I always went back to running Mono-bridge Mode. Having that additional Power seemed to work better for us in the mix. The soundman is combining the Backline and the Front sound together, I couldn't do that before with my Cabinets. Small or large Venues this Cabinet has sounded great.                  
I'd love to buy another one. The drummer said, one on each side of him would be just awesome. It's built like a Abrams Tank.
It's Big and Fast, and delivers a Powerful Punch, very imtimidating.
Anything good always has a good price. 
But, the value of being a bigger asset to the Band, is priceless.                   
Sad but true, when it was delivered it had a ding in the handle.
It didn't happen in shipping, it was assembled that way.
Arrangements where made and it was replaced.                
Years of gear changing has come to an end.
The SVT IV PRO with the SVT 810E works for me.                
no matter what sound you want, you're able to get it with this. You have a complete delivery of low-end frequencies as it gives all the high frequencies a bass guitar can reach.                
the handle bar and the skid rails and plate are really usefull, it helps preventing the cabinet from scratches and hits when loading/unloading it from whatever vehicle. the 2 tilt-back wheels help carrying this monster, while they let it stable when playing.                
the only thing i could reproach to the SVT-810e/av is that 165lbs is too heavy for this.                
really durable, everything is made and assembled with quality and precision                
for sure, this is the highest quality cabinet you can get on the market, but does is it really worth 1400$US? i think it's a bit too high.                
i never had experiences with it so i can't really tell, i'm not giving any note to this                
you'd be really almost scared to have 5 of these right in front of you                
as the grades are:  10 - the best, i chose it. the only one that could be considered better is the SVT-810 HPC,  just because it's 1500W rms  instead of 800.  for the rest i think it's clear: nothing's better than this earth moving bass bottom                
This is by far the best buy I have ever made .This amp is easy to use and  sounds great when put on top of an Ampeg svt-212 and hooked to a fender American pro jazz 4 or 5 with ernie ball flats. The folks here in the my part of the Hood county Texas know somebody is playing the bass.It doesn't have to be loud the tones that come out just move you.What a great product. thank you zZounds and Ampeg.                
The SVT has something that a SS bass amp will never have. The true sound of big tube power. That means great warm fat tone, rich with even order harmonics. When pushed the all tube front end will give you the sound that you have heard over and over again on recordings and live performances. A big sound with bite thats never sounds harsh and gets just the right amount of grit when you dig in with the pick or your fingers and the guitar volume full on. Back off your attack or roll back the volume and it cleans right up.                
You don't get a lot of fancy stuff like compressors or limiters.  What you do get is the famous Ampeg bass tone stack that other makers have tried to copy.  Two inputs (one padded) bass, mids (selectable freq), treble with ultra high and low boost switches.  An effects loop would be nice but I think once you play through one of these SVT heads you won't want or need effects.  The sound is just that good.                
The SVT will fight you every step of the way at first while you fuss with the gain and master volume. Forget the useless (for me) ultra low and hi switches. I set it pretty much flat and get the gain where where I like it, tweak the tone settings and fiddle with the gain again and then I set it where it breaks up a little and roll up the master.
It will take some time to dial it in.... but when you do, it's a great sound that never overpowers and sits in the mix just right. You get the sense that its there and you don't have to worry about it. You just have fun and play.                
It's an Ampeg!  This ones still made in the USA.  Built like a tank and weighs almost as much (85 lbs).  Every part of the amp looks like it's made from the best that could be had for what it needs to do.  The STV over the years has a proven track record on the road and on stages all over the world.  Provided parts are available, the thing could be used forever.  No backup amp need although keep a backup set of tubes.  Just in case.                
The SVT is at the top end of the price scale for a 300 watt amp.  However we are talking about a tube amp here.                
Unsure never had to call.  Ampeg is now owned by Loud Tech. so support still remains to be seen as far as Loud goes.                
Excuse Me!  This is an SVT! Who doesn't want one.                
I will keep it forever.  Its "the" bass sound.  Great classic tone for rock or blues.                
This is the thing that has defined my playing. the sonic quality is unbelievible. I have played many other rigs in my time but nothing has compaired to the SVT. things have come close but they always end up leaving a little to be desired. the only thing I can think might be better is the aquilar 680 and you still need a power amp with that and it costs just as much.                
everything a tube head should have and more.                
This thing is reliable. hasnt failed me in the 5 years I have owned it.                
for the money you cant get a better deal. as I said before aguilar might be better but you have to pay %250 more to get what this amp does.                
Havent had a problem yet but with other things ampeg has been great.                
come on its ampeg and its a classic.                
VERY satisfied with this. Been playing with it for years and it just keeps on pumping out the gloryious tube tone that is unatainable but solidstate anything.                
If you want classic Ampeg tone, you found it. I received mine on Friday, and did an outdoor gig on Sat. The sound and tone was awesome. I previously played through a Markbass 2x10 combo, with a hartke 115 on bottom. It sounded great, but I wanted to get that classic tone. After searching every  stomp box I could find, I realized you can't imitate true tube tone, without tubes. I paired the SVT Classic head with the SVT 410HLF cab. I play country and rock, and needed both bottom end and punchy tone. The sound is so even, you really dont need a comp. I did run a BBE sonic stomp on Saturday, although you prob. don't even need it. My Tech 21 VT Bass Deluxe sounds great with it too. Adds just enough grit for the rock tone I like.                 
Not a lot of extra's, but I don't really think you'll miss them. It sounds that good. There is a couple of pretty good videos on youtube that will give you some important info before you get yours, and will give you some pretty good sound clips. Search for SVT Heritage. It is the same head, just looks different.                
The Frequency knob confuses people. With Mid range set at 5 (or the 12 o'clock) position, you are neither boosting nor cutting the mids, so the Freq. selector knob doesn't do anything. You must boost or cut mids in order to hear what the Freqs. sound like. You will find YOUR sound. This thing is heavy. You will have to decide if heavy is worth your tone. For me, it was. It is also expensive, but again, sounds awesome !                
Only had a couple of days, but it seems to be built well.                
zZounds sells it for the same price as everyone else, except zZounds offers the payment plan.                
Hope I don't need them.                
Classic look...Nice. Looks nice sitting on stage !                
As long as it is reliable, it will be my amp of choice for a long time.                
The sound of this head is extemely classic. other solid state heads cant touch this one. The only thing that comes close to being "good" in comparison is a vintage accoustic head.                
pretty average sound the tone controls are unresponsive and when eq is set flat it sounds terrible....takes some work to set up and actually get a usable tone out of...even then it just doesnt have the best sound.
  it is loud at 300 watts but honestly at any thing above half volume the lower end begins to break down and really fall apart                
its a tube head...thats about it none of the qualitys that the old svt2 used to have. very unrelible until i switched mine out for an aguilar db 750 playing live shows was a nightmare and i was just waiting for it to blow...no cool compression or eq features                
its easy to turn on...awesome i jump for joy......not impressed                
id use most other cheaper heads over this if you want a real usa made  amp buy aguilar or much older ampeg...the newer ampeg is not at all what it used to be                
over priced and a waste of money                
i was soooo diapointed with this thing i just gave up and didnt contact them.....not there fault                
looks cool but looks aint everything                
it took me 5 months to be saick of this thing                
Even at quiet settings the rich yet restrained harmonies from the 4-valve preamp are alive.  This amp has the most incredible musical sounds that a bass amp can give.  And when cranked it sounds thunderous, no other word for it.  Even at its most heavily distorted it is pleasing on the ears.  Yet the beast can also play the cleanest, sweetest sounds with incredible accuracy.                 
2 channels can be blended for even thicker tube sound and greater tonal control.  The rocker switches give instant tonal changes on the fly, great for gigging, while keeping it all very simple.                
Turn it on, get incredible sounds.  Only a handful of knobs and switches means that any player can access the right tone with little effort.                  
Great quality, the thing will last for ever.  However as with most new tube amps it ships with fairy average sounding tubes.  The tubes are where the sound is made, so do yourself a favour and get some good quality preamp and power tubes.  You'll need 14 tubes in total!!                
This amp is worth whatever they decide to charge for it.  It is simply incredible.  By all accounts it sounds exactly like the original, and that is something that has never been beaten.                
I sent them a technical question on retubing but didn't receive an answer that day; however I haven't had any real problems to deal with them.                
This is like being invited into the real musician's club.  Or having your first beer.  Or like hearing music from your bass for the first time.                
This is THE bass guitar amplifier.  From sweet, musical ringing resonance, crystal clear yet mellow highs, unmatched mids on command at three frequency ranges, to incredible thunderous presence when cranked, there has never been an amp that matched the original SVT until now - the vintage reissue.  I have had mine a week and I am still gobsmacked.  If you are looking at spending serious dollars on a bass head, there is absolutely nothing else worth looking at.                
The SVT-VR amp Rocks, plain and simple. Been playing 50 years, owned many amps, but this is by far the best sounding of them all, BUT let me tell a story.
I bought the amp on the payment plan. No hassles, smooth deal. Amp arrived the next day (Wow). Uncrated it and set it up on the 810 box, It kept looking crooked!
Figured out the grill cloth was installed cockeyed. Contacted ZZ and Ampeg.
The return emails were flying. Apologies, offers, concerns, techs calling (again, Wow!)
Come to find out the grill was affixed with Velcro pads. I pushed it loose and reseated it. That simple, but the support and concern by both ZZ and Ampeg was outstanding. These people are straight up honest, and dedicated to their customers.
The amp is expensive, you can't say it isn't. But after playing this beast, you will soon understand why you did it.                 
The sound all cabinets aspire to.  That classic tone from the past, that nothing else can touch.                
The wheels and handle help manage this beast.  Without them it would be almost impossible.  Still...this cabinet is not for the faint.                
Pay less...get crap.  Your choice, not mine.                
With everything else I've owned (Hartke, Sunn, Carvin, Fender), you "pays your money you takes your chances."  Not with Ampeg,                
Hasn't broken yet...the best support I know of, not needing any.  :D                
If you're looking for hot chicks...this thing will help you work out and build muscles, but it won't attract any.  It's an amp, not a magic lamp.
But if you're looking for the best sound around...if tone and musicality is what you're trying to achieve, this cabinet paired with an Ampeg SVT-VR is a sure thing.                
Until I cannot handle it anymore, it will be my gig amp.  After that...well, it will sit in my basement and be my practice amp until I die or cannot play any more.  Life's too short, why settle for less?                
this tube amp sounds just like an ampeg should.It's a loud 100 watts.I've gigged it 3 times now and it seems to be improving each time.I went from 575 watts ss to this and was worried it couldn't keep up but it does in spades.I play a 5 string Am standard p bass with 2 TL 606 15 cabinets loaded with eminence drivers.                
The sound is SVT quality all the way. For those who love SVT tube tone, this has it in spades. And even though it is 1/3 the wattage of the 300w SVT, it can get plently loud, believe me. However, because of the lower wattage, and the updated controls (the new V4-B has a gain control), I can get that awesome cranked SVT grind at much lower volume levels.                
The V4-B is about half the weight of my SVT Classic (which makes it much easier to move around), and is rated at 100 watts, about a third of the SVT Classic. Although cosmetically, it is more of a match for the SVT AV cab, or the newly available 112 and 212 cabs, it still looks great sitting on my SVT 610 HLF Cab. I would like to see a V4-B in the Classic black cosmetics to match better, but it's close enough, and still looks great.  Ampeg has updated the control panel features a bit, which is a good thing in my opinion. Instead of the original identical dual inputs, there is one regular, and one  -15 dB for active basses. Also, instead of dual volume controls, there is gain and volume, which enables the player to get that SVT- like grind without having to max out the volume, a good thing, definitely.  The rest is about the same; ultra-hi, ultra-lo, and 3-freqency mid selector rocker switches above a three-band eq. which gives an ample amount of tone control. The back of the amp now has a balanced line out with ground lift which the original didn't have, and it has the usual pre-amp, and slaves outs, and power amp in. There is also 5  speaker outs for any speaker configuration you may have. I wish it had a speak-on connector, though, which is my preference over that 1/4" jack connections. However, the lack of a speak-on is probably because it's a 100w amp, rather than 300w or above, when it's more usual to see speak-ons.   Another thing to note is that this amp also lacks a cooling fan, which means it is dead quiet when turned on, which can be great in a recording environment. The chassis of the amp can also get quite hot after a few minutes of operation, though; this doesn't seem to be a problem, but it's something to be aware of.  There are no extra's like overdrive, etc. but the tone of the amp really makes up for any lack of features, in my opinion. You can use pedals for any other features you may want.                 
The controls are pretty straight-forward and simple (which I like), similar to an SVT Classic; you can get your preferred tone very quickly.                 
Unlike the original V4-B, although designed in the USA, this new one is manufactured in China.  I know this poses a problem for some who think only American made Ampegs are any good.  Although, I would love to see Ampeg go American in their manufacturing again, I think they are doing an overall good job in maintaining the quality control with the Chinese made products. All the Ampeg products I now own (I own quite a few) were made in either Korea or China, and the quality level and control is very good, and they've performed flawlessy for me.  It's amusing to me to hear people blasting Ampeg for it's Chinese manufacturing, and yet go out and get the latest Chinese made Apple product without batting an eye! Granted, not everything made in China is great, just like not everything made in America is great. So far, though, I've been pleased with the Ampegs made there. The V4-B appears to be a quality, well-made product, and has performed flawlessly for me in the short time I've had it. And based on what I've experienced with other Ampeg products, I expect it will continue to be great for a long time to come.                
I think this Ampeg is a good value for what it is: an all tube tone box, a veritable little brother to the SVT VR or Classic.  It appears to be high quality. Some may feel it's priced too high for a Chinese-made product, but I think if it were made in America, it would be priced a lot higher. So as long as the quality control is there, I feel the product is good value.                
I've called Ampeg tech support for different questions about their products, and I've always found them to be very responsive and helpful.                
Great Ampeg vintage sound and vibe...wow!!                
I was really excited to see Ampeg come out with a re-issue of this great head, so of course I had to jump at the chance to get one. After playing through it over the last month I can say that it is everything I was hoping for.  Great SVT tube tone,  but with half the weight of my full size SVT Classic head. And even though it is less powerful than my SVT classic (100w compared to 300w) it can get plenty loud.                
Ive had this amp for a few months with the intention of running guitar it easily does it. Clean is loud but not overbearing like most high gain guitar amps. Amp takes pedals like a dream. This amp is super loud wether bass or guitar the tone is there at loud volume however if you intend to record quiter it needs a little dial in here and there but not much at all. Im running it through a 4x12 8 ohm cab with celestion g12t-70s pretty good combo with any celestion but so far i have the tone ive been searching for forever. Anyone looking for a powerfull clean amp and running low tuned guitars (B or lower) should definitely try this amp.                
This amp is nothing but awesome.  The amp/cab match is perfect and sound amazing.  Best bass amp purchase I've ever made...ever!                
I'll start by saying that I've tried three of these amps to date. I know I'll be bucking the trend here, but they really leave a lot to be desired in terms of tone. I've gotten better tone out of a $400 Class "D" amp, to be honest. I'm guessing Ampeg figured they could sell these on nostalgia and retro styling alone. Let me clear, I WANTED to like this amp so badly. I had already purchased an SVT-212AV cabinet and really liked the idea of having a tube head to match it. Unfortunately, the V-4B reissue really lacks in the tone department. I've played an American Precision and Precision Bass Deluxe (P/J pickups) and the sound coming out of this amp was just disappointing. Sure, it got loud enough to compete with a drummer and two hard rock guitarists, but I always found myself tweaking the tone in search of definition and clarity. I like a bit of overdrive in my tone, but the grit coming out of the V-4B just sounded farty and generic. The same can be said for the clean tones, as well. Maybe I'm being too picky, but I drove myself crazy trying to dial in a pleasing tone. Bottom line: If retro looks and volume are your thing, then the V-4B might be for you. I would wait, however, until you can find a deal. Do not pay full price for this amp, because it will not hold its resale value. If, on the other, hand, you are looking for more pleasing tones and smoother overdrive, go for a Fender Bassman 100T.                
Transparent and flat.                
Routing, clocking, and sound.                
Relatively easy once everything is installed.                
Built tough. Brushed metal housing a quality connectors.                
Great value, especially considering the quality and flexibility (up to 32 output channels!).                
Haven’t used it yet,                
Very appealing. Looks good, sounds good, very low latency.                
Great interface. After installing the software and registering (which is, honestly, the most excruciating part), the Discrete 8 really has shown it’s flexibility and clarity.The mic preamps are clean and quiet. Not what I’d call characterful, but definitely transparent, even pushing a Shute SM7b. Routing is easy once you’ve figured out the control panel.Conversion seems to be on par with my Apogee and Lynx, though in comparison the Apogee is a little rounder, whereas the Antelope is a little more flat, at least to my ears.Antelopes clocking is definitely one of the best parts of this interface. Slaving other converters is a breeze, and the clock runs incredibly stable. Subjectively, it sounds to me like a veil was lifted off the audio and the high frequency info is more apparent, especially at 96Khz. Eventually I may upgrade again, but at the moment Antelope has really impressed me. Even if an upgrade happens, I’m happy to know I am still able to incorporate the Discrete 8 into my studio.                
At first, I was a bit confused with the setup of this product. I have the newest macbook pro with usb-c only. I had used a hub to connect my interface with. It would keep shutting off and restarting or the audio would skip in and out. This is apparently a know problem with usb hubs and antelope audio. After dishing out some more cash for Firewire and a single dedicated adapter, I've loved this product. It sounds so good where it really counts. I've used apogee and focusrite interfaces before. This is one of the best sounding. Though there was a slight learning curve, I love this product.                
only tip is keep making the best                
the effects are real i have waves slate ik multimedia dont get me wrong i like all those too i put antelope right up there with them thats saying a whole lot                
its a little too learn but just go to YouTube                 
yes yes yes                
yes                
everything they suppose to do and more                
the sound of my bass and fender roads coming through it                
i have always brought motu interfaces this is my first antelope i love it will always buy there tec service was the best                 
'm simply LOVING the Zen Tour. It's marketed as a portable device, but it has all the I/O I need for my small studio. Of course, the best thing about it is the sound! Pristine conversion, silent operation, gorgeous sound and plugins; you've engineered a beautiful circuit here.  
I had to adjust the crossover settings on my monitors to compensate for the bass response! Now I'm competitive with larger studios all iWho'd have imagined a box like this would ever exist just a few years ago! 
Oh, and of course, it's portable!
Only criticism is the lack of word clock out. But, I suppose that is on par with the price point. It's just sad not to get Antelope clocking throughout my whole rack! Hence, the 4 stars on features. Overall, this thing is a game changer! You won't be able to get mastering grade conversion and sound for close to this price. 
Also, zZounds is the best!                
Everything about this interface is amazing. I’ve dealt with antelope before because most of the studios I’ve been in has an Orion 32. This interface is unbelievably amazing.                
Bought... and Returned... Great sounds, features sound good, but nurfed performance on Windows due to not wanting to put in the work to make good Windows drivers. From their own FAQ "There are no plans to implement ThunderBolt support for Windows at this time. However, if there are recurrent questions about it and requests for it to be implemented, we will forward it as a suggestion to our development teams." I'm not paying for a sports car Audio Interface to drive it slow only on sundays... UAD has Windows Thunderbolt support... Sorry Antelope, great interface, handcuffed by you..                
If this is your first step into the “pro grade” audio interface territory than I cannot recommend any interface over this one. The reason you should be choosing this interface over alternatives from UA/Focustite/Presonus is the Clocking and AD/DA converters. These converters and clock work harmoniously to ensure that no matter what you record it will both go in and out of the box with perfect detail and clarity. Calling these converters “musical” is an understatement. This device is also stocked with their FPGA effects system that you access through the antelope control software. These effects (ranging from BAE 1073s, to STA-LEVEL, and any SSL eq you could dream for, not mentioning about 30 other compressors and EQs) all sound amazing and are truly a way to record straight into the box with anything you might need. This box is perfect and it amazes me everyday.                 
I ordered 2 of this because I wanted to go wireless. The range: pretty standard for most Bluetooth 4 series but you get a safe 50 ft distance. Quality: for the most part it will depend on your audio source and speakers but audio meets expectations of HD. Pairing: very easy to pair to a source and easy to link this two units for a stereo like music.(its mono but with two sides) Batery: this is where I think they are way behind, as a new product they stated that it can go UP TO 8 hours, reality is that you can get 7 and 6 if full volume from source, so 5 hours new & guñly charged you can count on that, but knowing that a mist gigs are testing and low volume for pre events etc. Definitely a down point this will kill this wonderful divice. Please make it at least 16 hours because once it gets older battery performance will decrease.                
They need to add low latency to it and it might work for karaoke. The music sounds good but it produces too much delay with vocals that it's almost useless.                
Great for bars and smaller venues when you want to spread out the sound without cranking your speakers. Outside, it's awesome when you have a clear shot from TX to RXs. Daisy-chained more loudspeakers on the business side of the units to cover about an acre with clear, crisp audio. Worked less effectively in an area with heavier vegetation. If you use this to EXPAND or COMPLIMENT your hard-wired set up, I am sure you will see the value in this product.                
I purchased this Alto Stealth Wireless System and the first time was a charm, Second time I was getting static tried different channels the same, So I ran XLR cables instead, tested in my own back yard 3 times, and could not get it to work properly even after changing channels per instructions.  It works but periodically the volume would go down when someone would walk between the speaker and the transmitter and gets periodically a static noise.  Between different attempts, I was afraid to use it at a couple of wedding receptions and ceremonies as I was convinced that the static noise would suddenly come and go right at the " I do " moment. Either I have a defective unit or this is how they work.  I tried contacting the manufacturer and so far no response.  I will sell the Alto Stealth wireless system for what ever I can get and take my losses. Until I sell it I will keep testing it and keep trying to contact the manufacturer.  In summary, I don't trust it and afraid to use it at an important event.  If you still happen to buy one test it right away and don't wait like I did to test it and not be able to send it back to Zzounds. Hope this helps!                
This is awesome!!!!!  I have used this system 4 times since I bought it and it is perfect!!!!!  I have used it out doors twice and indoors twice and it just works perfect!!!!!!  Used it on 2 - QSC K-12s  and 2- Bose L-1 Compacts.  Nothing but great sound!!!!                
For the price, they are great! As with most wireless devices, they are better and more dependable indoors. I have tested them both indoors, and outdoors as well as through walls, and they work extremely well up to 150-175 feet. There have been a few interference glitches where the music fades, or cuts out for a second, but that is only when I push the range.                
I've used this the same week I bought it. I've used it up to 200' maybe 250' with no issues. Very easy to use right out the box.                
I am very pleased with this wireless system and zZounds services. I will continue doing business zZounds.                 
So I read a lot of reviews and decided it was worth a try. I tried it in a ballroom with 700+ kids and had zero drop outs. The speakers were about 150-200 ft from the transmitter. Tried it at a wedding in a tent when the speaker was about 10 feet away from the transmitter and it would “pop” and drop out for a second from time to time. Over 5 hours it probably did it 15 times. The wind was a steady breeze so I’m sure that might have had something to do with it, but it was disappointing that it would do that so close. So it’s good for indoors, but I’m not using it again outdoors.                  
Use this system to set up a monitor link that was hard wired and somehow got terminated. Used the transmitter and one receiver and it works perfectly.This wireless system is very versatile on how it can be used. I may have to get a few of these to speed up my hookup time when I do sound re-enforcement with bands.                
This is a remarkable product for the price point. If you don't mind them cutting out occasionally then I'd say go for it. The next best option you're going to find is going to cost you 4x as much and you're only going to gain the extra 2-4%. 
Having wireless speakers is a game changer. Just keep in mind that you can't scan for a clear channel before using them so you're rolling the dice every single time. For me personally, having peace of mind and confidence in my equipment is very important so I ultimately went with Sennheiser after using these Alto's a few times. Still a remarkably good product for the price.                 
This product is very unpredictable and does not live up to what it says it can do. It seems to work best only when there is a clear line of sight meaning the system must be in the same room to work half way decent and to me I can run cable for all that. Dependability is way more important than time in my book. This system should only be used in emergency situations.                
Admittedly I should have done more research before impulsively purchasing this system for a multi room gig last summer.. but I didn't, and I rush shipped it... and it failed me right out of the box... at the worst possible time.. thank god I had a plan B ... Human Bodies absorb RF energy. when working and somebody walks past there is drop out.. put a ton of people between the receiver & sending units.. with cell phones.. and forget it.. waste of good $$$$$ maybe it will be good for a non professional situation where my reputation isn't on the line.                 
I purchased the initial Alto wireless speaker transmitter and receivers a few months ago. They have performed perfect. Clear sound and simple set up. The expansion packs allowed me to simplify hookup further. Front of house on one channel and Subs on the other. WORKS GREAT! I highly recommend this system.                
I have been trying for years to get a small monitor with enough power to be heard. We are a loud AC/DC tribute band. I have tried every 8-10 inch monitor out there that is reasonably priced and nothing cuts through. I bought one of these to give it a try and MAN it really worked well. Sound man used a X32 board I had the monitor on about 9 o'clock and it really came through. It was one of our louder clubs. I will be buying 3 more. Small, light weight and powerful. Only negative for me as with most speakers is in monitor mode the angle on the floor is not tilted up enough don't know why these manufacturers angle speakers so it hits you in the shins instead of the ears/face. Also if you try to tilt it more by wedging something under it the XLR cord gets in the way so I am going to use a 90 degree XLR that should fix it.                
This Interface is amazing! Glad i made the switch, my recordings are cleaner and sounding better than ever. Great price for what you actually get with this device.                
This interface hands down, is the best quality sounding interface i owned compared to Tascam, M-Audio, Avid and MOTU! when I plugged this in for the first time I immediately heard everything Ive been mission in sound quality!!!! I also own the apogee mic 96K and plan to upgrade to the plus model as well!! zZounds thank you for making this possible for me own this phenominal product with your easy payment plan!!!                
I went from a Fast Track Pro to the Apogee Duet. The sound immediately became noticeably clearer. I am very impressed with the build, and acoustic quality of the Duet. As far as the mobility... it can fit in any travel bag. Two words to best describe it is, quality and simplicity. I'm purchasing another one                
i tried all the other interfaces 1200 and under. wayyyy better glad i spent the extra.the adjusting levels on screen is simple . i like that better . .no looking back and forth at inter face and screen.good idea apogee                
So my apollo twin mk2 because I became more focused on getting a good sound out of it than actually writing anything. I decided, for the sake of my writing, that i'd get a no nonsense no frills usb microphone so I can focus on the only important thing. The music. This mic is smaller than you think. I'd say maybe an inch taller than a credit card and two thirds the width of one. It is plug and play (make sure you set your preferences to use this mic as your sound card) and easy to use when you follow the quick start manual. Mic is sturdy, with good weight. It doesn't feel like a hollow plastic mic as some in this category tend to be. The sound can only be described as "Solid". It is not hyped in anyway not is it overly bassy. Apogee did an awesome job with this capsule. The recording quality is clear and everything you need to make a great recording. This isn't just "Demo" good. I believe one can make a radio ready song with this mic (with the right knowledge). On acoustic guitar this mic is as accurate as it gets. Very clean and detailed sounding. On vocals it is the same. Not overly flattering but not lacking either. Just very accurate. Overall I give this mic 5 stars because it delivers on what it promises. I give 4 stars to its sound because it is accurate and solid but feel like 5 stars Is fitting if I felt the mic added something extra to the sound. If that's what you want then you may want to look elsewhere. I highly reccomend this bad boy to anyone looking to record with ease without sacrificing quality.                
I've been using Apogee product for about 10 years in music production because of the clear AD converters and this mic is very clear and superb quality for such a small mic and it gives me the portability to use it with my Ipad pro for mobile recording.                 
The performance II's are the best sounding heads I've come across in my lifetime of playing the drums.  They are durable, and have a great punch and make the tone of my drums something everyone complements.  I've used them live and in the studio, and nothing compares, not Remo, and certainly not Evans.  I've tried them all and let me tell you, if you want a professional sound in a drum head that you don't have to change out every couple of weeks because they cant take the pounding, these are the heads you want.  You won't be disappointed.                   
These Aquarian Performance 2 Clear Drumheads leave my drums sounding just right. No overtones and plenty of projection!  Absolutely "Perfect for Live or Studio"!  No Problem for any sound engineer with these heads!  For ME they're perfect.                  
I love these drum heads, They make an old cheap kit sound amazing. A lot of "Bang" for your buck.                
I used Evans heads for many years, after trying the Aquarian triple threat snare head I contacted a rep for Aquarian he told me to try the performance 2 head that was 3 years ago and I haven't looked back these heads have a great attack and it doesn't take much to get the perfect sound out of them if you are looking for a great head for your Tom's this is the way to go                
This is an awesome head. I bought it to put on my Mapex 22x16 Pro M bass. It's a maple shell and I wanted to play it without any of the add on dampeners. You know, no pillow or blanket or other gadgetry. I installed the Regulator on the resonant side along with an Aquarian Super Kick II (purchased from Zzounds at the same time). What a difference. I put the heads on, tuned them with a drum dial to 75 on the reso side and 78 on the batter. Wow! It sounds incredible. I am not using any other dampeners at all and the drum sounds like a bass guitar playing a really low note. So musical it's hard to believe. I now own the best sounding bass I ever heard. I've got a cheaper Mapex set that is a birch hybrid. I can't wait to try these heads out on it. Don't hesitate to by this head. You will be amazed!!                
it's a head...                
Put it on and play...                
Great looking easy to seat.                
Worth every penny.                
Reliable. No need to deal with the company.                
This is all I need                
I have used this resonant bass head on all of my drums for the past 10 years with the Aquarian  Super Kick II and I absolutely love the sound of these heads.  I currently have them on a Pearl 18X22 and a Tama !8X14.  Both sound amazing and Zzounds is amazing with their fast shipping and great pricing.  Love these guys and will do business with them again.  A lot of people carry the 22'' head but Zzounds was the only place that has 18'' heads.  Love This Product and this company.                 
I put this head a on relatively cheap bass drum today. I'm almost speechless. It sounds so good (with zero other muffling) that I had to write a review to make sure others know. 
I tuned it low and the resonant head just barely above it; It's 100% attack with plenty of "whoomf" to boot. It doesn't ring. It's probably perfect for recording, though MAYBE a little dry for live playing.
My guitarist looked at me after we played our first song and said "That bass drum is amazing. I can feel it in my chest."                
The muffling ring works. It was easy to tune (I did use a drum dial, but it was one time around to get close, one rotation to fine tune; total about 2 minutes)                
Put it on, crank it up. Thump.                
It's a thick drum head. I imagine it will last a long time.                
This head is pretty cheap compared to some other bass drum heads and it sounds awesome. You don't have to worry about your pillowing touching the head just right, or whether it moves when you beat on your drum.                 
haven't needed them.                
It's a drum head. It's not really sexy, but i guess with a clear drum head on the front it looks interesting to see the ring from the audience perspective.                
I'll beat a hole in it before I give it up.                
Over many years of playing and giging, the Super-Kick II has become my favorite batter side bass drum head.  Paired with the Aquarian Force II resonant side head, the sound is unbeatable.  No other damping is required.  Pull all that junk out of the inside of your kick drum and give it the sound it should have.                
Aquarian Super-Kick ll Bass Drum Heads are, in my opinion, the BEST kick heads on the market !! I've tried them all,and MY choice is the "Super-Kick ll ". Takes care of the overtones without sacrificing Depth, Clarity, & Punch !!                
I just purchased an aquarian super kick II drumhead, and sound is so deep and rich it sounds like a cannon,, its the best bass drumhead i have ever used,, and it sounds even better when miced.                
This head will make any kick drum sound great!                
I can't say enough about this drum head. It makes my drum sound fantastic. I was able to tune my Kick drum without any pillows or blankets or other junk in my drum. It sounds so musical I can't describe it. I paired it with a Regulator front head and it just has to be heard to be believed. I bought a second super Kick II for another set I have and will be buying a third one soon. I will probably never even try another head. The Aquarian Super Kick II, in my opinion, is the best there is!                
It's a head                
Simple, simple. I do recommend using a drum dial tuner but it's certainly not necessary.                 
Put a kick spot on it and it might last for years.                 
Worth way more than the price.                
Never needed to contact the company.                
Sex appeal? It's a drum head, dude.                
I may never try anything else.                 
IT REALLY WORKED, ELIMINATE BUZZING SOUNDS AND GAVE A DEEPER TONE. FORGET ALL THE MUFFLING PADS AND TAPES AND USE THE STUDIO RINGS VERY EASY TOO USE. ORDERD 9-25-13 DELIVERD IN 3 DAYS                
Excellent sound quality. I doubt anything could sound much better at three times the cost or more. Hook it into your word clock synced with your DAW and if you're not happy with that you either need to spend a lot more money or something is missing in your studio playback system.                
More features that you can possibly imagine, they pretty much covered every use scenario on this unit                
With this many features, there is a learning curve but having separate buttons and controls for each feature makes it easy and convenient to operate once you get used to it.                
All metal chassis and cover, well made and all knobs and buttons look very sturdy for heavy use. I have had absolutely no problems with the unit operationally.                
Excellent value for what you get.                
Not needed them, they seem to be attentive on the various forums and thier site deals with questions well.                
It's an interface, a good one at that. If you bought it for its looks you are probably not that serious about recording. It's a tool and compared to other tools of this nature it does a great job... OK, it looks cool too.                
I read the reviews, viewed videos and decided I would purchase this unit. I've had it for several months and I own several other interfaces to compare it to, including an Apollo Twin Duo. Quite frankly, it sounds as good or better than the Apollo and has a lot more flexability of use. As for the heat issue, It's been discussed at legnth on forums and my experience shows it to be just a couple of degrees warmer than the Twin operates. There is absolutely no danger of injury from touching the unit and I can hold it with both USB and A/C adapter plugged in operating headphones and at pretty high output. Not a problem holding it in my hand or resting my hand on top of it while working. I live in Florida, my studio is not that cold so I doubt it's going to be a problem. Converters are awesome, it's an neat unit for portable operation and it will work stand alone. Only complaint I have is the automatic input selector. If you plug in a mic cord, a mic input is automatically selected. I would like to see a manual overide so that you could manually swith to a line input without using a 1/4 TRS connector. Software is great, unit is well built with quality components and connectors and I'm keeping it in the arsenal. I love the Apollo as well and between the two, there isn't much you couldn't do. Definately a thumbs up.                
Love this interface.  Loses it's direction on PC so have to go into Windows audio window and make corrections so it grabs drivers.  Other than that it is wonderful.                
I was incredibly excited to pick this unit up after seeing it at Summer NAMM.  The excitement was short lived.  The unit gets INCREDIBLY hot, to the point that it would cause pain if touched and would heat up cables and dongles attached to it.  After just three days the buttons on the unit became unresponsive, even when triggered via the control software.  Most reviews online follow the same details. I picked up a Universal Audio Apollo Twin instead.                
The Beatstep Pro is easily the best purchase I’ve made in a long time. This controller has a ton of uses/functionality. I personally use it as a drum machine within Ableton. You have a pad on the beatstep pro assigned to a pad within ableton and trigger your drums sounds using the beatstep pros step sequencer. If you want to use your own drum sounds in your daw, I don’t know a better option. Thanks zZounds!                
While the DrumBrute isn't be all, end all drum machine it does a great job of being an classic X0X box with pretty darn good analog sound. And lots of voices! A lot of people are not fans of the first kick voice--I'm not either, on its own. However it is fantastic to layer as a top kick, to beef up the snare or layer under the clap. I love the hats, they unforgivingly dirty. All the other voices--even the zap, which when pitched down makes a fine little perc sound--find their way into my tracks consistantly. The DrumBrute sound is DRY. Much like other analog instruments. Much like the MicroBrute. Most of the time I end up using a lot of processing; however, the DrumBrute voices take to lots of processing very well. If you already have some good saturation, distortion, etc you can get a lot of different textures out of the DrumBrute.The master swing has a really nice groove to it + swing per track + individual track lengths + "note nudge" means you can really get some pretty natural grooves going. There is a lot unsaid here (invidual outs, master out multi mode filter, rolls/stutter, etc). For my money this is way more interesting than the TR-8.Just a note about my star ratings below. I gave the "sound" category a slightly low rating because some of the voices do have a limited sweet spots on the parameters--the DrumBrute isn't a sound deisgn power house. "Wow Factor" was low-ish because...well...I've owned and used a lot of drum machines. The DrumBrute didn't come crashing out the gate with unheard of features. But it is a workhorse drum machine that'll work for many people. If you want to get started making House or Techno and don't want to use a computer, you could do far, far worse than choosing a DrumBrute as a first drum machine.                
The DrumBrute is not a clone of any drum machine that I know of, and that uniqueness is what makes it such an interesting piece of gear. It is very well-constructed (solid, sturdy). The immediacy of the functions make it extremely fun to jam on and for playing live. Having individual outs expands the sonic potential which is great, since the sweet spots for each sound do seem a little elusive at times. Kick 1 and the snare are probably the weakest sounds, but sending through their separate outs can quickly remedy that.  Being truly analog, there's no saving of knob settings so I tend not to get caught up in the "how can I recall/recreate this live" way of thinking. Plenty of pattern/song memory though. It's also fun to trigger drum kits in a DAW (I use Ableton drum racks) since the pads send midi, and the note repeat/random functions also work via midi. It'd be nice if you could pan each sound you could apply the filter to your entire programmed sequence (which you can't do when using the individual I/O), but this is a minor gripe and at this price point you can't expect to have everything. For serious/experienced drum machine types, this may tend to seem like a less-serious option or something that would be nice to have second-hand, but if this is your first drum machine or if you're looking for a well-built, unique, and fun drum machine at a great price the DrumBrute is an excellent choice.                
The drumbrute was disappointing. Mine has something large and loose inside the case which prompted me to return it. So I can't say if mine was functioning properly, however I can say this: Unlike other Arturia products, the case is plastic, given the price that isn't unreasonable. The filter is supposed to be the same as the Minibrute, but the in both the high and low pass modes the sweep is minimal and the resonance is almost non-existant. Perhaps that was due to mine being defective. However given the limitations of the analog voices, your tone shaping options are very limited with the filter being marginally functional. The pads were also not responsive, the would only trigger 3 out of 5 times, and frequently double triggered. The note repeat function also failed to engage fifty percent of the time. The sequencer, which was the main point of interest for me, worked quite well, although the last step didn't always engage either. It is still remarkable they could make an analog drum machine for the price, but don't expect too much from it.                
The DrumBrute Impact for the price alone and features is worth getting. More punch on the kick and snares, the fm drum and distortion are amazing and the color feature is a game changer for this new DrumBrute.                 
i bought this because it looked like a great controller for the included software. 
i'd say it's a nice kb. feels better then a standard 49 key m-audio cheapie. 
the included software is great and the tight integration of the keyboard controls with the software is fantastic. 
for me this is a keeper and i'm selling off my other controllers and keyboards since i only need one good one to control software synths.                
Being almost completely unfamiliar with midi controllers, I will admit that I fretted with understanding what it all meant. 
I've been producing electronic music, very prolifically, for the past year or more. I was so used to plugging in 1/4 jacks from my synths into my interface and just recording directly into my DAW (Adobe Audition). It just worked.
But I new I needed more. I felt boxed in with my main go-to synth, and was running dry on ideas. That's what drew me to the Artuia Key-Lab. 5000 more sounds bundled in the package was a major selling point. 
But I was unsure how to get everything recording ready. This package came bundled with Ableton Live 9 Lite, so as a shot in the dark I downloaded it. 
Being new to the controller and DAW it was a bit of a headscratcher. But once I got everything ironed out it's not left center stage of my desk since. 
The key action is phenomenal for the price point, and pads and knobs and faders feel really good. If you need something more and especially new sounds, then this may be what you're looking for. 
I'm still studying it and putting it through its paces, but I feel like I got way more than what I paid for. 
I still love my old way of recording synths but I feel like this will prove to be the machine that will allow more growth and development in sound as an artist.                
I just received this today and it is very nice. I was using the Arturia Essentials 61 which isn't bad at all for the price but this mkii is much nicer. The keybed (semi weighted) is very nice and extremely responsive. The keys feel very sturdy unlike the Essentials line and it has aftertouch which the former also does not. It integrates even better with Analog Lab 3 and V Collection 6. I am currently running Reason 10 and it works much better than the Essentials for my DAW as well but it still doesn't recognize Reason as it does other DAWs to my understanding which is something Arturia should really consider and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 on ease of use. That being said, setting up my configs wasn't too much of a hassle. I have to say Arturia really nailed it with this controller. You want find anything close to it at its price point Well Done Arturia.                
Very nice build, great keybed. Huge step up from my Essentials 61. Seamless integration with V 6 collection/Analog Lab. Wish Arturia would focus more with integrating better with Reason but the configuration wasn't too bad to map. Arturia really hit it out of the park with this one.                
I recently purchased this awesome keyboard from zZounds music and have to say I am thrilled with it. I've heard some say the action is too heavy and others say it's too light. I've been playing my whole life and even though it may be a tad on the heavy side it plays beautifully. The key feel and sensitivity response are perfect. Out of the box and set up took me just over an hour. I'm using sonar platinum and have had no problems at all. I've yet to really dig into the control features and pads/knobs etc. but all I wanted really was a good quality controller that felt like a real piano. I got that and then some. Thanks again zZounds music for all that you do. Very satisfied.                
I bough this blemished from zZounds. However, there isn't a blemish on it and it was sparkling new, even factory plastic sealing keys etc everything intact. As it was preowned and returned it was registered to someone else, but zZounds and Arturia had that fixed in less than 2 weeks. I wanted a controller to control hardware synthesizers and while the assignability of controls on KeyLab can be complicated it is not unfathomable. I have gotten inside separate synthesizers programmed the KeyLab pads as program changes in each synth. However, I cannot get one buton access to each synth yet. This is easy to do in Analog Lab software that comes with this, so if I absolutely get stuck I will try Arturia support who again was right there about getting registration straightened out.  This is by far the best keyboard I have played on, is very sturdily constructed, and is just super far out and a very prfessional Midi controller, very premium quality. Again no problem being blemished, just saved me money.                 
I really enjoyed this product the keyboard came well built no problems what so ever opening the package at first look I love it's design the color it's well built metal and wood this thing is sturdy and it's the lightest 88 key keyboard I've had now turning on the device it lights up turns on and you get 9 faders 10 knobs 16 pads it is the complet workstation it's better than any midi controller out there on the market it really is now the key bed I have nothing but good things to say about to keybed best keybed on any controller by far it feels great under your fingers I own a Roland RD 64 and it has ivory weighted keys these keys feel almost as great the ivory is slightly better not by much the keys are great it comes with analog lab pianoteq5 uvi workstation Steinway model D I loved this product and encourage all of you that read this to get it worth the buy                 
For the money, it's a steal. The keys are small, but feel good and are much more playable than say a MicroKorg. I really like that I can take it wherever I go. The step sequencer is pretty cool too. I don't really care for pads on MIDI controllers, so I'm glad that Arturia went a different route with this.                 
First, it is important to realize that this is a monosynth with some interesting features such as variable waves that can be used in a lot of ways. I suggest using a simple approach when first making a basic sound then experimenting once you figure out the layout. The filters seem to have some very nice ways of fitting in, routing a signal to one or the other or both is a simple thing. I find the audio range to be suitable for  a lot of variation. I would say the sound is distinct in a way, yet familiar too. Once you begin massaging the sound you may discover that this is one powerful tool. The sound fits into the mix and still has a command presence if manipulated right. Arturia will address the quiet click sounds made when switching patches, I find it annoying and distracting.                
The modulation matrix is super cool and acts a a great tool for sound design. I have some modules that are patchable and running them in conjunction with the matrix is no problem. Saving the patches with a sequence is very nice, running external audio thru the system is nice indeed. The mahogany sides look spectacular and the sheer weight of the unit says it will survive a while sitting in the studio. There is no way I will cart this to a show unless I can get a helper! The noise generators are awesome and really add to the overall sound designs. (if you like that kind of stuff)                
This synth is one of the few that made me feel challenged as a programmer and the tactile feedback of hardware seem to force me to rethink my habits to an extent. I wonder if someone new to programming would think it easy to use this? Of course, getting the sounds I want has always taken some effort on pretty much any synth.                
This looks very nice, beautiful in fact. I noticed a very small area that looked a little less imposing but 98% of this keyboard is classic in design. Touching it is a pleasure. The sliders are probably a weak point but only the years will answer that.                
For 2k I am very impressed, if shown this in the 80's I would have expected to pay about 3.5k or more.                
I have an Arturia beatstep pro and it is still working perfectly and the matrix is just as solid if not more so. Hopefully Arturia will be there for us if we need them.                
This synth seems like some kind of sleek futuristic machine just waiting to get going. People seeing it said it looked like the controls for a jet or something...Once I set it in the studio it seemed to belong there, very iconic. A  rack with modules towers over it and the wires draping back and forth are not in my way at all. The modulation matrix is definitely a wow factor in it's self.                
I have owned and used many synthesizers in my time and sometimes I discover that it may take more than a few moves to make the sound I am looking for. The Matrixbrute is probably not a good choice for someone who has never programmed on a hard ware synth, because it can be complicated. A recent review on Sound on Sound mentioned that it took the reviewer several days to really grasp the matrixbrute's ability and make sounds they felt were very good.
I wanted the Matrixbrute to help me organize my audio material and connect my modular gear to and to give me sounds that are not presets made by others. Truthfully, I am not satisfied with all the presets from the factory, they will be replaced in time. Even ones I do not like demo the abilities of the synth in the hands of some creative people. I would say that this keyboard has a learning curve similar to the ARP 2600 in some ways.                
This amazing little synthesizer is super easy to get started on and is so intuitive itl take you no time at all to start developing your own sounds. I use it mainly for bass and synth leads, but have had luck making some interesting hi-hats and kicks as-well. You will be very happy with your purchase even before you start to get creative with the mod matrix. The sequencer they managed to incorporate into the machine makes everything so much fun and so opens up a whole other world of opportunities. The possibilities are endless, and I am now a die-hard fan of analog sound design.                  
This amazing little analog synthesizer is easily played right out of the box.  Plug it in and you are instantly creating sound from thin air.  It has very powerful ASDR faders that are sweetly smooth and are very sensitive.  It is truly amazing that this synth has the features it does, producing high quality sound, clean, clear and crisp with that beautiful grainy analog sound.  I would highly recommend it to others.  
I'm not a keyboard player. I am a guitarist who loves 70s electronica like Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, Klaus Schulze, Ashra, and a whole ton of others. I got this in hopes that I would be able to make those kinds of sounds. Well, I got what I wanted and then some. This is an incredible little synthesizer, incredible. Thick analog sounds that you could bathe in. An onboard step sequencer that is easy to figure out and fun to play. Knobs and switches all over the place that deform and reform the sounds. Everything you need to be your own sonic mad scientist. I'm already recording with it. This is simply brilliant. If you think you want one, get it.                 
This is my first real synth with no presets. Had fun with this right away. This is a great little synth for experimentation with the different wave forms and filters. Sequencer is a really cool feature that allows you to jam on a repeating pattern. Also can plug a guitar in for distortion and modulation.                
I've got quite a bit of experience with synths, and upon reading reviews and seeing videos of the MicroBrute, I realized this was an incredible deal. I've only received mine as of yesterday, and I've already wasted a ton of time adjusting preset patches and making my own. The build quality of this synth is incredible, and all the parameters meld well together to create a huge variety of sounds. The only cons I can see are the lack of a sine generator and a noise generator.                
This is not the best or the most expensive piece of analog gear, but it will not disappoint! I bought this to synthesize my basslines because I was sick of fiddling around with VSTs and clicking of the mouse. I can't see myself ever going back to the digital nonsense when I have this monster ready to go. The perfect piece of gear to start your analog collection with. ** Spolier alert, this is for sure more of a beast than the Minibrute =) **                
This little guy lives up to all the hype it has been getting-super fun, super easy to learn how to use the knobs, super crazy unique sounds, super affordable-this thing is changing my bands sound and I like it                
Amazing little analogue machine that does so much. The price is better than fair, the performance astounding, there are many youtube videos to work with so that your understanding and range is increased phenominally.                 
I'm not a keyboard player, but this thing is amazing to create crazy sounds. It'll fit perfectly as awesome background pads and highlight sounds.                
Comes with everything you need to start hooking up modules. The only extra you'll need is mounting screws--it comes with 8 but, if you're like me, you'll need a lot more. Right now I have a Moog Mother 32, a Lifeforms SV-1, A Pittsburgh Modular ring mod and several Synthrotek modules installed. It goes together in a snap and looks great. It comes with a power supply, connectors and lots of room. I couldn't be happier!                
For the price it is great.  And version 2 software is a better user experience IMHO.  I really like the compactness of the controller but would have liked to have 8 more pads switching gets a little irritating at times. 
 I owned Spark and sold it mostly because of the software...got Maschine and I like most of it except for creating songs in it...got SparkLe and like it about as much as Machine.  
My advice would be save up and get Ableton and a controller because you have a lot more flexibility in creating things. Then if you want a little drum machine on the side.  Get this. It's fun and pretty inexpensive.                
I did do a lot of research on this hybrid drum controller from Arturia, as this is an older product. So, I knew going in that I should be fairly pleased with the hardware/software. But the SparkLE more than exceeding my expectations! The size, fit & finish of the hardware is quite simply Amazing. I’d seen reviews that mentioned that the machine is well built, but that is sort of an understatement. It is rock-solid; with every knob, button, pad and every other part of the drum controller feels top-notch! We have a Maschine MK3, the Arturia SparkLE feels just as good (maybe even a bit better!) than the overall feel of that Maschine. Really! We just needed something more portable (comes with a nice quality zippered sleeve, nice touch, Arturia!) and simple to use with good software to do some of our beats on. It’s also reportedly great for live shows, too. I love the hardware... the software is good as well. We encountered a few little bugs, which were resolved with a quit & reopen of the Spark 2 software application, but this hybrid thing is so much fun to use! Comes with a ton of including and bonus expansions that all sound great, but if you have MPC waves/loops or any other sounds, you can import them into your Spark 2 projects to have an even more expansive sounds content bank. Awesome! Buy it!                 
Bottom line: This is a fantastic and powerful hybrid drum machine and it's crazy underpriced at $200. Buy one.Support:This is an older Arturia product, but they've updated the software since it's release and are at version 2.4 at the time of this review. There are both free and paid sound expansion packs available. Sounds:The sounds that come with this drum machine are stellar; no less than you would expect from Arturia. Samples, synths, physical modeling, REX files, and importing your own samples are all supported.Production:You can get a ton of work done with Spark and the SparkLE before ever having to touch a DAW. Sequencing, sound design, sample manipulation, and mixing can all be accomplished in the unit's "standalone" mode. Run it as a VST and it auto-syncs to your project tempo. Drag and drop your patterns as MIDI or audio right into your DAW, or track out the channels from Spark's mixer. The workflow is simple and frictionless and creating is fast and easy. Live performance:Velocity sensitive pads with aftertouch, on-the-fly sequence editing and recording, touch FX controls, sound parameters, mute/solo, and looping can all be done live. The Tone feature lets you play any tonal sound chromatically, like a "keyboard" mode. Quantization can be turned on or off in real time.Hardware:The build quality is excellent. Solid feel, quality components. Feels like it will last. Overall:This is an amazingly flexible and powerful drum machine. Unless your allergic to using a laptop, this is a much better buy than a hardware drum machine anywhere near this price. The price is admission is well worth the sounds alone, and you're getting excellent groovebox software and hardware along with it. Options from Akai MPC and NI Maschine just can't compete at this price.I've barely scratched the surface of what it can do, and I'm already incredibly impressed. The only thing I would wish for is a tap tempo feature (maybe in a firmware update?) but it's a small concession and easy to work around.                
Hard to set up and no help over the phone available.                
Arturia SparkLE , , , don't buy , , REAL CRAPI bought this 3 weeks ago ,,,if I had read auturias reviews a week before my purchase I would not have bought it ..half the ratings are 4 stars , the other half are one stars ....im with the one star customers .....you will read from arturas customers that support does not exist ,,, it really does not ,,,you really wonder if they read at all ,,,they send you back random things for your fix-up ,,,hears what my purchase does , , , the very first install worked fine , I was upgraded to SPARK 2 ,, and I loved it ,,,,,,and 3 weeks ago was the last time I could use SPARK-2 ,,, as I shut down the spark-2,,,, 3 weeks ago it froze ....and has never come back on ,,,I have spent about 8 hours watching my screen uninstall ,,re-install ,,uninstall again ,, uninstall ,,re-install ,,uninstall ,,re-install ,,it has given me a big pain in my ASS .....I can only run the cd install , to play with spark-1 , ,and that only runs in the demo mode ,,,support has been worthless ,, ,,So what did I get for my money ,,, NO SPARK-2 ,, I got the original spark demo version....If I can return it I will......maybe in a few years this will be improved ..I was ready to buy the arturia 49 key keyboard with the bitwig studio ,,, but I think I will find a better company ........                
I bought this guitar out of curiosity, it sounded like a deal to good to be true but I was quite pleasantly surprised. It is a verry nice little guitar, it is a smaller guitar so dont expect big sound but so was my first guitr so here is a comparison. I bought my first guitar in 1960, my family wasn't exactly poor but there was very little money for non necessity's but I worked that summer so I took half my check(17.99) and bought a cheap stella, my fingers still hurt when i think of that guitar, It was a beast, big neck high strings no truss rod crummy open tuning machines, the finish was almost non existent and that is what you pretty much got in those days if you couldn't afford Gibson or Gretsch or something. I would say this little guitar is about 100 times better than my stella, it plays well, the Finnish is really nice, nice tuners, two way truss rod,an electronic tuner, a surprisingly decent gig bag, its just a plain good deal. there is no comparison between inexpensive guitars back the and the ones they make now days, Kids can get a really playable guitar for not much money                
This was probably the 3rd or 4th time ordering from zzounds. My beloved synth arrived in a timely fashion- (warehouse is not far from my house). Enjoyed the free shipping and especially the awesome payment plans. I don't know of anywhere else who would do a 12 month zero interest plan on a new synth on the market. The arp synth arrived in its factory box that was damaged pretty bad. But luckily this synth comes in a hard shell case. All is good. And they offered a return if there were any issues. Overall great experience and now I have my favorite synth in my arsenal. Thing sounds amazing. All about duo phonic! This thing sounds like a beast. Perfect for any genre of EDM. Put a delay on it and patch the output into the input with the supplied patch cables and you are in heaven. Very sturdy and well built instrument. This thing screams on filter 1 with the overdrive switch on. Don't hesitate to buy! Make sure to price match! This synth is not a beginners synth. Has a bit of a learning curve if you are not a synthesist. But read the manual and you'll be there in no time.                 
While really not knowing anything really about synthesizers except for the Fusion classics of the 70's and Techno jams from my youth. I did some extensive research on the subject and came along the Arp. 
This Synth is awesome(like knock pictures off the wall awesome). 
Beware though it does have a learning curve. There are no presets,everything must be done by the user. After looking through the manual at patches I've made really cool sounds. There is also online patches you can look up.
I have had it for a month and I'm just getting the sounds I was looking for.
In closing I would recommend this synth to anyone. It is affordable for it's power and the fun seems to be limitless. If you're wanting straight out of the box sounds I would not recommend but if you want uniqueness and power, pick it up.                
Just got mine today from zZounds I can't believe how amazing this thing is. I can't stop playing it. It's nothing like modern synths it really is hands on just you, your fingers and the sliders. I've become fond of this style when it comes to synth for some reason. There's just something about the ARP it has such a personality in it's sound. I could name at least 10 other synths that can do an ARP sound but hearing the real thing do the sounds is so incredible. Manipulating the waves are incredible and the manual is pretty funny but well done. I highly recommend to read the manual before just diving in like we all love to do haha they even put a page in the book for people that want to dive in and not read through the manual. I LOVE THIS THING!!!!                 
Sound quality relies heavily on the type of tube in it.  Highly recommend Tung Sol or EH tubes                
The one with the Meter on it is more useful, but this one is fine.  I use the MP to add a tad bit more gain in the front of my chain on one of my amps.
I took away one star on this model because this one doesn't have the meter on it.                  
just turn the dials up or down                
never had any issues with it.  I have 4 and they are all working great                
Less than $50?  Worth it                
if you have questions, they take care of you                
To be honest, I have been recording with these preamps as the pre amps for my condenser mics, and I really like them.  I am actually blown away at how good they sound with the replacement tubes.                  
If you doubt that the tube in this makes any difference, try swapping the cheap, noisy Chinese tube in this with a Tung Sol of an Electro-harmonix 12AX7, and you will hear a monstrous difference.  I use the versions with the meter on it, and I installed latched Tung Sol tubes in two of them, and what a huge difference.  Sweet tone, low noise, and low microphonics.  
These preamps are great with great tubes in them.  I own 4 of them, and I have tried several tubes in each, and they all made a huge difference in the performance of each of the pre amps.  So, I highly recommend these pre amps, because they are a great price, very sturdy and can take a beating, and they sound great with a good tube.  
So, my suggestion is to keep at least one of these under $50 pre amps on hand, and make sure that you change the tube.  I know from my own experience and my own use that if you change the tube in this to a higher quality, lower microphonic tube, you will have a great little pre amp.                  
It can be a little noisy if you are not careful, but if you set it up right, no noise at all. As far as adding "tube" warmth, no. The tube is just for looks. Sounds fine though. I have a Motu 896HD and this sounds fairly close, maybe just a little darker.                
For the price, you get what you pay for. No complaints here.                
Plug it in and go, make sure not to crank either the input or output gain all the way and your fine.                
I've had mine for about a year now, no problems.                
Definite value. I have used the Berhinger equivalent and the blows it away.                 
Haven't needed it.                
It's actually a cool looking little guy.                
I don't regret the purchase, and I plan on buying Art product in the future for sure. I might even get another one of these too.                
I have always used this preamp because of space and protability. I have used it on lots of vocals and it still sounds great! I don't know why some user's hate on the sound...maybe they are doing something wrong. Check yourself but this preamp rocks.                
enough for me.                
you could use it blind.                
very sturdy could probably use it to hold up my truck.                
are you kidding...budget studios this is your preamp...trust me!                
haven't needed it yet.                
looks good next to the pc and other gear.                
not in the near future unless they drop the avalon or one of those preamps off the ssl g series consoles to under 100.00.                
I'm not an audio purest!
Though I listen to audio all the time.
Sounds great to me.
A simple preamp with the adjustments needed.
Includes the 48 volt phantom power for the new mics.
Wall wart power supply is included.                
Simply adjust the gain and there you are.                
Great price for this little gem.
Worth over it's price many times over.                
Worked for about year and a half so far without any problems.                
Need a preamp, this here's sexy!                
Worked for almost 2 years so far.
Surly can't complain, and when it
does go out, should just need a tube.                
It always sounded great until 2 months into use, I started hearing clicking, like there was a grounding problem although there was none.  I'd wait, and it would go away.  Then no sound came through at all after 4 months.                
There were no features, and that was exactly as I wanted.  It's simple and without unecessary frills.                
I hope that the other ones they make are of better quality than mine.  It seems fairly well built, but without any maltreatment whatsoever, it died after 4 months.  No bumps or light tapping or even transportation.  It never moved or had anything done to it other than semi-frequent usage.                
It's a great value if it continues to work.  I thought it sounded nice, with maybe too much emphasis on the low-end (probably meant to make it seem "warm," like people are calling it).  I think that it is well worth the money, but the risk of having it die has convinced me to try another cheap brand of preamp.                
Never called support because it was too cheap to worry about.                
The "I want it" factor really just comes down to "I want a replacement."  It's abscence is very saddening because it has deprived me of a functional microphone input for my system.  I depended on it, and now I have to use my guitar pedal as my input again, which is a tragedy.  I'm on a pathetically small budget, and it's functionality was integral to everything I do.                
Overall, a seven, because I liked it while it worked, and I assume that not all die so soon.  You won't experience any problems with its sound quality at all, unless the problems I had are product-wide, which I hope they are not.                
It sounded fine for the time being.                
Just the basics. +20 gain. Gain knob, output knob, phase switch and 48v power switch.
Does not have on off switch.                
Its a mic preamp, easy.                
IT DIED WITH IN 5 HOURS!
I recieved it, connected it up and tested my mic (shure sm7b) with it and had the right loudness. Then I tried to use it and my level was so low, but the preamp hiss hadn't changed. All settings where exactly as I left them. Even maxing out the preamp with +20 gain on did not yield enough. I see it as a tube problem. Very unhappy, I deserve it for spending such little and expecting it to work so well.                
If it just kept working I would be fine with it. Except it didnt.                
ARTs website doesn't even work right. Why bother even sending it back, I spent nothing on it. It will make a neat paper weight or door stop.                
Its black, its a box and its metal.                
Not happy with its usefull life. 5 hours and it craps out, even cheap Behringer gear gives you more time.                
Good sound, nothing wrong with it.                
It's small, I rap so I dunno how it works for those rock and roll people, but It just sits in my studio and I turn it on when I need to rap, and it works perfect.                
It's a great pre-amp.                
They miss spelled words in the User's Guide (lol even microphone, its still a good product)                
This is a great pre-amp. I was reading some of the reviews and I got a little worried about how good it would work. But it works great, I have no problems. It's small, but it's great for rappers, I dunno bout Rock and ish like that.                
This was the only thing I could complain about, great with a bass but a little airy and loud with anything else.                
Very basic and perfect for simple projects and use.                 
Nothing easier to use                
Seems very sturdy actually dropped it once and still worked as well as it did before. I'll give a little more use before I decide                
Best Preamp for the price.                
Havn't dealt with any yet.                
Decent little metal box, not ugly, I like how it looks with my stuff.                
I'm looking for another one not the best for what I personally need but still a good product.                
for the price i was expecting less but after the first try i was amazed how much it was getting my sound warm and clean. 
by the way ive read in an article by joe gore(tom waits guitar player) that this preamp was sounding 1/40th less good than his 
2000$ avalon preamp  -future music magazine august 2005                
all that i need 
but a vu meter would have been sweet                
well theres 5 buttons.. nothing complicated                
looks and feel very  fragile and it gets hot quickly                
the best you can have for that amount of money                
didnt need it yet                
some say it looks dull but i like its 70's gear style                
i give 9 for now but well see how far i go with it...looks very easy to break                
Does it's job, It's all metal not cheap plastic, works great                
The advertised specs on this model are exaggerated, expecially the S/N ratio. Simply put this is a very noisy unit. Put it on the front end of any size PA and "hiss" is loud.                
A set of level LED's would be nice.                
It's an EQ, not much to it.                
The product appears built well.                
I replaced this unit with a dbx and there's no comparison.                
Again a very noisy unit.                
Impeccable sound. Better than others in the same or higher prices.                
Good basic features.                
Very Easy                
Well-built like a tank. Durable on the road/studio.                
Big bang for the bucks.                
Ok.Good.                
I got it.                
For this price range, this equalizer is adaptable to all uses and functions. Input jack versatility is the key point here. High volume input and low noise output. A cream of crop for equalizers.                
Purchased the mic splitter to seperate the stage monitors from the front of the house so that we could have control of the stage sound. Works fantastic, now we can set our own monitor mix independent from FOH. No more trying to get the sound guys attention to change something on the fly, thanks to the mic splitter we have our own mixer on the stage with us in parallel with the FOH mixer. Best stage sound we have ever had ! A great investment.                
Does wht it says, it splits a balanced xlr signal two ways. In my case one line to my monitor mixer and the other to my presonous firestudio.                
Sound levels vary. Sometimes it passes full level, sometimes it attenuates, you just have to click the switch a couple of times to hear the difference.                
It sorely needs a separate led that stays dedicated to the a/b mode while you are in the y mode.                
The switches are too close together, and when you are in a hurry you can easily stomp both switches leaving you in a bad place. I rebuilt mine in a new box I got at radio shack, I chopped the board apart and split the switches farther apart. Much better.                
This brings up the other reason I had to rebuild it. The in-out jacks do not create a positive lock on your cables. More than once during a performance a cable would just fall loose. I replaced them with cheap jacks from radio shack which make a tight click when you insert the cable and they hold securely.                
Well it was cheap, but there isn't much to it. Having rebuilt this one I now know that I will be building my own from scratch very soon, so I can eliminate the level inconsistency problem. It doesn't bother me too bad because I am using an ART TPS2 tube preamp following the switch and that gives me quite a bit of tube compression. Great pre-amp!                
Honestly, I give them the benefit of the doubt, but I have not tried to contact them about my problems, what are they going to do? Short of a complete redesign there is nothing they could do.                
The unit hums and pops so loudly, could not use on stage. Cuts signal and power. Tried different gauge cables 18, 16, 12, 10, made no difference. Tried to use it to split speaker cabs, only one side would work.Lost the packaging as was on the road. Gusee what? cannot return                
The outputs and inputs were backwards. I had to reletter them after I finally realized the factory got it wrong. I know it's unbelivable, my  other band members didn't believe me either until I showed them. Also I finally  gave up due to unprecidented feedback coming from the my setup once I introduced this box. Whatever it was the 2nd unit I've  worked with. The first one didn't work, this  one did but input /outputs backwards. I'd stay away from it!!!!!                
I just bought it and will be looking for a differant one that will switch SILNTLY. I took the chance wilth the little to no info I could find on this and lost. What's with the big clunky bang when I switch the pedal? Guess you get what you pay for.                
The A/B-Y part is very nice. I can play in one or two amps at the same time . The LED light is working ... nice to know where you stand with this thing visually.                
It seems solid. I've only had it two days .                
I'd pay more for a silent switch that used good old American HARD steel screws (that won't strip after using them twice).                
If they'll eat my return postage I'll send it back to get a silent switch.                
Over the past year, I have bought pretty much one of every make of cheap tube preamp out there, including this one. How does it rate? The best of the bunch. Of course it is the most expensive... But you do get two channels. I like this unit, but would urge readers to change the tubes. The Chinese tubes in it are not that great and really do not let the unit sing. I use Mullards and and am very happy, especially at high plate voltage. The unit has a fairly shallow noise floor and so is not totally pro gear, but for the price, it is better than anything I have found.                 
Nice features, including the dual plate voltage. Have not fully tested out the digital features yet, though.                
Easy to use and a good manual.                
It is a well made medium quality unit. I think the weak link in all Art products seems to be the power supply and I would encourage users to run it through a power conditioner/filter system.                 
Solid value --this digital unit and the less expensive analogue sibling. If you have the cash, buy it.                
no experience                
Looks fine. I mean, it's a rack mount unit --what do you want?                
If I lost mine, I would replace it. Though, maybe not the digital version, depending on what converter I had at the time. But the preamp is best value for the money out there, if you are into the tube sound --which I am.                
This was a much better quality unit than I thought it would be. Very nice quality construction, and great usability. Sound is awesome - everything just works well, digital spdif outputs was a nice addition and I'm glad I got it with this option..                
I am currently working with the ART mic pre amp and it is an awsome piece of equipment.  It gave my condenser mics more room to breathe and it offers much more.  I am using it in my homme studio and will surely look into other ART products.  It fit my situation.                
No accessories bring used.                
The ART is user friendly.  Not complicated all you need is patience and apply your settings.  Adjusting your mixer and other equipment is vital, but the end result will is very positive.                
The ART mic pre amp seems to be very well made.  In my case it is rackmounted in my home studio, so it will surely stay in good condition. It looks good and the meters and led lights make it bright and easy to see from a distance.                
Absolutely.  Good deal.                
Have not dealt with the company.                
It's an eye opener.  It looks like it definetly belongs in a recording studio.                  
I have been using it for a couple of weeks, and I have gotten very positive results.                  
I was looking for a pre that would work and not take a chunk out of my paycheck, all the one at he sites I usually go to cost 80.00 on up to the "Holy jezzuz" level, I didn't need all of that for a Staton table with USB for the digitization of my albums, I seen the ad for this, and for the price I wasn't expecting allot, when I plugged it in I was very surprised, This thing not only worked but it worked real good, crisp, clear and I could dial it in with the addition of the the Gain-trim knob, the LEDs help you out two so you can maximize without going to far. for the money you cant get anything near this value. If you don't believe me, it will be your loss.. get this, you will not be disappointed.                
I have an old Pioneer PL12D deck. I recently had to replace my old Sony Amp. My new Sony amp has all the latest stuff but no phono input! So I purchased art DeeJayPrell Phono Preamp. Man, I'm happy! This more than does the job and the price was awesome. I'm playing Carly Simon "Anticipation" right now!                
This thing sounds better than it has a right to for the money. I've bought and returned several "budget audiophile" phono stages I didn't like as much as the ART. Nice, even tonal balance and reasonably open sound... Decent bass weight for a budget phono stage.                
Two capacitance choices and a switchable rumble filter can come in handy and are very nice bonuses at this price. The signal / clipping indicator is over the top for the price too. The gain control can be a little "tweaky". I would set it while shooting for the most balanced frequency responce, rather than just how loud you want it.                
Just plug it in and it works.                
The quality seems very nice for the price. It's mostly surface mount micro parts, but premium capacitors are used in the signal path for the RIAA EQ. Power regulation and filtering look better than average. The ART comes with a 1000 mA wall wart which is much beefier than what comes with most of the competition. No upgrade necessary for good sound. The signal to noise ratio is excellent.                
The ART is an unbeatable value. It outperforms some products selling for three times the price and more.                
n/a                
It's a nice looking little aluminum box. Nice little light show... The power LED can burn your eyes out...                 
Overall, it's just crazy good for the price. I'm sure there's some higher-end stuff out there that would sound a little better, but I've tried a few more expensive phono stages that weren't as good. I'm very happy with it and I'm done looking to upgrade. On top of that, the variable capacitance and rumble filter are really nice features you don't always get, even for significantly more money. This one's a no-brainer, unless you have a high-end system and are willing to spend much more.                
Sounds great: The S/N ratio is probably better than that of my turntable, or my cheapo receiver, so how can I complain?                
If this item had a power button or automatic off, I would have rated it higher: as it is, I had to rig one up from the wall so I could turn it on and off. Also it has selectable 100 and 200Pf capacitance, but no "normal" setting.                
Strictly plug and play.                
Hard to tell long-term reliability, since I have only had it a week, but it seems solidly-built.                
Yes, definitely worth it. The next best ones cost MUCH more ($150.00). There are cheaper ones but they can't match it in specs. I'd recommend it to anyone who bought a receiver without a Phono input.                
N/A                
Decent esthetics.                 
It does exactly what I expected it to do, and it was relatively inexpensive.                
We provided lighting and sound for another DJ a few weeks ago. We had a bad hum when we connected their laptop to our system. We worked on the grounding and minimized it but it sill bothered me. We have used our system with many laptops in the past but had never had this problem before. I purchased ART DTI Hum Eliminator. The two channel is great for most applications and I recommend every DJ and sound tech have one or two in their gig bag. I also purchased the 8 channel rack version for our outputs to eliminate potential ground loops with my powered speakers and subs. Great isolation transformer at a very good price for the quality.                
How much can one say about an isolating transformer?  It works, without introducing noise, and it was very reasonably priced.  It cured the ground loop on my Korean Washburn HB-35,                
It can handle 3 types of hardware on input and on output, and they can be mixed and matched.                
Duh. Just plug and unplug the jacks. Either turn down the vol when you do, or use an impulse suppressor.                 
It's pretty sturdy, although I wouldn't want to test that with a long drop onto concrete or marble.                
AT the sale price, great! At the usual price, I'd give it a seven out of ten.                
Not Applicable                
It's just a transformer, for heaven's sake!  It won't get you laid.                
The only thing I'd change would be to improve its physical stability. It's tiny footprint means that it overbalances easily, and falls off amps, tables, etc.; I usually just tape it in place.                
The design is for only removing ground loop type hum, mostly 60 cycle in character.  It does that very well. In my case, it did fully correct a problem associated with using an old style tube preamp in a modern cabled up world !  Hum virtually all disappeared.
A product that does all it says it is trying to do. Novices need to understand that this unit was never for any other kind of noise.                
multiple plug and play                
Insert in line and you are done.                  
Parts are everything with this kind of product. And the parts are good.                
Once a maker like ART has this being manufactured?  It can be done cheaply for them.  Price was kept relatively high for their profit.                
NA                
This is a miracle, should you really be battling groundloop.                
Should work longer than anything in the studio.                
I bought this box as a cheap stereo ground-lifting solution, and it does the job pretty well. It might seem common sense, but using the 1/4inch balanced inputs and non-balanced outputs sometime produces odd results.                
Bought this after my Behringer HA400 headphone amp bit the dust. I was a little apprehensive to spend more money but after receiving the ART HeadAmp I have no regrets. The quality difference between the two is obvious. Having both size plugs on the back is also a huge advantage, I'm never looking for those adapters that always seem to disappear.I can't say a bad thing about this unit. Sounds great, feels great, 3 year warranty... next time I will buy the ART unit the first time around!                
These are great ! I had a cheaper 25 dollar headphone amp that would distort at times. These have NO distortion and the sound quality is Phenomenal. Take it from me..pay a little more and buy this product. zZounds is great ! They always have excellent customer service ! This is the place to buy from !!! Thanks guys...                
Great service....I enjoy dealing with zz                
You could always go with the tube route but at some point there are only diminishing returns. I was pleasantly surprised with this item HOWEVER I would suggest that they add a power switch on the next model. My one complaint!                
Have to admit I was a bit suprised how solid this piece of equipment is built. It's small but packs a punch! Clear sound at all levels. I even turned everything up VERY loud and it performed extremely well!!                
Haven't had to use costumer support.                
It is what it  is. A small, 4 channel headphone amp....                
Sounds great and has plenty of volume.                 
Simple volume controls and that's it. Ialso like the option for 1/4" and 1/8" TRS outputs and inputs.                
Easy. Easy. Easy.                
It is built like a tank. The only issue I have is cosmetic: (Note to manufacturer: Large, bright numbers 1,2,3,4, identifying outputs on front would be helpful. The output volume knob numbers there cannot be read from more than a foot away.)                
Great price.                
I would replace it.                
Wife is hard of hearing. Regular headphones with volume control were not strong enough. By using the ART Headphone Amp, she can now hear the tv again using regular headphones. Works great.
Only suggestion, would be to install an on/off switch.                
Very sturdy unit                
I use the ART HeadAMP6 Pro 6-Channel Headphone Amplifier it sounds great easy to use. I rock out and record with my friends with out disturbing the family. I run a Tascam DP-32 mixer head phone out to the ART HeadAMP6 Pro 6-Channel Headphone Amplifier w/ a Roland TD-25KV electric drum set an Avid Eleven Rack and get the same sound I'd would as if I hooked headphones directly in to the mixer, TD-25KV, or the Eleven rack, sound doesn't change that's a plus in my book                
It's not Hi-Fi, it by no means sucks but I won't brag on the sound. It's full, raw and in your ears. What you put in is what you get out and recording on the go doesn't always yield the best results but whatever I can capture through mics, placement, and interface with the mercy of the room, this amp will faithfully reproduce it and I can't ask for more.                
Everything you need, nothing you don't. My favorite type of gear! Master Stereo in, and an individual AUX for each channel/player with an output on the front and back. Perfect. Stereo, Mono L/R, Dual Mono. Awesome. 2 stages of gain with bass/treble knobs, Master/AUX blending knob with level meters all around. Righteous. Lots of lights to make it look official when I'm workin, sold and sold! No but really the mono selections on the individual channels light up red(L) and blue(R) and I'd be lying if I said I don't like lighting the whole thing up when I'm working.                
I want to say it's point and shoot but with modern interfaces and digital internal routing (I use the Scarlett 18i20+Octopre) It's not quite as simple as plug and play, even with analog mixing, plan your routing to use this unit as intended. I use the 8 outputs of the 18i20 and have a snapshot of the direct out routing in the software. Once you have the routing for your needs it's as simple as hit the power, turn the master up and let individual adjust their channels to taste. Each knob is labeled plainly and levels let you know you're in business.                
Metal construction, knobs are solid with little if any play. I haven't noticed any. All the plugs are 5/10. Not loose, not tight, just right. With gain staging there's no need to crank this thing, so I haven't encountered distortion even for practice in a very small space with a full band. Acoustic drums and all. I'd say this thing is right on the money.                 
You can always get a Behringer, but where's the street cred? You don't need anything fancy, right? It's a headphone amp. But it would be nice to have personal monitoring without a routing nightmare of extensions and clip on amps with no control. That's not asking a lot! You shouldn't have to spend a lot. 90% of us will love this headphone amp. For a stage box, practice room, home studio, it fits the bill and it's all I'll ever use until I go digital. 10/10 would buy again.                
I hope I never need it. I'm very pleased with ART products and they haven't let me down yet.                 
Wow, ART makes great stuff at a great price! Already have a shopping list of their stuff for future upgrades because of their featureset philosophy and great prices. This thing made me a believer of in-ear monitoring as well as my bandmates. Plus it looks great in the rack!                
I bought this to fill out a mobile recording rack and have enough outputs for a typical band and having tested it out on the go it's the first of many ART products I'll be buying. For those of you looking for a mixer pre-wireless personal monitors, look no farther!                
Clean and plenty of volume ,, Bass and Treble controls a plus ,, lotta bang for the buck!!                
Decent sound and utility for the price.  Definitely worth the money.  Thinking about buying another.   Zzounds was fast...no problems.  
RPSGT88                
Decent features.  Enjoy the LED meters.  
RPSGT88                
Very convenient and easy to use if your source has XLR outputs.  
RPSGT88                
Pretty well made. No complaints.  
RPSGT88                
Decent value for the money.  
RPSGT88                
Have not needed assistance.                
Looks great. Rate it a solid 8 of 10.                  
The price was good, number of outputs more than other units, looked good, inputs XLR, it fit what I needed.  
i bought this to protect my Porter and Davies drum monitor as well as my Yamaha DTX 12 pad.  Works great. I just wish the  light was the brighter.  If I ever replace it I will get the upgrade that has the pull out tube lights.                 
I needed to get rid of stage clutter caused by having four direct boxes for the acoustic guitars used in my duo. The ART PDB4 does just that by having the inputs on the front and the the XLR outputs in the back, we just plug into the ART and leave the connections inside the rack pluged in. The only drawback that I have found, is the unit was picking up noise from the power supply for my mixer. I just moved things around in the rack and the noise went away. 
You probably wouldn't get any noise from the Radial rack mounted direct box, but it's $800 and the ART is $80. 
Overall, this piece works well and is a very good value.                 
I have the rode k2 tube mic going into this bad boy. And for the price your crazy not to get it. I love it and I haven't even changed the Chinese tubes out but I got a couple jjs on stand by. I researched a lot before I got this and I'm happy with my decision. Just wish it was 2 channel.                
This product is the best in its class. I have tried pretty much all the cheaper tube-based preamps and this product is by far the best. That said, the stock Chinese tubes are not very good and I would highly recommend upgrading them, preferably with vintage "New Old Stock" tubes. (12AT7 tubes work well, as well as many others in the general family that includes 12AX7's that are the stock item. Don't be afraid to experiment! I found a number of nice choices.)                
I have a slightly older Art MPA II digital unit and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the new MPA II has better front-end gain. Same model names, but I guess Art has been quietly improving them.                
Best in class. When comparing prices with cheaper low-voltage units, remember that many of them are mono, and that this unit has two channels. It is worth the few extra dollars --for sure. As I said above, replace the tubes --easy to do and makes a big difference, given a good vintage tube.                
Basic design. Not "sexy" but functional. What more do you need?                
If lost, I would replace it. Many other tube preamps I would not replace...                
I use this mostly for stereo micing on acoustic guitar and drum overheads. I use a Universal Audio 710 for vocal recordings. I have usaed the ART for vocals but it doesn't quite do the job I want it to. But on acoustic guitar with 2 mics, it's amazing! There are lots of options for shaping a great sound. In stereo mode, the right channel output knob becomes a pan pot which I think is pretty cool. The mod-side matrix is also a great feature. I changed my tubes in this for a pair of EH 12AX7's and that really really helped too. I recommend anyone buying this to do the same.                
Lots of features for a preamp this cheap. I had to play around with them for a little while to really grasp it. But a lot can be achieved with this product.                
Great quality. Solid build.                
For under $300 this thing is a steal!                
This has a really sleek look on my rack. Looks very pro.                
This unit gets a ton of use in my studio. I have used and own high-end equipment and I still use this preamp a lot. If it breaks, I will buy another one. But I must say that this has given me not one single problem at all. Really great product and value.                
The sound overall is what you'd expect from an entry level mic pre.  Right channel is quieter than the left. I don't know why, but the left has a slight hum.  It is not that noticeable if you pay attention to your S/N ratios when recording. Sound is nice and warm and you can really focus on your mic's sound by using the low cut and impedance controls. Need to use the +20 gain a lot with dynamic mics, but with condensers you can get a quiet yet punchy signal without it.                
no accessories                
What you see is what you get in terms of the interface.  The manual needs to be rewritten for the current version of the unit.  It refers to switches by the meters that do not exist on the current unit.                
it is in a project studio now, no idea of its roadworthiness.  Seems to be reasonably solid construction.                
excellent value for money.  If you are using mixer preamps for your vocals you will notice an instant improvement in intelligibility and clarity.  If, however, you are using a high end mic pre, you will be able to tolerate the MPA sound, but you will likely not be impressed.                
haven't needed any support.                
ART makes decent looking gear.                
If it were lost or stolen, I'd probably take another step up the ladder of mic preamps and purchase something better.  That said, it is a good utility pre that is nice to have around for vocals, voiceovers, or acoustic recordings.                
Fantastic sounding unit. I bought it for the M/S mode, to use it with my Avantone CK40 stereo condenser mic, and in both normal and high plate voltage modes, it sounds incredible -- vibey and warm in normal, crystal clear and clean as a whistle in HPV -- but everything I use it on takes on this warm presence, bringing the sounds a little closer to me in a way where it feels like I can reach out and physically touch them. The DI is just as amazing; I may never use my Eden Navigator for bass again!                
I run a internet radio station, this preamp took live events to a amazing level. Mics never sounded better, no noise and very clear broadcasting in front of the stage. Going to Add one more to my rack very soon!In the studio this preamp also shines
Have not needed to contact support                
Overall this impressive mic pre-amp is very good. I had to exchange it for the ART Pro stereo EQ Compressor, because I made an error in choice of equipment, and it was not the correct device for what I am trying to do in my studio. MY FAULT!!! Otherwise this tube pre-amp is excellent to use with studio condenser mics that need 48VDC phantom power as well. You cannot get the warmth and resonance of tubes in a solid state device! That is where this unit is unique indeed. WZRF-LPFM                
This preamp, although priced well below the competition, does quite well in providing quality audio, substantial gain and variable controls (Impedance and low cut filter) features that create a value-packed item.  Only used it about a month in my home studio, but am very pleased with the results.                
Easy to learn layout, makes a world of difference for my little studio. Well worth the money.                
I am a proud owner and I love this amp and I ill spread the word as well as continue to order fromzZounds, again and again.                
Very easy.                
Excellent. Don't be afraid of the DA-AD conversion. This compressor is worth going out of the box. As long as your using high quality converters (Im using the EMU 1212 PCI-e) and your levels are set correctly you will be just fine. 
My signal chain is as follows: DA -> ART PRO MPA II -> ART PRO VLAII ->mixer ->AD ->DAW.
You will have to play around with the attack, release, ratio and threshold to find the best results. That simply comes with experimentation and trial and error.
Has all the features one needs to dial in good sounding compression. If I were to nip pick, It would be nice to have a side-chain input and high pass filter, but with this style of compression and at this price point its not really all that necessary. I have yet to use this on individual tracks in a mix but would like to experiment with that soon.                
Pretty easy. For mastering  I have found that attack times in the range of 30 - 50 ms and  release times from 150 - 500 ms will get you in the ballpark.  I tend to set my ratio very high to help me "hear" my attack and release, then when you find the music is pumping the way you want, back it off to a more suitable setting....generally 4:1 or lower.                
Its a tank. its a heavy metal box. Knobs and buttons feel high quality. Hopefully it will last and be reliable for years to come.                
For the price point of this compressor you cannot afford to not have one. This will give your mixes that vibe and sheen you've been looking for and add a nice analog quality that's difficult to achieve only using plugins.                
Never used them cant say.                
I've been mastering in the box and get pretty good results, so no, you don't absolutely need this compressor. But it does add that extra oomph to your mixes that I have not been able to find exclusively with plugins. So if you want that extra sparkle its definitely worth having.                
I purchased this compressor to be used in mastering. This is my first hardware compressor that I have ever worked with. Over the years I have built up a carefully select few of good, high quality mastering plugins. I have gotten great results and my clients have been happy.
However I felt it was time to jump into the analog world and add some hardware flavor into my mastering chain. I could not have been more satisfied with my choice. Used correctly, this box will take your mix and zip it up in a nice warm blanket of analog goodness. It gives your mixes that final sheen. Solid, punchy lows, clear mid's and smooth highs that's not just high frequency dulling.
When mastering I encode my mixes to M/S. This allows me to process the mid and side separately. Once The audio is routed back into my DAW, I then decode the side information and mix it back in with the mid. This method has yielded the best sonic results. You also have the option for stereo and dual channel compression.                
Thanks zzounds for play as you pay. I can afford to do other things, and also make payments, never had a problem. That they didn't fix immediately and I was satisfied. I will continue as a long time customer thanks again.                
I got a chance to use the fender supersonic 60 a few years back and I was blown away by the sound of that American made tube sweetness I just had to have it thanks to zZounds they made it happen it's made me a better guitar player right off the bat by being able to actually feel the dynamics of your playing through the amp just blows my mind now I don't wanna put my guitar down!                
I bought this preamp to be a secondary stereo channel. I work mostly with Summit audio gear (with sounds great). But, the ART preamp ended up being the best sounding preamp I've ever worked with. It has a very big and open sound when used with good world class mics. It's super smooth. Very surprising.                 
It has everything.                
You need to find your sound. But, with good ears you can get a great setup.                
This was used to split one microphone to feed two broadcast consoles.  It worked much better than the "home-brew" resistive splitter previously used.  However, the transformer in the unit isn't shielded and it WILL pick up hum from nearby power transformers, so place the unit carefully.
Overall, I'm happy with the unit and would purchase it again for the same use without hesitation.                
I liked the first one so much that I dedicated to my Korg MicroArranger that I purchased a second dedicated to the 2 mikes I use for my guitar amps.I've had non-tube compressors for a long time but irregardless of what some reviewers have mentioned (on different blogs), the tube really make a difference..depending on your speakers/headphones, if there good quality you'll hear the difference alright, obviously the rest of the circuit makes a difference . The VLA has a simple but functional front panel. The bypass is a little suspect, seems to be a little harsh, but if I wanted to bypass I would eliminate the VLA and go "DI" into my DP-32. I'n not wealthy but I came into a little extra money and have replaced my non-tubes with tubes. Like most compressors that do there job, you see see there is a lot less clipping... with the VLA's there is less clipping and a plus a more concise and warmer sound. I especially noticeable are the drums from the Korg. .The drums from the Korg are really good going DI but with the VLA II , sounds like the drums are in my home studio.. they don't become homogenized and maintain good delineation from all the different drum sounds . and as most reveiewers have said, for the money, they can't be beat (so far).                
Wouldn't change anything (except my playing)                
TUBE PRE                
No learning curve just dial in what you need.                
Its big and very "cool" looking.. built like the preverbial tank.                
A big YES                
no                
Haviing a tube pre has made a huge difference in my recordings, I can easily tell the difference between my none tube and the VLA II's. Thats right I bought 2. One is dedicated to my condenser mikes recording my guitar. ( have a great stereo mike) and the other to my Korg Microarranger. When recording a drum track which the Korg has excellent choices, the sound reminds me of the drum part in Pink Floyd's "Learning to Fly) I'm sure each one of there compressors go for $thousands but even so, the sound is similiar with this big bang for the buck item. IBesides my own recordings, I make sound tracks for video. aaaai play lots of slide.. use to think I only wqanted acoustic but with the VLA with no effects, the sound is like butter and I can beef it up by bypassing one of the channels and balancing them to my needs. It lends itself very well when doing the mixdown . Imaging .. soundstage etc. Nothing wrong with none tube compressors I have but introducing a tube in the mix sweetens things up. One complaint I have.. it has no Phantom. Got a Rolls 2 channel for about 50$. I also own a PreSonus Studio Channel ..I'm going to do a review on it soon.                
the Art Pro VLA II does what it says. I didn't change the tubes because I wanted to keep the sound coming through the VLA as transparent as possible. Coming out of the UA Solo 110 (which is an awesome mic pre) going into the VLA II the vocals come out very smooth and sit in the pocket perfectly. I liked the Solo 110 because it adds a nice sheen to the vocals but needed a tube compressor to tame it a little and the VLA II does a nice job of doing just that. solid build quality as well.                 
I record solo artists and full bands from home, I use an Isa one Preamp for vocals, got the art pro VLA to add to the chain, upgraded the tubes with a pair of jj electronic 12at7 tubes, and I must say, the vocal quality and shine added to my recordings is exactly what I was missing, if you record from home and you just feel like your recordings don't sound as good as the pros, get an Isa one Preamp, and this compressor, studio quality vocals with the depth and shine I've been missing for years. I also upgraded my xlr cables to mogami neutrik and that seems to be the magic recipe for amazing, quality, studio vocals from home. Can't say enough about this product, worth way more than they charge. I got this and the Isa  one on a payment plan and was approved with horrible credit, zzounds is an awesome resource for people with little money but a steady job. Thanks again and UPGRADE THE TUBES!                
The art pro vla2 does what it does GREATLY!!! Simple to hook up and use. Id give it a couple hours to really heat up but once it does WOW!!! Though it does not have a really fast attack time the way it handles is smooth! If you want to get a great compressor at a steal of a deal this one is for you!                
Does exactly what its advertized to do and then some.                
Nice quality build  not cheap feeling like some other units costing 2 or 3 times te money                
plug and play  read the set up guide  hooked it up. no muss no fuss                
Steel case  and good quality feel to all the nobs  well thought out                
If after buying all the basics  all you can afford is one piece  then this is it would be worth the money at 3 times the price                
 wouldn't know never needed them                
Definatly adds a profesional look to my rack                
if it were stolen I'd buy another one  as soon as possible  and will be buying 3 more  to add  to my set up                
Ibhated this thing at first because I was using it for tracking and couldn't get it to sound right. Bought a new interface to run some drums through it and now i see where it really shines. Kicks, snare you name all come to life with great tube warmth. Again I really wouldn't put it on a vocal chain but for mixing its a keeper                
Sketchy at first, didn't like it much for tracking on my voice. Sounded pretty good on everyone else. Mixing with is great, especially on drum samples and 808s                
LED Voltage can be previewed using a rocker switch before power up to guarantee a safe trip for your expensive equipment. I love this feature. Quality built unit with nice spacing for your outlets. Like the pullout lights for the front and a light stalk for the rear when you are in a dark environment. Using this unit for a home/portable unit to run sound for my home and for friends. Planning on buying at least one more for lighting equipment rack. Can't beat zZounds interest free payments!                
The LED VOLTAGE readout can be previewed BEFORE switching the unit on, a nice safety check with your expensive electronics at stake.Solidly built unit and the included light stalk on the rear is a godsend in dark conditions letting you clearly see the sockets.This is my second one for a new studio rack                
Nice to be able to preview incoming voltage before powering on devices. Solidly built with well spaced outlets.  No rating for sound as it does not make any.
I now have 3 of these units in use in my home studio                
I bought 4 of these units which provide me 32 channels of transformer-isolated "splits" for my mobile multi-track recording rig. The improvement in my recordings is incredible- the sound quality of these inexpensive splitters is quite good, but the greatest benefit is NOT having to use the direct outs of the FOH console (which are POST-fader, and pass ALL of the FOH GUYS MIX AND INSERTS).
I'm very pleased with this product!                
I was originally considering the "2-way" version of this ART product. But for a few bucks more, I chose to buy these splitters which have TWO transformer-isolated splits per channel. As my equipment grows, I plan to use the second set of splits tot feed a redundant recording rig. And in the meantime I have already used them to feed the monitor system for a couple of larger shows.                
Gave this category a "9" for one little reason, and that is simply due to the fact that the inputs and direct-outs are both located on the front of the unit. Not a HUGE problem, but it does make for a "cluttered workspace" when I patch my split rack into the stage box, and the FOH guy has to patch his mic cables into my rack.
The "fix" I'm putting together- a 32 channel stage box on a short snake, so the FOH guy has a "clean" panel tot work with...                
Bought 4 units (totaling 32 channels) and four 8-channel xlr snakes, installed them in my rack, and have not had any problems whatsoever. Clean, clear splits feed my recording rig, and I'm a happy camper!                
I am very happy, and would certainly buy these again if I was starting over. Perhaps one day, when I'm running high-end "boutique" pre-amps on every channel, I might find a flaw in these... but I can't hear anything"cheap" about them now!                
Haven't needed it...                
My only comment that is even remotely close to being anything less than "a perfect 10" is pertaining to the layout- having the front panel cluttered with the direct-outs- but I knew this going in and chose to deal with it. After all, if that were a "must have", I'd have bought their "2-way splitter" as I was originally planning.
I went with these for the ADDED BENEFIT of having TWO transformer-isolated splits per channel, PACKED INTO A SINGLE RACK SPACE! If "clutter" around your input jacks is a concern, buy the 2-way with both of the outputs on the rear, or do what I'm doing and add a breakout panel in a stage box.                
Already owning and loving the ART P16 xlr patchbay, Digital MPA, and Headamp 6, it came time to share the signal so I turned to S8. It wasn't a difficult choice. The isolated and direct outs pass singles very cleanly with no noticable change in quality, possibly a db or 2 of volume reduction. Overall well built and dependable!
I feel I need to share this context for the application tho for others sake. I picked up 2 to use in place of my patchbay and provide extra throughput. They worked as expected for live shows but when I went to record a band direct to my rig the drum overheads weren't giving me signal and after 30 minutes of trying things I realized it's because on the 3way the direct out and input are on the same side.
I was using the 16 isolated outs on the inside as my patchbay but the isolated outs WILL NOT PASS 48V. I bought the 3 way because getting the 2 way with both outputs on one side would mean either I put a strain on the snake cables making them do a U turn inside the back of the rack or I put my patchbay on top of these 2 units and buy 16 short xlr cables to patch isolated outputs out of the rig and use the direct outputs for my rig inputs making the 2 way more expensive and complex to implement than the 3 way. You cant always have your cake and eat it too I suppose. Hopefully this helps someone else decide on which unit will fulfill their needs! I have returned the 3way units to exchange 2way because I am a firm believe in ART products and will continue to buy them as my business grows!                
I use this amp in my main guitar rig in a combination pedalboard.rackmount system based around the Tech21 PSA 1.1 preamp. A lot of processing goes into this amp, zero noise, clean, reproduces what it sees. I run XLR line level into it after the signal is stepped up through a PreaSonus tube instrument preamp. I have zero bad issues with this amp, great value for the money. Studio quality, can hear the fan only when shutting down the rig mains. Problems others have may not be the amp but connection, cables, impedance, ground loop issues. I love it myself, would not hesitate to but ART power amps. Great product!!                
I installed this amp in a studio. Here's the email I got from a user the next day.
"Noticed the new amp in the studio... by the noise it generates!
Heard this high-pitch, whining, humming noise, traced it to the new amp. Almost sounds like a fluorescent ballast going bad.  Why does a new amp make noise? Would it be unreasonable to ask for the old amp be reinstalled, because it was quiet? Or maybe move the new amp to somewhere we can't hear it?
Please let me know your thoughts, as the noise is just annoying."
As an amp, it's OK, I like the security panel, balanced inputs. But the fan noise just makes it unacceptable. Sorry.
I am currently using this to amplify a Line 6 Helix into two 8ohm 4x12 cabinets. Easy setup & operation. It works well in my live rig. I would buy it again without hesitation. I own several ART products, some of which have been going strong for over 15+ years; so I don't have to guess about the quality.
Minor gripe: I wish it had quarter inch outs in addition to the binding posts.                
My previous monitor amp died a week ago. I picked up this ART SLA-1 as a replacement and I love it! Mine was delivered just yesterday, so I set it up last night and listened to a few recent mixes using the SLA-1. I hooked up my Tannoy monitors to it and I can hear some details in a recent remix I did that I could not hear previously. I would highly recommend this as a studio monitor amp. It is compact, powerful, and very clean. The output is really detailed and clear.                
I use two to pull audio for recording and the sound is dead on.                
No frills.                
Easy and fast!                
We pack in and out twoo times every weekend and these can handle the road.                
Great price                
Looks good and stacks well.                
I have three of these and they are super. Easy to hook and easy to configure. I use one as a combiner and two as splitters. Great product for the price!                
This is the second one of these I have purchased, primarily because I have been so happy with the first one. I don't own any $1000+ preamps so I can't compare this to those high-end units but for the money, this is an awfully good buy. The preamp is quiet within reasonable limits. Maybe with a mic that requires extraordinary drive levels, this would be a bit noisy but for all of the mics I have used with these it's drop dead quiet. The tube drive provides just the right amount of warmth for my needs. The built-in compressor is quite effective. It lacks the ability to really fine-tune attack, comp, etc, but it's very musical and I don't find that I need much else.                
Quiet preamp unless you want a little tube grit. Compressor is very musical. One might want a bit more fine tuning control but at what cost?                
This one unit can be a mic pre, instrument DI, even a guitar overdrive. Pretty useful.                
Tweak a couple of knobs and let this baby sing.                
I have several ART products. They're built very well and pass the hard knock test.                
Excellent bang for the buck.                
I haven't had to deal with ART for service or repair on any of my items, some of which are nearing ten years old.                
I'm not much on wow. I prefer good quality at a reasonable price.                
This is the second Tube MP/C I have purchased. It's such a great value, I had to have another one. I have a small home studio which operates on a tight budget, so inexpensive, good quality gear is a must. I have been a fan of ART products for many years and I have never been disappointed.
This particular unit is a real gem. I use several ribbon mics which are notorious for needing lots of gain. These have plenty of gain for any mic and the pre is very quiet. Dialing in just enough tube warmth is simple and the built-in compressor is sweeeet.                
Has some very good sound.  I am using it on drums
and on vocals.  I hope to use it soon on a mic
acoustic guitar.
I like the adjuster selector.  There is some hiss
when you push the gain button but that is to be expected
on a low budget pre-amp.                
I like the option of the selector button.                
Very easy to use.                
Good strong case and looks like it will last.                
Very good starter pre-amp.  Very well
built.                
No problems with the amp.
I di peg the needle and I thought I busted it.  The
needle returned to normal.  I had the mic recording with a amp
producing the output.  This created a loop that made
the pre-amp pegging the needle.                
Just a good starter pre-amp.                
For what I am doing I expect to use this for several more years.                
Over the past year, I have bought pretty much one of every make of cheap tube preamp out there, including this one. How does it rate? Not bad, and improves somewhat if you change the tube. Still, for this price I think I would prefer the other Art unit, the mic preamp. But this unit does let you play with all those different settings which can keep you occupied, and off the streets.                
Would be nice to have a ground lift and a high pass (low cut) filter. The cheaper Behringer copy of this unit has a low filter, which is nice. (Though its sound is not as good.) The similarly priced Art mic preamp has a filter too.                
Easy, though all those instrument options are ultimately a bit of a waste of time, I'd say.                
Hey, it is a cheap unit. It should not be considered road worthy or anything like that.                
Good value, but basic circuitry. Don't expect miracles. Sounds somewhat better if you swap out the tube. I put in a Sovtek (taken out of my Studio Projects preamp) and that worked well.                
no experience                
ok.                
I am glad I bought it, just to see what you get for the money, and I will use it (with a different tube --Sovtek), but not as much as some other preamps.                
Very full tube sound!                
I only miss the earth lift.                
The knobs are long and therefore handy but also a threat to damage in my pre-amp flightcase.                
Good price for a good sound!                
I never needed any contact with the company.                
It looks cool with the VU-meter!                
I only miss the earth lift, otherwise it is a cool complementary di/pre-amp to have. It is cool for phantompower, DI, eq settings, pad. I use it for a lot of different instruments and voices.                
i just got it & it sounds great. i run my AM/DLX Strat thru it into my G/DEC 30. What a differance! It adds more dimention to the sound spectrum.                
The voice knob is pretty cool. All the controls are easy to understand & operate.                
I found it easy to figure out & adjust to tweek the sound I want.                
The V3 seems well made & pleasant to look at.                
I could not find another product like this for this price.Great value!                
N/A                
I like the color & the design of the unit.I added larger rubber feet so it would set ontop of my G/DEC securely.                
THE V3 is very versitile. It's a mic preamp, DI box, it definitely
does what I got it for, to enrich the sound of my Strat thru my amp!
I also have a GnX4 workstation I plan on running W/theV3 & expect the same results.                
You can get great sound from this preamp. It's all in how you set it up.. Use a quality mic.. I use the Sure beta 87.. Use quality cords.. I use "monster cable" mic cables.. Then finaly plug it in with a 1/4" plug. Don't run the mic cord out into the mic input on your board.. Thats why some people complain about noise.. It's running through two mic preamps.. I get great sound and the noise is so low that I can't hear it even through headphones hooked to the board.. You can't go wrong with this preamp..                
The variable valve voicing works very well, just dial in the sound your looking for.. The only thing I can think of that might be usefull would be a low cut switch, but it does work very well without it..                
It is constructed of steel and look like it will hold up for quite some time.                
Great deal for $120.                
Just played it for over three hours with no problems - just the smell of a nice hot tube and a warm sound.                
Lots of presets to choose from depending on the feel you want. It's pretty good for how low price it is.                
Just plug and tweak and play.                 
Just got it so it's hard to tell, but the box arrived from Fed Ex pretty thrashed- but the tube and casing are in great shape.                
Seems to be nice and solid for the price.                
No experience.                
It;s only a one tube pre, but for my little lo fi studio and D.I.Y.sound it's perfect.                
If it holds up I'll just keep it, not upgrade. I checked other reviews and compared especially to a Behringer I decided to go with the ART and I'm happy. I like the compactness, the ease of use, the solid metal body, ooh.                
The Art Tube MP series has been around for quite some time and as a budget tube entry under $100 bucks I'm not sure if it has ever been dethroned. I purchased this to match up with my Rode NTK microphone. I didn't want to spend a bunch on my budget setup so this being a budget tube Amp was a brainless decision to make. The good bad and ugly about the AMP is that in truth it doesn't utilize the tube as a true tube amp would but it gives a decent tube effect of warmth. What it is good for is being a budget preamp with slew of settings that are in fact all different sounding depending on what option you select.I feel like that is the true strength of this little box as most preamps in the price range are just that only "pre-amps" with no options. The MP studio V3 gives you lots of those.Sound wise you get a decent selection and decent output of your sounds. I did not notice any undesired noise coming from it. My let down of the unit however came from the VU meter dying on the second day I owned it so build quality I do have to question.If you want a tube-ish sounding pre-amp with lots of alternating output selections than this is an ideal choice. If you have more than $100 to spend I'd say to look at something better.                
I just plugged this unit into my Mackie Onyx Satellite FireWire Audio Interface (Line in) and WOW... Mackie has some great internal pre-amps... however this ART Tube MP Studio V3 really makes it all shine. I was blown away by the warmth of this unit on vocals where I believe it really shines. Exactly what I wanted... and more...                
I love the presets that this unit comes with... Just plugged in my acoustic and my electric and turn the dial... anyone can get great tones out of this unit. Love it!!!                
Just so simple... even a kid could use it.                
Full metal jacket... strong and looks durable!!!                
Zzounds... You did it again... I paid $69.00 for this unit and I believe it was worth far more... Like $300.00!!! This unit made my mics sing!!!
P.S. I wish you (Zzsounds)would carry the (Tung Sol 12AX7) pre amp tubes... I would love to buy them from you!!! I should not have to order them from Canada...                
Have not had to call anyone... I did see some chatter while I was doing my research about the "tube" inside... being noisy...cheap. So, because  I like a nice blues "warmth" tone... I took this unit fresh out of the box and replaced the Chinese tube with one from Russia... Viola... Just AWESOME! Just what I wanted!!! I only regret not having gotten this unit years ago... P.S. If ART would have just put in a decent tube (Tung Sol 12AX7), they would have made far more money on these units. Their loss, our gain! :-)                
Really nice on my desktop... Love the VU meter and the lights... good and solid... all the way!!! A MUST HAVE!!!                
This is a KEEPER!!! I may buy another one from Zzounds....                 
The Sound is very clean depending on the mic or input device, you may have to ground lift the the device to get rid of the noise. If your input and output are set wrong the device will tend sqaush your signal giving a distorted sound. I would reccomend turning your input to three 3/4 ~25db, and then slow increase the output.                
The setting are kinda of wrong different voicings work better on different instruments                
durable                
I think the price is a little high for what it does                
I use the product to for my mics... works great                
IT   IS VERY  GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD  FOR  THE  BUCK   BABY   DON'T  BE  TO  FUSSY  ..   WORK  ALONG  WITH IT ...... AND  YOU  WILL  GET   GOOD  RESULT   FOOL  AROUND   A LITTLE   TRY   TRY  TRY  ...  I   KEEP     ...ANYWAY                   
YES   AGAIN   EASY   EASY  AS  1-2-3                
VERY  STURDY                
VERY  ......  BUY   KID  ROCK                  
DON'T KNOW  HAVE  NO PROBLEM  WITH IT                  
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS                
YESSS   IT  WORTH IT                 
Great for its price range and portability. I use it to take the edge off the piezo pickup in my acoustic, and to fatten up my electric. Guitar signal comes into the V3 then into a Boss GT-3 using 1/4" patch cords. I've never tried the V3 with a mic.                
It has plenty of features; too many. The variable voicing isn't as useful as I thought it would be -- most of the "voice" settings aren't useful IMHO because they're overdone. For example, the acoustic guitar setting boosts the highs too much, making it sound harsh and brittle. I just use the limiter setting.                
Seems solid enough. Nice all-metal chassis. I like ART's chassis design *much* better than some of the competing products, which have the tube sticking up through the top of the pre-amp (!). One time the meter light started to flicker, but it didn't affect the sound; eventually the problem went away on its own.                 
I wouldn't pay extra for the variable voicing feature, but I do think the V3 sounds better than its Tube MP siblings. Maybe this is a newer design, or maybe it's just my imagination, but I liked the V3 better.                
I e-mailed ART about the meter light thing, and got a polite and helpful response -- four days later.                
Sex appeal? Um, no. In fact, I'd be deeply concerned about anyone who gets that sort of stimulation from changing their gain structure...                
I like this unit a lot. I tried several other pres (SansAmp Acoustic DI, PreSonus Blue Tube, & others) and I thought the V3 had the most pleasant and musical sound for my application. I'd definitely replace mine if it were lost or stolen.                
The sound quality has been perfect for my needs. I record track at a time into a soundcard, mixerless, so this preamp/DI box does it all for me. The people who said the V3 voicings sound too exaggerated or harsh, well that may be true on its own but record the tracks and put them into the mix, and youll find youll barely have to reach for EQ to let the track sit in the mix. Since getting this unit Ive never had to really EQ guitar tracks, vocal tracks (using the Studio Projects C1), and bass tracks. And thats why the sound gets a 10. I havent had any hiss problems at all, but Im guessing the hiss comes from people using it in conjuction with a mixer, which is a double amplification of the signal. The tube is a part of the signal chain because it wont produce output with the tube removed, Groove Tubes 12AX7 produce a better tone, so consider replacing the stock tube. DOesnt give any tube overdrive, just subtle warmth and at full input some bluesy type overdrive. So just make sure you have its output going to the recorder and not a mixer, and use the V3 voicings, theyre there to make your recordings sit in the mix easier. For 100 bucks this sounds great.                
For a compact budget preamp, it has the V3 settings which save so much time when it comes to mixing the recorded tracks. It has a built in compressor/limiter based on what settings you use. It has Phase reverse, phantom power, +20dB pad, VU Meter, 1/4" and XLR inputs/outputs, comes with wallwart ac adapter.                
Because of its basic control knobs (input/tube, output/master) and auto-set limiter, its simple to use. Good thing since beginners are probably the target market for this preamp. Not to say that as a bad thing as its a great value.                
Made in China. but real sturdy, the knobs dont feel cheap, the paint/decals are sharp and crisp, the LEDs and VU meter work well and are easy to see/read.                
For the ease of use, good sound, and features of this little box, its definitely a little more than what youd exepect to get for 100 bucks.                
EMailed the company asking about changing the tube and they got back to me within a day.                
purple and black color scheme....works in a funky way i guess....still a nice thing to look at on your desktop.                
I give this a 9 because its probably one of the best budget preamps, works as a DI box, has a compressor and the V3 voicings make mixing a hell lot easier. If your making your first recording preamp/DI purchase for your home studio, i strongly recommend this one over the other Tube MP models.                
Fattens things up for the most part, but can get hissy sometimes.  Not sure why.                
What else could you want?  VU Meter, Phantom Power, voicing, etc... anything else you need for this price?                
Have used it a bunch of times.  Have experienced clean fat sound, and have experienced hiss... but the clean sound outweighs the hiss.  Price is great too.                
I Love how this little box sounds. If you have a small diaphram condenser, good amp and good effects this little box accurately gives you the sound of everything you use. Lower the output compression and you can get rid of hiss from your amp to get the sound nice and clean. XLR's and/or silent knights will also give you excellent signal clarity and reduce buzzing. I have also used it direct with my Zoom 707 II and it makes the clean effects sounds great but the box will get hot direct so I recommend going amped. I gave it an 8 because I assume that Focusrite would be the best quality but ART is an excellent box to start with for a home studio.I don't recommend using a mixer with it because it sounds excellent by itself on guitar and I have also used it on my drum machine through a PA and they sound like real drums.                 
There are not too many features but the best one is phantom power and the instrument presets. Wish it had a 3 band equalizer though.                
Nothing wrong with the quality.The box has solid construction with metal. The Tube would be the most sensitive part of it though. It may break if dropped.                
I believe it was priced right. Most preamps go for 4 times this box.Excellent way to start getting creative.                
Never had to contact the company. The box has been working great so far.                
If you have a home studio you definitely want it.                
I give it an 8 overall because I know there are better preamps but this is definitely the best box to get on a budget. The quality is excellent. Go buy it.                
The Voice Channel has improved my Vocal recordings tremendously. I use a Bluebird mic running through the voice channel and was blown away by the improvement of the quality of recording the ability to add warmth via the tube setting. Since my homestudio enviorment has not been treated for recording and the gate function on the Voice Channel has worked phenomenal in keeping backgoud sounds out. I'm pretty new home recording but love this Voice Channel.
The only thing is I wasn't able to record a acoustic guitar very well through it but that's most likely to my lack of knowledge of recording instruments for vocals it's awesome.                
So much you can do with this thing. Love it.                
I took it out of the box and started recording. Knobs are well labeled and pretty easy to figure out. Still learning though.                
Well for the price you can't beat it. I've been researching a mic pre-amp w/ gate and compressor etc. This all-in-one machine is a whole lot of                 
Well for the price you can't beat it. I've been researching a mic pre-amp w/ gate and compressor etc. This all-in-one machine is a whole lot of function for the price. I'm vey pleased at what I got forthe price.                
haven't had any problems yet.                
I have a small (compared to some) home studio, so I was unsure how to best use my small amount of space when it came to upgrading my sound quality. After playing with the voice channel for a couple sessions, I was blown away by the killer character it added!  From then on at my studio, it has simply been referred to as "THE MAGIC BOX" because everything that goes in to it, comes out sounding better, every time.                 
Where do I begin...i've owned this now for a month and it's brought my recording quality up a lot.  First of all the preamp is excellent.  Swapping out the tube MIGHT be something i consider one day, but anyone who says you have to in order to get excellent sound is likely not using this properly.  It goes from very clean to quite driven.  And I love that I can run the EQ before or after the compressor depending on my needs. I tend to run it before the compressor and there are a lot of online tutorials that explain why.  
Compression is easy and effective and let me tell you... i have NEVER used such a good De-esser before. Not in hardward or in software. The De-Esser took me maybe 3 minutes to find my frequency range and it does such a good job. 
But here is the reason my (and any other vocalists ive tried) have had such a good performance... i can set up the right tones/ compression/ gain during the warm up take... then by the time it's done, the vocalist can relax. It takes care of sibilance and volume peaks and they can just give their best performance. This unit is FANTASTIC. 
Do i still do further editing in pro tools? Of course. I think that's a big part of where the shine comes from. Find me a pro mixer who doesnt. What this does however is get the raw take in a form that allows the vocalist to give them best performance possible and saves me TONS AND TONS of time.  It's paid for itself in man hours by my second project.                 
Art mic pre's as a guideline are known to have a "dark" sound. But with features like semi parametric EQ, adjustable impedance and selectable plate voltage you can achieve more airy sounds with judicious use of an aural exciter it can be quite an airy sound. I use it with several good mics -A sony c38b, SE z5600a mkii, Rode NT1A, Samson VR88 and a cheap Apex 420 large diaphragm condenser. Curiously enough it is not the kind of pre that will make an 800 dollar mic (z5600amkii) sound like a million dollars. But it wont make my $2000 Sony sound like crap either. Its a good mic preamp with its own very usable sounds. But if you're thinking you can match it up against a really great mic pre and come out even then it will fall a little shy, still for just over 400 dollars? Grab it. Its one of the best in the price range only the Joe Meek OneQ is in its league Then again I havent used the Eureka or the GT Brick.                  
The most useful feature is semi parametric EQ, followed by the selectable plate voltage and adjustable impedance selection. Not super crazy about the compressor. Metering is amazingly good on a unit at this price so are the output options. I dont think anyone has a system that this won't integrate into perfectly. I mean it, that's one of its strongest features.                
Like anything the deeper the feature list -the trickier it gets. Still its all right there labeled in creme avec noir. no menus and sub menus though (I'm sure one day even tube pre's will be plagued by this.)                
Its a tube pre i'm not gonna through it up against a brick wall to find out. Tubes are sensitive. thats the way life goes. looks pretty though espescially when that VU meter is lit up and the compresser is working away. Use it on the road? no I would not. worst aspect of quality is probably that they dont use a premier tube then again one premier tube can set you back fifty dollars.                
I own a few mic pres and a few bundled mic pres
its better than the pres on my behringer eurorack because it has higher headroom.
Better than the pres on my Emu 1616m for the same reason.
I prefer it over my focusrite twintrak about 60 percent of the time.
equal to "my" (okay its a loaner...) joe meek oneq                 
not applicable. Thank God.                
Its beautiful actually.                
Well i think anyone who takes the studio aspect of music as being more creative than utilitarian has to go out and search for more sounds and more ways to capture sounds I'm not getting rid of this thing even when i can afford a Focusrite 220                
I have been a singer/songwriter for 46 years and have had various studios and home studies throughout my musical career. The Art brand is a brand I've been familiar with for many years. This channel comp has the absolute most bang for the buck. You've got to have a good ear though to get the settings right. I love it. It is a permanent fixture in my vocal rack.                   
Excellent sound for the money. I swapped out the stock tube with a Telefunken.  I use this primarily for voice overs with a Rode NTK. The impedance adjustment, EQ, compressor and gate give me everything I need to tune in what I need perfectly as I sometimes need to turn projects around very quickly with little time for fine tune editing. De-esser is also a plus. While this will never match a tube pre amp costing thousands of dollars, the 300w tube voltage gives some actual warmth as opposed to the "starved plate"  pre I was using prior to the Voice Channel. A keeper!                
preface.. I also have 2 PRO VLA's and a PreSonus Studio Channel. When I 1st received the "VOICE" I actually thought it was working proprly because the difference when making adjustment did seem like much of a change. 1st thing I did wrong was not letting it break in.2nd thing was that I expected it to sound like my others.Now its a while since I received it and I guess it broke in but also I wasn't noticing what a smooth signal thta is patched to my DP-32. I actually noticed it when I played back a recording I did. LIGHNIN' HOPKINS VERSION "BABY PLEASE DON'T GO" It was buttery smooth but still had some punch to it... All my other compressors were straight analog. These are my 1st tubed. I really like the "voice" when practing I went "D I" right from the VOICE. always used an amp before. The sound really inspires me to keep playing because of the nuances and the great "pads" I play blues and slide.. finger picking. Its always been a challenge to keep the dynamics in line.. with the pad I don't have to mute the bass thumping any longer .. yet it doesn't sound attenuated... this alone is huge.. in fact, I ran the Voice thru my PA and with a few adjustments got some over drive from the tube and the PA sounded like tube amp , maybe not exactly but close enough so I will gig (solo" using just the Voice Channel and P A. with no amp. There are many more positive things I could say but I don't want to gush and its been reviewed nicely by others. The VOICE CHANNEL isn't like a sludge hammer its more like a brush and pallet with many colors.                
I purchased this to hear how the drums (from Korg MicroArranger) sounded.I connected left to the Voice Channel and right to my Pro VLA just to have stereo. The Voice channel sounded really bad. I started turning knobs and pushing buts and realized immediately that one little increment made a huge difference. Time went by and it slowly started to sound amazing.. with the VLA PRO II on one side and the Voice Channel on the other.. something happened I hadn't expected... ..imaging... Using the VLAP RO for the drums was great but the VOICE Channel took It to another level I didn't exspect. I was thinking about purchasing another Voice Channel (I'm not wealthy at all) but the pairing is so great I think I'll go with this set up.. I should add that the PRO VLA' is really good and as is said many time "especially for the money" In my opinion it brings whatever out front and is pretty transparent. I highly recommend the Voice Channel (I can only speak for drums) as is said many times, if the drums sound right everything else falls into place. THe WOW factor should be 5 stars+                
Just needed a simple, affordable fix. And while it's tempting to spend $100 what are you really getting with that much extra money? I'm really not sure because this thing works great! I use it exclusively as a Bass DI and while you can overdrive it if you're not paying attention to the bassist and let him run his bass through a pedal board then to the DI, it's been flawless at gigs providing clean bass reinforcement in the mains. Quite the bargain.                
Clean and perfect sound!                
More features than I expected!                
Easy plug and play!                
Metal casing, and very high quality throughout!                
Very low-priced for the features and quality you get!                
ART customer service is easy to contact, and they supplied me with excellent information prior to purchasing.                
The black and purple color scheme looks cool, and the shape of the box is cool.                
When the venue I run audio at needed a direct box, the ART ZDirect Passive was my first choice! ART products are always top-notch in quality, making ART a brand I can rely on. With phase invert, low-pass filter at 30Hz, two 20dB pad switches, ground lift switch, and 1/4" tap to run to an amp; this little gem has all the tools you could possibly need from a direct box! Plug your instrument into the 1/4" in, plug the XLR output to the mixer, and you're all set! This box doesn't even require batteries, phantom power, or a wall wart! This is an excellent product!                
Great charger! Use it for wireless mics and IEMs. Built in capacity tester and USB slot for cell phone. Must have for frequent user of Rechargeables.                
I've recorded in different home studio settings from padded rooms to closests with blankets and also using other types of reflection filters. I purchased one of these a few months ago and it's the best of the reflection filters. It absorbs your voice and keeps it all in the mic. When I listen to my vocals solo I can't easily hear the difference even in an open room. At first I was going to take the cheap route but I'm glad I didn't it's totally worth it. My mixer even told me to redo a couple tracks that I did before I got the filter because the vocals sounded so much different. I found when I position the mic about halfway into the filter and I stand back a few inches from the mic while recording I get the best results.                
If you record in a home studio without a vocal booth this product will make the difference between a good sounding vocal and a great sounding vocal. I've had refection filters before but not one of them was able to do for a vocal track what this is able to do. Would, without doubt, recommend the Aston Halo Microphone Reflection Filter to anyone who records in a home studio without a vocal booth.                
Upgraded to the Halo from the SE Reflection Filter PRO and loved it instantly, its definitely lighter and easy to transport, It definitely eliminates the need for a booth. Would recommend this product to all looking for a great reflection filter.                
Neumann u87                 
Easy                
Built like a tank                
Worth waaaaay more then the price point.                
Great support                
Blew my mind first time I plugged it in.                
This microphone made me get rid of my Tlm 107.. Never thought I'd see that day but I did! Great for vocals.                
Flexible and forgiving. Provides a forward, firm tone with a silky, yet proportionally detailed sound. Vintage/modern/british/mid-glue.
I bought the Aston Spirit because I was working on an album with a reggae band and my normal go to vocal mic took a crap on me. I needed a new vocal mic and fast. First I ordered the slate VMS mic because I had heard many good things about it but the problem was it was on back order for weeks and I didn't have time to wait, so I went on zZounds and found the Aston spirit. Now I'm not one to buy before I try but since the mic was only 399 and zZounds has a great return policy I decided what the heck, I mean every review I had read up to that point only had good things to say about the mic. The Aston arrived 2 days later and I had our first vocal session that night so I threw it up and plugged it into my Warm Audio TB12 and WOW! The Aston has a sound of its own but its a very beautiful sound. I have used it on low male vocals, high male vocals and acoustic guitar so far. For Vocals it has a nice bright sound but not overly sibilant.  I had to do almost no post processing on my vocals because they sounded good straight though the Warm audio TB12 and a distressor. I did add a de esser but very subtle. I haven't compared this mic with any others yet but I can tell you with certainty that the Aston is a great sounding mic and if some one didn't tell you before that it was only 400 dollars you would think you're holding a 3000$ mic. The mic feels like a quality mic, its got weight to it, not a light plastic feel, and the brushed steel finish with the custom steel mesh around the capsule makes it easy on the eyes. Once I get my u87 fixed I am going to do a shoot out between the aston, slate vms, u87. and shure sm7b and see how they compare!                 
This is an excellent microphone, and I don't just mean in the usual "this is excellent for the money" sort of way. It's very natural sounding, but with something of a lift in the top end. I've found that, because of this, some of my usual go-to mic'ing methods don't work as well (it's pretty easy for this mic to make certain sources sound harsh if you aren't careful), but anything that forces you to do things differently is a win in my book. I'm loving getting to experiment again, and I have the Aston Sprit to thank for that!
One small caveat for me is the lack of a tiltable microphone mount. Aston have been very clever with the way they integrated the stand mount into the baseplate of the microphone, and that works for some scenarios, but I'm not really excited about having to buy their $120 shockmount just so I can tilt the mic (the Sprit has a built-in shockmount, so an external one isn't totally necessary). I believe OnStage makes a mic-tilt attachment that's something in the neighborhood of $10. I'll be buying that for sure.
Skill-wise, I'm somewhere between an amateur and an intermediate level engineer, so my opinions should be taken with a grain of salt. I haven't had the opportunity to compare this mic to many others in its class, so I really can't speak to where it falls on the spectrum of sub-$500 microphones. What I will say, though, is that I did my research before I pulled the trigger, and I felt confident that this was what I wanted. So far, I'm not disappointed.
It's truly a platform to build on.  The arm is excellent, so you may choose any cartridge you desire.  If you can't afford a separate preamp, the internal gives you the option of MM or MC cartridges.  The optional output to a separate preamp allows you to match the cartridge to the preamp.  There are many lower priced turntables, but this one is the best of the group.  Let's not overlook the ground wire that allows you to ground the motor for no hum at any volume.  Add a white acrylic mat from Hudson HiFi, and now you can get the most from your records.  I chose to add a weight from the same seller, and it holds the record against the acrylic to deaden the background noise, tighten the bass, and give greater detail to your highs.  If you have never owned a turntable, then this is the best you can buy under the price of the AT-LP5 (manual from Audio Technica).  The English magazine rated both turntables 5.0 in every category, and few ever receive these marks.                
Clarity. This is my first "upgrade" and I was skeptical because I didn't know if I was upgrading or just getting a more expensive turntable. This thing sounds very good! The music is very clear at any level. Turn it up though, it's powerful. I want to put out some good words about it so that someone like me doesn't hesitate on getting this thing. It's also easy to use, I was always afraid of counter weight, anti-skate. Now I have no problem.                 
Saves space, keeps mic in one spot! Love it! Just make sure you measure your cab first... I have a Fender Bassman reissue, and had to make sure I bought the smaller version. The bigger one says XL, but the regular version has no additional size notation.                
Thge Grabber add's that litte extra that makes the difference between just hanging your Mic (with some brand's, as we know ) to a placement that is stable and secure, with the ability to be moved for differnt sound's from placment of your Mic to cab !! it also is Great because of it's easy mounting and dis Mounting for use with other cab's . In all I find it to be a Plus in both Live and recording situations.                
first, There are 2 sizes to the cab grabber, the standard and the cab grabber XL. be sure you know which size you need!!! 
for this i blame zzounds for not clearly indicating this fact in the ad now, it makes you devide which model you want prior to purchasing where that option was not there ay my time of purchase. (i still love you guys, but this lack of knowledge destroyed the tolex on my amp which is where i had to attach the cabgrabber as it did not fit on my cab.) 
the cab grabber is an excellent idea in theory, but in practice i have been left with just an ok flavor in my mouth. 
it is difficult to get set to the proper position because the locking mechanism is brutal to secure while attached to a cabinet, so you have to take it off to lock it, then replace it, then repeat if it is slightly off. this is based on many tries.
the cab grabber's biggest flaw ist that the arm that holds the mic is too short, but can have a boom arm attached which only contributes to the pain the previous flaw mentions. how hard would it be to make this arm telescopic so you can truly get the desired placement without the hassle of another attachment?
again, great in theory, and really is secure when properly applied. just takes too long and too much aggravation to get to the point of properly applied.                
I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE NOT KNOWING THERE IS AN XL VERSION AVAILABLE, OR THAT I WOULD NEED THE XL VERSION. HOPEFULLY I AM SAVING YOU FROM THE MISTAKE I MADE. I HAVE AN ORANGE 212 CLOSED BACK CAB  AND IT IS DEEPER THAN THE GRABBER WILL EXTEND. IN TRYING TO RIG IT SO THAT IT WORKED, I RIPPED THE HELL OUT OF THE TOLEX ON MY BRAND NEW CAB. NO ONE TOLD ME  THERE IS A BIGGER VERSION, SO I AM DOING YOU THIS FAVOR. MEASURE THE CAB AND DECIDE IF THE CABGRABBER OR THE CABGRABBER XL IS THE PROPER UNIT FOR YOU. aside from  that, its a well built cool device.                
Big, fat and punchy toms of all sizes.  Amazing on guitar and bass cabs.  Good on any kind of percussions and it can even do a kick drum without any problem.  I only got 2 of them in the venue I work and I never know where to put them: it sounds good on everything!                
The mike is quite straight.  No switches or anything but a rugged construction made for the most demanding tours and venues.                 
Plug it in, aim and turn up the gain.  Done.                
The only thing that is not that good is the drum mount that comes with the mike. It's kind of cheap, unstable and easily broken.                
Totally worth it!  Studio, live, name it!                
Never used...                
The body is not that sexy, but you can have a crush for a voice... no?                
The mikes I have in the venue I work for were there before me, and I think they will still be there when I'm gone!                
The D4 works well for a kick mic for our band .....I had read other reviews where others say it work well on a floor tom or bass cab ....I have not tried it in that manner yet .....I'm sure it will...as far as the kick ....it works great .....we get a good solid low end sound ...and we still get the sought after tick that you listen for in a good kick drum .                
N/A                
N/A                 
very well made ....solid !!                
There were other kick mics to choose from in this price range .....I'm happy with the D4                
N/A                
its a good looking mic ......it is a little smaller than other kick mics out there .....but it works well for Our Band                
Should keep me happy for years to come .                
I have not done side by side comparisons of bass drum mics, but purchased the D6 based on a recommendation and lots of internet research.  I have been able to get very different and very good sounds by altering placement of the mic.  Inside my 18x20 maple bass drum the mic picks up good attack and plenty of low end punch.                
It comes with a quality mic clip, thread adapter and a padded pouch which is all you could really ask for.                
The mic is machined out of a solid piece of aluminum.  There is nothing to rattle and I'm sure it is quite durable, though I don't plan on testing this theory.                
It's ten bucks more than a beta52 and same price as a D112, sounds great and seems like a winner.                
I have had no need to contact customer support thus far.                
Although I don't have experience with other dedicated bass drum mics, I know what good audio sounds like.  This is a quality product made in the USA and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.                
I bought this product (Audix D6) after reading recommendations at several sites.  I find it to be better than advertised!  I put it on a stand in front of my bass drum head, and with no special adjustments got a great sound at a live outdoor performance.  I had been using a CAD KBM412. The CAD KBM412 is not capable of providing a faihful reproduction of the sound presented to it.  I like my CAD 411s and 417s, but that KBM412 was a nightmare compared to the Audix D6.  It is so worth the extra $s!                
The retailer included a drum mic stand with the purchase.                
plug and play                
Looks like it is well made.                
N/A no problems, registered purchase online in a few minutes.                
Its a mic...it doesn't have sex appeal!                
If lost or stolen, I would be in mourning until I got another.                
I had owned previously a shure beta 52 microphone for my bass kick.  I had borrowed this microphone for a larger worship gathering and it just kicked butt.  Now my drum system sounds more fuller, because this mic produces very deep, rich, bass sounds.                
Just as a warning:  only use it with bass kick or at worst case, with bass amp.  Very good tailored made mic for bass sounds                
Very tiny but powerful                
If i have another drum system, then yes, another d-6 i will buy                
I sing acapella (bass) and I was looking for something that could enhance my bass vocals. So I started to experiment and ran across this lil dude. All I can say is WOW! Even though this is a bass drum mic, I used it in a couple of gigs as well as in the studio and folks, this thing rocks. Not only does it provide a low end sound (as it should) but it's also clear as a bell, I'm very satisfied with this product and will buy another now.                
got this for my pdp concept maple kit to mic for live performances and it works great no issues                
This mic is good on more than just bass drum.  I've found many uses for the Audix D6.  Hooray Audix!                
Pouch and clip.                
Easy to get a nice kick sound.  Also good on open back guitar amps-mic the speakers as normal in front, then mic the rear of the cab/speaker with the D6.  Works for me, especially on a Deluxe Reverb or a Mesa 2x12 open back can.                
Heavy.                
Best $200 I've spent in a great while.                
dunno                
Yup.                
Kick ass mic.  Buy one or two.                
This is the best kick drum mic on the market. it gives a very nice attack, but not too much, lots of low end "oomph" without any eq. just throw this thing inside your kick drum and you are in business! I bought the shure beta 52 before this, and there is no comparison. the d6 blows it out of the water! the 52 stays on my floor tom now, where it does quite a nice job.
I also just used it on a bass cab along with a 57 for recording, and its the best bass sound i'v ever got.                
it's a mic....                
just put it on your kick, or bass cab and it sounds great! its smaller than the 52, and the clip isn't built in, so it can more easily be inserted into the bass drum, even with just a 4 inch hole, where the 52 could never get in properly.                 
solid aluminum construction, made in usa, need i say more?                
its cheaper than the 52, and it sounds way better                
haven't had to deal with them...                
it's beautiful.                
This product sounds amazing!  With a few minutes of tweaking on my board, the mic sounded so amazing!  It is the only mic I use for bass drums and cabs anymore!  If you have a couple hundred bucks, DEFINITELY go for this mic!! Two thumbs up!!                
The mic only came with a clip, and i had to by a stand and everything, but I got a great deal for it!                
Within a few minutes it sounds radio quality                
GREAT QUALITY!!!!                
Everyone uses this mic!                
AMAZING SOUND!!!                
These are great sounding drum mics at a great price!!                
I like these mics, as far as I can tell I like the sound of these better than the Senn set mainly on the floor toms, the D4 is way better than the E604 and comparable pricing, I like the clips these come with, I purchased 2 more, 1 for bottom snare for a sm57 and another for 2nd D4, case is nice the kick mic is great for the more attack heavy double pedal rock now but a little lacking in deapth for country and classic rock but can be eqd to suit.                
Zzounds.. Excellent speedy service. The DP series drum mics are amazing. D-6 kick mic has great deprh and punch as all the mics. The mic holders are the down fall of the pack. Spring tension is weak and does not fit on my Ayotte Custom kit with wood hoops. Needs a redesign with a lever to open up clamp. The mics sound awesome other wise.Thanks Scott Brokaw drummer for Day 41 Canton Michigan.                
Exceptional!                
The included clips for putting the mics on the drums are solid and easily adjustable.                
Very solid feel.                
Haven't had to use them.                
They have a high quality look to them and feel very solid.                
Seem very well built. Nice that the case comes with extra slots if I need to expand. Switchable Low cut filter and and pad on overheads very useful. Easy to level set and everything worked right the first time. The drummer for one of my bands has this set and as the sound guy I am very impressed with the clarity and lack of bleed through from this mic set. I needed drum mics for my other band and I had no hesitation in getting the Audix Mics.                
These microphones exceeded my expectations especially since I have used Shure, Sennheiser, AKG, and Audio Techinica mics for many years, these mics offer a new twist on the old workhorses.                
It is the best studio mic set up for drums ever. The only thing is buy a second Audix i5 to put on the bottom of the snare and you will have the perfect studio drumset up. There is already space in the case for another Audix i5, and another Audix D2, or D4 which is really cool.                
They are already compressed and eq'd for each drum great in the studio and amazing for live sound and live sound recordings.                
They really do work without any effects or mixing manipulation. The single can be recorded and go through mix down without anything being done to it. It really amazing.                
High quality, very sturdy and the drum mic clips are nice and can be either clipped to the drums or put on mic stands very versatile.                
You would pay alot more for a traditional SM57, Sennheiser 421, and some Rhones overheads which is traditional. Audix is a perfect example of a newer company using technology to build new standards in recording.                
Zzounds is the best music company out there in every way for support and customer service.                
They do look really nice, and the case is pretty sweet.                
Perfect drum mics for any application. Live Sound, Live Sound recording, or Studio Recording you can not beat these mics for the price.                
I have the Audix drum mic set and liked the dvice so much I ordered an extra to use on the bottom snare mic on a SM57, way better than using a mic stand.                
This item works well with compact mics only.  If you use a mic, such as shure sm57, it flops over.  Those mics are too heavy.  I have a set of compact mics that work great.  Had this item for over a year and works well. Springs still tight,goose neck still supportive. Gigs every weekend......                
Very east to use.                
Alittle pricey for what you get.                
Very similar to an SM57 but I find the i5 to be smoother in the upper frequencies. With my systems I tend to get more gain before feedback and better noise rejection with the i5s. I currently use i5s on batter side of snare drums, guitar cabinets, horns, and vocals and they just work well and sound great. It has become my favorite mic for mic'ing guitar cabs.                 
Wind screen and grill are tough and can handle being smacked by drummers or dropped by singers.                 
No switch, plug it in and go. I find it to be very flat and usually requires very little EQ'ing if any!                
I currently have 5 of these in my mic collection and they've been used expensively on stage and in my studio. They held up well, sound great, and have never failed me.                
Same prices as a 57, sounds better (IMO), and is more durable (again IMO).                
Haven't had to contact them.                
Eh, its black? Zero to little EQ'ing is very impressive, allows you to get an amazing sound very quickly even if your mixer/preamp is lacking in channel settings.                
I've used the i5 for years now and I swear by this mic. I've used 57s and many other dynamic mics, but I keep coming back to the i5. I just ordered another and figured I'd give my review on these wonderful mics.                 
Blows the SM57 out of the water on snare top, guitar cabs.
Pleasently surprised when we tried the i5 on a scratch vocal track-warm full sound on male voice. Equally surprised when we tried it in conjuction with a SDC on acoustic guitar.
The best "utility" microphone on the market.                
Umm...its a plain jane dynamic mic. No switches. Nice gold XLR connector though.                
Point and shoot...great.                
Solid constuction, awesome.                
Based on it's superior sound, the value is outstanding.                
Have not needed to contact Audix. 
That's a good thing, right?                
I have been doing a lot of guitar recording lately. I have been using Shure SM57s for years. I wanted to shake it up a bit, so I watched a boatload of reviews on youtube and read a ton of reviews on every forum available. There was one comparison on youtube that started with the I5 and i was immediately drawn to the tones. I ordered 2 from zZounds and have nothing but love. They kill. There are a lot of nice mics for recording guitar out there, dont get me wrong, but to my ear, The Audix i5 brings a considerably truer representation of what is coming out of my amp than ANY other 
mic I have tried. (many) it is built every bit as well as a 57, and it is clearly going to be durable. Buy one. Definitely a value.                
Excellent instrument mic for guitar cabs and snare drum.  Superb build quality and compact form factor.  Comparable to the venerable Shure SM57, to my ears they are close in response on guitar cabs and snare drums.   I do prefer them on snare versus the SM57 as the i5 capsule is protected by a sturdy metailic front end that stands up to errant and unintentional drum stick wacks.  I have 3 sidelined SM57s with the tops smacked off without any way to re-attach the plastic protective head covers.  It's frustrating. I am extremely satisfied with the Audix's performance to date.  Will definitely purchase several more to add to my Audix mic inventory.  I use the D series as my go to live mic system.  You cannot go wrong with purchasing this microphone.                  
Bought this with the Cab Grabber to get a little better control over our sound in live shows. Mic works great! Pretty versatile--sounds good no matter where I place it on the speaker. I like micing it very close and off center. That seems to work best with my guitar sound. 
Get the Cab Grabber, too--saves space and you don't have to worry about the mic moving around!                
I bought the i5 for harmonica jammin and i love it!!!                
No on-off switch                
Handled a wide variety of effects that I use on my harmonica                
Very sturdy                
Very good value                
not yet                
One of the slickset little mics I have ever used                
I am always looking for a mic with a better sound but I will always have one of these                
Great sound, replacing our SM57's for milking. Great quality reproduction and impressive vocal work as well.                
Like the man said, it's a mike, plug it in and speak!                
Very well made, Never did like the rotating head of the 57.                
Bought 5 of these for my band. Got a decent discount and the guys in the band loved the mike!                
Best mike I've used in a long time. Milking banjo's can be a tough job for any mike butthis one pulls it off like a champ.                 
Good sound tailored to drums, very little eq unlike with the Shure SM 57's. More on par with the Beta 57 but still with a little more clear sound and requiring less eq to find a sweets pot. Although not having tried it on brass seems like its frequency response curve will fit nicely with them too. I've used them on snare and tom drums only so far. The I5's will now be replacing the rest of the 57's on my church drums as they are a bit smaller and nicer sounding than the 57s.                
This is a very awesome mic.  I was kind of sceptical about getting it but I decided to go for it.  Seeing as how I don't want the generic 57 stamp on my products.  This has a very bright sound with enough body to make anybody happy.  I used it on snare and my snare just cut through the mix.  I did a side by side comparison with a 57 and with the pre's and faders at the same level, same eq it was a lot louder and clear sounding.                  
It came with a bag and clip, oh a sticker, almost forgot, a sticker.                  
You plug it in.  Its a microphone!                
Definately higher quality than a 57.  You could drop this off a building and it will probably work.  Maybe not look so good but probably work.  (I don't advise you to do so)                
I would have paid 200 for this microphone.  Definately worth the 100 dollars.                
I gave it a 5 cause I haven't had to deal with them yet.                  
Definately like design.  It looks like it has rear phase delay ports but they are definately running the same way as the microphone so it can't be.  Nice touch though.                
Most likely have this microphone for years to come.  Perhaps the new 57 if they market it right.                
It sounds like a 57 with a mid scoop....and the charts show that too, so no surprises there. it does have ALOT less handling noise, my feeling is that the rotating head/grill assembly on the 57 transfers minute vibrations. As far as output, it is about the same as the 57 i paired it against, but it takes EQ and FX better. Up close it has a more pronounced proximity effect than a 57, but it doesnt have the 'telephone-esque' sound that the 57 has, and therefore, sounds quite pleasant..it might even make a nice kick drum mic.                
 This mic is my new best friend.
Its sounds like a 57...except not. At first glance(or touch) it is noticebly heavier and more rugged than a 57, and being that it has an all metal shell, it could probably withstand a hard hit from a drummer or a drop to the floor much better too.                
 obviously more rugged than a 57, all metal shell, less handling noise. and it sounds good too!                
if you like 57's, you'll like this mic.....if not, then you probably arent reading this review.                
not needed.                
perhaps i will buy one or two more, to supplement my 57 collection.
as far as sex appeal goes, your kinky girlfriend might enjoy it.                
The Audix OM2 microphone is hands down the new "Industry Standard" vocal microphone. It's built like a tank, and will stand up to road use gig after gig. This is my second OM2, as the first one seemed to walk away after a gig. I highly recommend the OM2, over that other mic. The OM2 has a great proximity effect, and you will know when you find the sweet spot. If i had to own only one mic, this would be it.                
Mine came with a mic stand clip, and carrying pouch.                
Plug it in...                
The OM2 is a well balanced, superior built microphone. You can feel the quality the moment you pick it up. The sound is just wonderful. No feedback, and you can run it hot. This mic is well suited for almost any application, or venue.                
Best bang for the buck out there.                
Never needed to bother with support, i owned my first OM2 for about 5 years. I haven't yet to wear one out, or need support. But they do answer your emails, and phone calls right away.                
Just a great microphone, and an awesome price.                
Excellent mic. Better than the 58s I have used in the past. This mic is a great value. I bought the second one I own a day after I purchased the first one. A great mic mic made in the USA.                
After buying 3 SM58s when I was putting my PA system together for a band, I decided on a whim to buy this mic based on the favorable reviews. I tried it myself playing with my classic rock band, and it didn't seem to suit the music--so I stuck with the 58. It sat on my shelf until that band dissolved, and we formed a new band doing pop-rock with a young female singer. The 58 wasn't doing much for her, so I pulled out the OM2 and magic happened!!! Her high-midrange popped out in front of the mix just the way we wanted it to--and we use it everywhere we go, even on other PAs. More recently I tried the mic again myself, and realized that in the context of this genre, it helped my lead vocals as well. So if you have several different singers, and you're looking for a different sound than the classic 58, there's a good chance you might benefit from owning this mic.                
Cleaner than a Beta 58 with the same smooth character of a Sennheiser 845 but with more output.                
Good Mice Clip, nice Mic Bag with stand thread adapter.                
Pretty good right out of the box. Set the gain and you're good to go. Can be a little Bass Heavy with some voices. Hit the high pass and you're done.                
Build Quality comperable to the workhourse SM58. If it gets dirty just throw it in the wash, let air dry and you're good for the next gig - JK Road worthy Mic that can hold its own against all competitors.                
Great Bang for the Buck. You could pay more...but you won't be buying a better Mic.                
Audix has one of the Best Customer Support departments in the business. These guys are Mic Nuts. If you have an idea to make the product better (don't hurt yourself trying) give them a call and don't be surprised if you see an upgrade. Try that with the other guys...                
Great Black finish. Stands out from other mics. Slender design that is easy to hold. Has some heft to it. Feels expensive.                
I'll be using the OM3 for vocal and general purpose use for a loooong while. There is no such thing as the perfect mic or the "do it ALL" mic. Lets just say this is one that you should have in your Tool Kit if you plan on making money in Live Sound.                
I purchased these mics following recommendations from reviews posted here at zzounds and must say that I am thrilled with the purchase.  These mics are well constructed and have great volume output and feel.
I'm considering buying a few more.  They were a great deal as they came bundled with mic stands and cables.  I will definitely get much better quality cables as the ones included in the bundle are very flimsy.
Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.                
Worked very well as a combo tom-tom and cymbals mike for an outddor performance by my jazz quartet                
It's a mike. It works.                
Audix makes great stuff. I have a D4 I'm using on the electric bass and that works as well as this one.                
I haven't needed it.                
The over all sound quality is great I have not tried the om 5-7 but this one blows a sure sm 58 55 out of the water this is a great stage mic                
its light an durable                 
It's a mic if you have a learning curve Welll.....                
again its light an durable i have had mine for two years no problems                 
well worth it for the money                 
never a problem and as i have heard they don't have many quality issues Audix top notch company                
it is sleak                 
this mic will last for years to come next i am getting a om5 or a om7                
I don't use the microphone, the other guy in the duo does. But the microphone does what it's supposed to do. I use a Bose L1 system and this microphone works well with the Bose without any feedback, etc. The vocalist likes the sound of his voice through it. Sounds just like his voice. No complaints.                
I'd have given it a 10 if it had a built-in on/off switch. But then again, since I don't actually use it...                
Plug it in...use it.                
Quality looks to be first class.                
Since it does what it's supposed to do I think it is good value for the money spent.                
Don't know. Never had to deal with Audix support.                
It works great with the Bose L1. That's all that I'm concerned about. No need to replace it with anything else.                
The SM58 is dead long live the king..with so many fake shure 58s around and having been a victim of the scam..i tried a OM5 and i now have a OM7 as well..
the shure is 30 year old technology..the OM5 OM7 are american built each has a serial number..the price is right and they are FANTASTIC
i am a english buyer/user and they are not easy to find in the uk..i would not use a shure again                
excellent simple build quality                
what can you say ? relearn close proximity with the 7 just USE the 5                 
THE BEST                
would be happy to have paid full retail OM7 sells for 175 pounds in uk (approx $350)                
N/A do not forsee having to use any support                
N/A                
Always buying other microphones to test..fortunatly i can affort to do so..but these microphones are the standard to which ANY other would have to attain                
I have been playing out live since 1969 and still rock on the weekends in a classic rock band. I have used every mic out there from 58's, EV, AKG, Sennheiser, Blue and lots of others. Me and the other singer in the group both use Audix mics. They have superior sound reproduction, no feedback ever, no handling noise at all and they sound so much better than any of the 58's, regular or Beta. I use this Om5 and the other singer uses an Om3. He has a lot higher voice than me so the Om3 works better for him. I will not buy any other mic ever again and the other singer is only 30 yrs old and he swears this is the only brand mic he will ever own as well. Great job Audix and zZounds. 
This is awsome no feed back all the sound it performs                
I would perfer a hard case but what do you expect for the price                 
its solid                 
I think I have said what I think                 
I have never had to contact them there like matag waiting for some one to call                
I bought a handful of Shure 58's at the salesman's recommendation and then began reading about the Audix line of mics. For live performances at high volume with floor wedges, the OM5 was suggested as a better choice than the OM6.  The 7 series was not out at the time.  I gambled and bought 3 of the OM-5's and have never pulled the 58's out of the case since.  The OM-5's blow the 58's away. The mid range and presence is much more articulate, yet the low end sounds ballsy and full.  But the best thing about these mics is how well they reduce feedback. You can enjoy much higher monitor volumes than with other mics.                
I think the way the OM-5 minimizes feedback is the best feature of all.                
Seems to be built well. I take care of my stuff and have never had any mic fail me.                
Even though the OM-5's are a little more money than some of the competitor's products, they are well worth it.                
I haven't had a need to call but the web site and the printed documentation is more helpful than many other mic manufacturers.                
I bought the OM-5's and was so pleased I bought Audix drum mics too. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy the same mics.                
They work!                
these mics are famous for a reason. had mine for at least 7 years maybe 10. it always sounds great. has been thru many drops and other abuse but always works great. had many good comments from other guest vocalist as well. what goes in comes out. no coloration. no feedback.                
This mic is great! Have used the shure58 in the past, but a friend raved about this mic, so I gave it a try...
I am really impressed!                
It's a mic. Plug it in, and go...                
This mic is amazing! Gone are my on-stage worries about feedback. And I can hear myself better than ever before- even over a big band...
This mic solved my performance issues so all I have to worry about is singing... which isn't a worry any more!                
Sturdy. Solid. I would confidently recommend this product to anyone!
and, as the rep that bought it explained to me, the people at Audix really stand behind their products... If some meathead dropped your (audix) mic into a pitcher of beer, they will replace the "innards" for a reasonable fee. 
As for the casing, it's heavy and strong. I don't have any doubt that this mic will last a long time, and now that I have one, I will be back for more!
Did I mention it's made in Oregon? Small company? US of A? I know that Shure now makes it's mics outside the US... can't help but wonder how that affects the quality.
Go with Audix, I say!                
Yes!                
Haven't needed it. Which is what it's all about, really.                
Bonnie Rait and Willie Nelson own one...                
I haven't used a lot of different microphones. Just an Audix OM-5 and a Shure sm58. The sm58 is very popular and considered the industry standard for live microphones but every time I've compared them in a live setting the Audix OM-5 produces a noticable better vocal sound. The sm58 was demoted to miking the guitar amplifier a long time ago.                 
It plugs in, sounds great, and has low feedback response. What else are you expecting to find in a microphone?                
Mines been pretty beat up over the last few years. Hasn't affected the performance at all.                 
More expensive than my Shure sm58 but it was worth every penny. An extra fifty bucks isn't much for some you will still be using years down the road.                
Don't really know because I've never needed support from the company. That rates a 10 in my book.                
Looks good. Rugged black steel construction.                
No need to plan on replacing this item because I would just buy another one (maybe I'd consider the OM-6 or OM-7). This microphone has been a trusty companion. I've never regretted buying it and never considered replacing it. There aren't too many pieces of equipment I can say that about.                 
its just amazing that these are priced so low i would have paid alot more for them                
a great way for some better sound quality i would recomed to anyone                
I have never used sound absorption foam but had seen it talked about plenty so much so that finally I decided to purchase some and see for myself rather or not it would help to make the playback area of my music studio a better listening environment. I had a few weeks earlier come across another audio item I had wished to purchase here at zZounds and did, and seen also they carry sound absorption foam, but, which brand, and type to try? Well I went with Auralex and am happy with doing so, and so far the results I am getting after installation is great so much so that I had to make another order of two cases/ 2 Packs of Auralex 2 Wedgie 12x12 Tiles (24 Pack) X 2 This time.                
When I first decided to make a purchase of this brand sound absorption foam pads for my home sound recording studio/Music Studio, I was very unsure of the results I would get. The results I have actually received are satisfying enough to say they work at subduing and absorbing reflections of sound produced from my monitors and help me to hear what i'm producing so much the better than without the use of them. Well worth the money invested into them.                
Very useful in studio environment as it takes away possible vibrations coming from the floor. Also, useful for live settings. Have you ever played on a stage made of 1/4" plywood? The rattle from the plywood goes away if you put your cab on top of a GRAMMA mat. Try it! After trying it, you will not go back.                
Simple and straightforward. You put them up in your corners, and away goes the bass droning. Can't get any better than that. One downside - they don't come with anything to actually put them up. They come with a piece of paper describing options for glues and other means of getting them up, but that's it. I can't objectively rate Manufacturer support as I haven't had to use them.                
I have the BIG KRK 10's (3 way monitors) these things are 55lbs each speaker!  
The bass is crazy loud which has tons of vibration!
I have these monitors on my workstation desk of course (they don't fit on stands) and without the pads things on the desk hop around..For example, if I set a water bottle on the desk without the foam pads, that water bottle falls over, no joke.
With the foam pads, the water inside the water bottle doesn't even shake!  
I had fun with this, almost like the termpur pedic bed things with the wine glass!
Overall, these are great..A bit pricey considering you can buy a block of foam from thefoamfactory.com for only $20 and cut it yourself but hey, if you want to spend the money on these it is worth it!  I suggest these to anyone with large monitors/sub woofers!  It also helps with the sound, everyone knows vibration kills your audio!
Get these, you won't be dissapointed!
Visit my youtube channel for reviews, I will have a video on these very soon!
youtube.com/bonezproductionz                
This, for me, is the most important part of the review.  The quality of the sound is why we pay money for these products.  I am pleased to say that the MoPads made a big difference immediately upon placing my studio monitors upon them.  
The most noticeable difference came in the decoupling of the speakers from the desk upon which they had been resting.  The desk was causing reinforcement of the vibrations at certain frequencies (especially bass frequencies) and just generally rattling.  
The MoPads stopped almost all coupling to the desk, except at the lowest frequencies (I'd say below 100 Hz by ear).  The desk no longer vibrates, buzzes, or reinforces vibrations and the result is much crisper cymbals, clearer mids, and no more boomy bass. 
Of course, I still get boomy bass from the walls, but that's for another day...                
Well, the product is just four blocks of foam, but it does allow one to choose from 5 different angles for the monitors depending on the way a wedge of foam is oriented on the MoPad.                 
I can't really tell what a well made foam would look like.  It certainly seems that foam would be a good choice of material for this application.                
I give the value only a 4, because even though the product works, I feel that $30 is a bit steep.  This foam may not be much different from that used in Auralex's wall treatments, which is only $3 a square foot.  
If these were included with a roominators kit for an extra ten dollars on top of the regular roominators price, I'd say the value would be better.                  
Haven't needed it.                
definitely sexy, I'd made sure to have the auralex logos facing the room so everyone can see how much I paid for good sound!                
I am satisfied with this product, it did what the "hype" said it would.  I plan to purchase further products from Auralex based on my experience with the MoPads.  
If you have problems with monitors vibrating their stands or a desk, these are a good, albeit expensive, solution.  A block of rubber might do the trick more cheaply, I don't know...                
the sound coming from my speakers are truely what is recorded. no surface coloration nor any unwanted buzzing. simply amazing items.                
as far as usefulness these little pieces of foam have changed the way i listen to even my home stereo, i am no going to have to isolate all my speakers from the surfaces they sit. the foam is quite an attraction to animals that like soft chewables, so keep them protected from access. side note.                
the foam pieces are quite a puzzle to set up but worth the small effort considering the major pay off. the set comes with four sets of foam, with three pieces per set. so the size of your speaker foot print does not matter you just move the pieces around and then set the speaker on top, move speaker and repeat until they are set up.                
again, precision cut foam is not easy to do with out the proper equipement, so i would have to say the quality is very good.                
worth every dollar.                
have not needed any but in the package there is some useful information and the company will assist with room set up if you send information to them have not tryed this but it seems for the right person with more cash then myself it would be quite useful                
very cool looking with the company logo on one front piece helps with the whole left, right thing.                
I was a little sceptical at first. Forty dollars for some foam, but what a difference they make. First thing, the foam is precision cut, first rate, all pieces match the opposite side which is not easy to do. I can set up my speakers exactly they way they need to be for maximum sound. The foam also isolates the speakers so there is no surface fibration, I did not need to place self adhesive feet on the bottom of my speakers.                
Cool pads. Great for producing/mixing. They slightly close in the soundstage of your monitor and direct the music energy more forward out the speaker. Good quality. The foam is definitely treated. Very noticeable compared to regular container foam.                
I brought this product and I loved it from the beginning, however I couldn't justify the cost of this product. So I called Zzounds and got an RA number to return it. The problem occurred when I removed the pads from the speakers, I instantly noticed the tremendous vibration and the noise associated with it. I still have a problem with the cost but I cannot use my speakers as desk speakers without them. These Isolation Pads are incredibly dense and do not lose their shape when speakers are placed on them. It is the denseness of this product that makes it so desirable with the ability to control vibrations from speakers producing lots of bass .                
do you have some powered monitors on your studio desk? throw these bad boys on it and hear what a difference it make. my desk has stopped the ratlle and it feels like the sound are more direction toward me and not swimming around the room. looking at the MoPad you wouldn't think it would do anything..but no its totally worth the cash for a sound geek :P                
I was a bit skeptical of the pads but a friend said I needed an insulator for "true sound". sure enough these really cleaned up the sound (much more than I anticipated).                
greatly reduces vibration                
well it does the job.....and the spare cutout pieces of foam I used under my Macbook pro and the others under my midi controller                
cake                
pretty strong and durable......dont think i could really rip it......maybe if it was rubbed on a corner of a desk I could see it tearing                
2 sets came with my Yamaha HS50s.......along with 2 stands.......pretty money if you ask me..............but I prolly wouldnt go buying MoPADs for 40 bucks each......I mean eggcrate foam would work just fine but it wouldnt look as pretty                
N/A                
yea its very practical                
these will prolly last me a long time........If i get more monitors Ill prolly have to get more MoPads                
Hosnestly at first I thought the MoPads were kind of high priced when I first looked at them, but after purchasing and using them with my monitors I have to say they are definitely worth the price.                
There is no sound, it keeps things quiet as it should.                
Extra pieces of foam so the monitors can be set level or angled.                
Strong. I stood on 'em just to see if they could support the weight, and they did.                
Highly valued.                
Never used 'em. Which is good.                
I need it.                
Does what it said it would do, which is all I ask.                
I was worried it wasn't going to be enough to cover my room but it ended up being plenty. Does wonders for the sound of the room they are hung in. I was hoping (not expecting) for some "Sound proofing" (as in keeping sound only in the same room as the speakers) but this doesn't do much in that department. Makes THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE on my microphone recordings. Well worth the $$$$. Not to mention the visual pleasure I get walking into the room their hanging in. Looks and sounds professional. Wish it wasn't so expensive, but you get what you pay for! Still waiting for the "Foam pit" smell to leave my room. I only notice when I first walk into the room and it is starting to dissipate after a couple weeks.                
I think this is the best stage mic you can get.  Better than Shure Beta 87A, Better than AKG D3900 and Better than Sennheiser E865 and about as nice as Neumann KMS105 for a lot less.  I have used them all, and I'll stay with this one.                
Includes mic clip.  Useful switches.  Often you'll need to engage the low end roll-off in live applications.                
Feels rugged and durable to me.  I haven't dropped it yet                
Again, I like it better than Neumann KMS105, and my AE5400 cost a lot less.                
Looks fantastic                
The AE5400 is exactly what I was looking for: a hi quality, reliable and durable stage mic. I've been using a Shure Beta 87a for two years and really digging that, but just wanted to try to step up a notch. The AE5400 does it. Full-body sound, crisp high's, lots of detail (I sing jazz and pop for grown-ups), and it just feels nice and solid when handling. I've used it on only one gig so far, but at first blush, it's a total winner. A colleague sat in on my gig (awesome vocalist!) and he sounded amazing on this mic too. ZZounds held to their "beat any price" claim and gave me a screaming deal, plus, the shipping was super fast. ZZounds is my new favorite source!                
I've owned this mic for about three years. During that time I've performed in every situation other than an arena. That includes the bars with a useless sound guy, the clubs with an excellent sound guy, the outdoor festival with no sound guy at all, the theaters with perfect acoustics and pristine sound system, and of course the cramped practice space. I've used it a lot. This mic is best performing dynamic I've used.
Having used the Shure SM58 and Beta 58a, Electrovoice n/d 767, Audix OM2 and OM5, and the Sennheiser e835, I'd say I have a pretty good basis for comparison.
The 6100 rejects feedback as well or better than any of these. The transients cut straight through, and the clarity is unrivaled.
I sang with a super loud heavy progessive/metal band. Whisper to scream, the 6100 shines.                
Superb clarity, incredible feedback rejection. Oh, and it handles plosives amazingly well.                
Hypercardioids have a slightly higher learning curve. You have to keep on them tightly, or else you're lost. That said, the 6100 reacts amazingly well to "playing the mic." That's something all singers should do with their mic.
Spend some time with it, develop a relationship with it and you won't be disappointed.                
Let's bring up the really important point -- How durable is this thing? I've thrown it, I've dropped it. It's lived through fog filled venues, dusty outdoors festivals, smoke filled rehearsal spaces... Not a scratch, and it still sounds incredible.
Buy this mic.                
Best gear investment I've made as a singer.                
Never needed to talk to them. I love Audio Technica. I also own an AT4050. Incredible mics.                
This thing stands out from the crowd. Not the "golfball on a stick" look we've seen from Shure, or the blacker than black from Audix. Has a look and feel all it's own. I like that the grip isn't just rounded. It makes for a better hold.                
I won't replace this mic ever. It won't need to be replaced. I will however purchase the ae5400, but as an additional color for my vocal spectrum, not a replacement or upgrade.                
This is a great sounding entry level mic.
To get the most out of this mic, you need to turn up the pre on your channel strip until you can hear yourself breathing in the cans, and step back so you are between 1 and 2 feet away from the mic.  you have to keep a distance.  use a pop filter if it helps you to remember.  If you are right on top of the mic, even at lower gain levels, you will experience problems.
This mic will pick up subtle nuances that you didn't even realize were present in the performance.  It will also make you keenly aware of noise in the environment.                
If you are even involved in a deathmatch on an alien world, and you have to choose just one microphone with which to bludgeon an alien creature into a green paste; the AT2020 is the one you should choose.  
It's heavy, it's quite sturdy, and it'll only cost you around a hundo to replace it - so it doesn't raise your blood pressure every time it comes out of the case.
Build quality aside, if you are reading this you're probably wondering if the mic is any good.  This is an excellent recording microphone, but it's not going to work as well for live performances.  Get yourself a Shure SM58 for that.
The mic does a good job of rejecting sounds coming from behind the mic - a good feature when you're trying to bring in as little extraneous noise as possible.                
You're really getting a lot of value for your cash with this one.                
The mic just looks great, and has a pleasing heft.                
If you are looking at this mic you are probably just getting started in home recording, and wondering if it's worth the $100.  You don't want to spend a lot of money, but you don't want to end up with a completely useless piece of junk.  
I purchased this microphone about 5 years ago, for more than twice what it's selling for here - and I've never once regretted it.
There are better microphones out there, but you're not going to find them at this pricepoint.  There are cheaper microphones out there, but they don't come close in terms of quality.
For the starting recordist, this microphone offers tremendous bang for the buck.                
It sounds really good, at this price range i dont believe there is any other that can beat the at2020, sounds very clear, havent tested with instruments cause i'm a lead singer of a rock band, and i bought it just for recording vocals, but still i'll try it next rehearsal. it looks as good as it sounds.                
got tell you, the one thing i really dont like is the mic suport for the stand that comes with it, this product deservs shock mount, or at least a small case for safe keeping, other than that it's a very simple straight forward mic                
just plug in to phantom powered source and rock on.                
at this price, wow, it's really good, it looks very sexy, well builted, rubst, great design, it stands out in our studio, it sounds fantastic.                
again, in this price range, the best                
dindt really need support                
very sexy very appealing, it seems ultra professional.                
for now this complements my colection of Shure and AKG dynamic microphones, and i hope that i'll never had the need to buy any other. this will do for now, and i feel that it will work for a long time.                 
This mic sounds good for the price. Overall it does capture the true sound of vocals and acoustic guitars. Haven't tried micing any cabs yet but I'm confident it'll get the job done. Has a tendancy to be heavy on the bass end but this was easily fixed by changing the position until I found the sweet spot.                
Stand adapter and vinyl storage pouch is included.                
Built extremely well. Rugged and durable. Even the stand adapter is quite impressive...                
Definitely worth every cent. For under $100.00 bucks ya can't go wrong!                
Haven't needed them thus far so I remain neutral.                
I'll keep it forever! Can never have to many mics...                
sound quality is great, i was reading over ratings and noticed they said it sounded muffled, it was most likely because they had the mic backwards. this mic actually has a front and back to it. so make sure u are pointing it in the right direction and you will not have a problem. it labeled on the mic itself. other than that, sounds fantastic and clear.picks up everything so make sure you do use it in a booth. when i first got this mic i used it in my closet and picked up my neighbors talking.                 
very well built, had mine going on 4 years. took it on an overseas tour, and still work great. this mic has been through alot and sounds Exactly the same way when i bought. so you WILL not have to worry about this bad boy getting damaged at all. this mic has seen war.                
This is unbeatable for the price, i have dealt with other mics and i would have to say that this mic is worth alot more than what its priced.                
VERY VERY SEXY, has a nice wieght to it also. i own it.                
overall it's a very good mic for its price and recommend any that wants that great sound and feel to their vocals to get this mic. "NOTE FOR BEGINNERS" just cuz a mic sounds good doesnt mean you do not have to put eq on it.                
  This microphone gave me the best experience I could've hoped for. It was way better than I thought it would be. My friend owns a more expensive mic and still my AT2020 gives better quallity. With the right settings on your preamp and/or interface, this will give you a great bang for your buck.                
When I bought the AT2020, it came with an AT2021 microphone. Still good quallity but it wasn't as great in my opinion.                
It's so easy to start up. I have it set up in my room (I record in my closet). Just hook the microphone up to the preamp. My set-up is Microphone>PreAmp>M-Audio Fast Track Interface (USB)> Computer and Whala!                
Hands down top of the line quallity. I don't have a professional studio but this microphone gives my music a professional sound.                
It's very much worth the price                
Yes.                
Just the look of it says "perfection".                
I'm going to use this microphone until it dies.                
This is a great mic.  Absolutley great.  For $100 (and mine came with a free set of really nice headphones)it is an amazing value.  This mic is powerful loud, watch your levels.  Like all good mics, feedback needs to be contained, I am not able to go open mic with monitors on in my garage studio so untill I build a proper studio I am limited to headphone monitoring. This mic picks up everything, including the faint dim of the neighbors washing machine.  Really nice, you won't be dissapointed.  
I use 2 of these back to back to record middle school vocal groups, the singers postioned in 2 opposing semi-circles.  All vocals are clean and loud.  By the way, take a look at Shure web site for suggestions on mic techniques, I find it really helpful.                 
I accidentlty dropped it on a concrete floor, no harm no foul but not a good idea.                
It's no wonder that this mic is gaining appreciation and becoming a studio standard. I now have a pair of these mics. My first one I bought cause I heard a lot of good things about it. I was a little skeptical it being an electret condenser not a true condenser, but was pleasantly surprised  by the non metallic, tinny sound that electrets are known for. Some of the live stage AT electrets also have a somewhat dull, too flat sound too. It doesn't have quite the presence peak of a Neuman U87, but a more subtle sparkle. It's a very wide range throughout the audio spectrum with a gradual rise in the higher frequencies that start at about 5khz. to 8khz.  It  has a very smooth response, with no sharp spikes or dips. It is a no frills mic. There's no attenuation pads, bass roll offs, figure eight patterns or flashing lights like the U87's or AKG 414 or whatever. It's also a mid sized diaphargm not large as I've seen it advertised, yet it still maintains a lot of low end which gives it a warm sound. sibalence is minimal (that's those hard "S" sounds you hear and get from a lot of mics). It can handle a lot of SPL's and haven't had anyone's voice over modulate it. It is very quiet mic, very little noise. I use them mostly for recording vocals and as overheads for drums. They would work well also as a room ambient mic for guitar amps or whatever.  I'd stick with 58's or 57's or similar for miking the grill of your speakers though. Haven't tried a pair in front of some Leslie speakers yet, but I think it'd be worth a shot. Got some good sound with a pair in stereo miking a choir. I don't think it would make a good stage mic, too sensitive. I used to own a 24 track studio, remember 2 inch Ampex 456 tape? I've gone digital since those days, lol.  I'm not saying this is of the same caliber as a U87 or tube Telefunken, but believe it or not, it comes pretty close. And for the bucks, wow!  For those just starting to record or those on a budget, this is a good way to step up your game. For the full blown pros out there, these would make a nice addition to your arsenal. I realize that we're all different, we have different tastes, not everyone will love this mic.Personally, I think they're great for the price.                
This is an awesome mic for the price.  I use mine for professional commercial voice-overs.  Teamed with a dbx286 channel strip, I get really clean recordings that fit my voice just right.  You will need a pop filter and a quiet recording space, this little guy is sensitive and will pick up any room or ambient noise.  I love it and see no reason to replace it with a more expensive model, as it works so well for what I do.                 
I work in a comercial studio. I bought the mic for doing stuff at home. I wanted to try it out in a real gig. I did a radio spot with it, using it on the voice-over and it did fine. I recorded accoustic guitar with it also and it did good there also. This little mic has a sound you can trust. The smaller capsule doesn't produce a too edgy sound. It is in fact quite smooth and pleasing. I'm used to tracking with a Neumann m149 wich is about 50 times more expensive. Of course, the Neumann sounds more articulate and alive... But the AT2020 gave a pleasing, easy to mix source with controled bass and smooth highs. With a good pre, this little trooper can replace an expensive mic without anybody (an add agency in this case) noticing a difference. No joke!  To close, let's just say that if it doesn't sound good, it won't be cause of this mic. Love it!                
I gave 6. I could have given 8 or 2 for that matter. Sure, it could have had a 10db pad, a HP switch, selectable patterns... Who cares! You put it up and it sounds great and at 100$ a pop that is a hell of a feature!                
doesn't apply                
For the price? Great.                
Wow!                
doesn't apply                
good sound is sexy                
I'm keeping this baby, and for all the projects I do at home, it more that qualifies! A small studio can produce pro quality with a mic like this.                
After a week of putting it through the all paces recording a wide variety of applications, I am extremely pleased and impressed with the performance and versatility of the AT2020. It performed well with a variety of different vocalists and acoustic guitars with and without being plugged into my favorite, the Focusrite ISA 1 preamp, as well as being plugged directly into a Presonus Audiobox 44 VSL with little to no EQ treatments. And it really SHINED placed properly in front of my Fender(s), Marshall, and Line 6 electric guitar amp cabinets. And being I’m a firm believer in there’s no such thing as a silver bullet “One size fits all” mic, that’s a lot to say about any mic at any price.  Keeping in mind this is an ultra-cheap a no frills studio quality mic, Audio Technica has kept the price down simply by offering a straight forward fixed cardioid large diaphragm condenser mic, with no switching for pads or polar patterns, being it can handle a whopping 144db SPL, there doesn’t seem to be any compromise in sound quality with the proper mic placement.Last but not least, THANK YOU zZounds, your services and shipping are not only second to none, they are at the standard at which I judge ALL others by, I’m SMIL’IN! :o)                
I was reading other people's reviews and i decided to purchase this product.  I must say that it sounds really good!!  I compared it to ME's V57M and it annihilates it by far. I use it only for vocals (so far) and my recording comes out clean!! I have it connected to my M-Audio MobilePre USB device ($149.95 on this site) along with using my SE Electronics Reflexion Filter (about $299 on this site).  Plus you don't really need a shock mount for it (if they offered one for it, it would be a plus).  I was surprised by how much this mic can do....in my room!!! Overall, using the right equipment and using the mic right, it sounds professional.  This is a condenser mic so you will need to have 48v Phantom Supply for it, make a booth or buy a reflection filter from this site or else your sound will be garbage.                
Well....as far as features go....The clip mount it comes with only allows you to hook it up on certain mic stands.  The reason for this is because the stand's pipe end you screw it on has to be relatively smaller than some stage mic stands or others. Other than this its nice and sturdy and has a firm joint for when you bend it to position your mic however you want it.                
Just plug it in and play really!!                
It's nice and sturdy, built like an ox made outta metal!! It's the complete opposite of fragile.  Im sure this mic will last atleast 15 years or so.                
For the value, this is absolutely the best buy for your home studio!!! $100 for CD-quality sound.....are you serious??!!! This is a steal!!!!                
Im rating it 10 but dont follow this rating because I never did need support.....atleast not yet.                
I love the way it looks!! Not to big or too small....nice texture, finish, and design......Not flat-like....its beautiful!!                
This product is a absolute must-have!! Forget about buying expensive mics and get this one.....you wont regret it. I see more AT mics getting their way into my home/studio.  Believe this review and forget the others because Im telling you the realness!!                
I was 100% happy with this product.  I use this for doing VO recording for animation at home or in an office and it gives great quality sound.  I actually needed a second mic at one point so I bought the AT 4040 which coste $150 more, and I prefer this one.                
A bit of an amateur so I'm using this witht the Lambda Lexicon preamp and it works great.                
extremely easy to set up and use with preamp.                
I've had this for about 2 years and it's still working great.                
Like I said, I think it works as well or better than other mics that cost much more.                
Never had to use support so far.                
Its works great and its cheap.                
See first comments                
AT2020 sounds very good on classical and acoustic guitar and vocals. Decent sound on shakers but would not be my first choice for them. Vocals have almost no proximity effect with this mic, but guitar gets it quite strong. You have to be careful about mic technique and roloff the base using an EQ since it has no bass-roloff switch. Noise is around 20dB as advertised. This is OK for a home studio mic.                
Nice pouch; comes w/o shockmount which is a minus. Also you can't buy one since the optional shock mount AT offers costs $75, i.e 3/4 the price of the mic. I find this ridiculous.                
Rugged and well built. Meets and exceeds the flat frequency response in the specs (picks up to 22kHz). A word of caution for studio pros is that with a 16-mm diaphragm this is not a real large-diaprhagm mic. It shares the same diaphragm with AT2021 small-diaphragm mic, it's just mounted in a cylindrical box commonly used for large-diaphragm condensers. Again, it sounds great, but I am not so sure I would have bought it if I knew this before. On the other hand the smaller diaphragm makes the mic suitable for close miking (6-8"), at larger distance doesn't sound as good, but for home studio this is a plus since you avoid the acoustic coloration of untreated recording rooms. In my case this is a plus.                 
Good for home studios.                
Haven't had to deal with them                
Very clean, very clear. I got it with the instrument mic package deal.
If you have a budget but you need a mic that sounds WAY past it's price range this is the one...                
Large-diaphragm, cardioid condenser.                 
Simple... if you know how to use your interface.                
Tough mic, i could throw it at a wall five times, plug it in and make rad vocal recordings...                 
For the money it doesnt get better... at least I dont think...                
never dealt with                
very sexy mic                
For the money its the best...                
best acoustic guitar mic you can get for under $400.  at around $100 it's a steal, get a pair for $200, then buy more mic stands, cables, and other toys for the rest of your change.
I use it professionally and it works great and almost every guitar I've recorded, better than cheap competition like the SP B1 and other LDC mics, since the 2020 is SDC it handles transients better and has less bass build up from the sound hole, much much more even guitar pickup, very complimentary, and GREAT rear and side rejection.                
it's a mic, it works great, wish they threw in a shockmount.  that would make it a 10.                
easier to place for acoustic guitar than most other mics.  all positions works well, 12th fret aimed at sound hole is amazing though.                
better built than any competing manufacturers of cheap mics, and as well built as a way more expensive AT4050, one of the more common pro studio mics you can get from the same company.                
best deal going for an acoustic guitar mic, good for other uses as well.                
no problems, no support issues, so it's a 10.                
fairly sexy mic for the money, way better built than apex, nady, mxl, or other chinese mics.                
just get one.                
awesome sound. picks up as much as you throw at it and then some. i record vocals mainly with this, but i have done a few acoustic guitar sessions as well. great sound. my only small complaint is how, imo, it picks up a tad too much higher end, but with some slight EQ, you can make this sound incredible (for the price, that is)                
nice little pouch and great stand adapter                
this things a rock                
for under $100???? BUY THIS                
never had to use it                
whats not to like? looks beautiful up on its stand. a great addition to my set up.                 
buy this thing. like the other guy said, you can never have too many mics, and this is a perfect addition to anyones studio. the sound is great, and im sure this thing will never break. for under $100, you can't miss                
I have only owned dynamic mikes until now. Wow, for my purposes-recording an acoustic guitar and vocals-this mike is awesome. Only rated a 9 because I am sure that their are better  sounding mikes, but super as far as I am concerned.                
The adapter is fine. I had trouble figuring out the proper size. The standard adapter comes with an insert to reduce its diameter. Needed to unscrew it to increase opening size and I was good to go. Took me a few to realize as the paperwork that came with the mike didn't point out the adapter within an adapter. Others have stated that they wish that it had come with a shock-mount. So far for me, no problems                
Plug into preamp and you are good to go. Yet, see comment above about adapter.                
solid as a rock                
incredible bang for the buck                
haven't needed it, but had to give a number...lol                
Solid and sounds great, all for an incredibly low price                
I'll be brief: This microphone is top quality and phenomenal value for money. The only downside was the stand. I only use my mic for about 2-3 days per month, so I disassemble it and reassemble it after these sessions. I've only had the mic for about 4 months and already the stand has fallen apart; the thread used to hold the microphone is totally ineffective.                
I ordered a (Blemished) Audio-Technica AT2020 Condenser Mic for my home studio. It arrived arrived in 2 days but was found to be bad when tested (High noise floor w/ low output). I was pretty upset but only momentarily because when I contacted zZounds they apologized and sent a pre-paid UPS return ticket telling me they would ship a brand new Mic out. I re-boxed the bad Mic, dropped the box off down the street and 2 days latter I was enjoying my Brand Spanking New Microphone. It's been a great experience dealing w/ zZounds.com. I got a new Mic for almost half price.                  
The sound of this mic is commendable at its price.  It is a bit crisp on the high end, but that is what you get with a mic priced this low. For a home studio I would fully recommend this mic.                
Its a mic. Thats it. Thats all it should be                
It would have been bettwer with a shock mount than the clip they sent                
For the price, you can't beat it.                
It's a studio mic! It's a no-brainer!                
For $99 you can't beat it! It's a great mic for normal use. If I'm looking for superior sound quality I'll go with a much better model. The sound reproduction though is clear.                
Haven't needed to contact their support so I can't comment.                
Sweet! I'd definitely buy it again if I needed another studio mic.                
I'll keep it until something goes wrong, but I think it'll last a while.                
Very surprised at the crispness of the mic.                   
I bought this Mic for guitar amps.....it sucks....so much so I was about to return it. Then I decided I would try singing into it... Wow....I was blown awsy. The clarity edge definition very good. Gave my voice a surreaL sound...better than my beta58, my AT handheld condensor, my adk s7b, am57, beta87a.....and so on.....I am really surprised. I did only run it through a presonus tube channel strip though.                
No highpass filter no -10db too omnidirectional......                
A little low end boost a little .mid boost, a little high end cut, a pop filter, boom!                
Ehhh we'll see....                
If you want to spend 500 on Mic and pre for vocals you would be hard pressed to find a better combo than this Mic and presonus tube channel. Gotta get a nice preamp too compress eq and get some tube warmth too really get it going but hey its unbelievable when you do.                
Dunno                
It's a good Mic....there's probably better but for 100 budget Mic its pretty good!                
The mic worked for awhile but caused computer crash. I bought it at Guitar city
on W.14th St. NYC. who advised me that it was compatible with windows 7.
they would not let me return it for "hygienic" reasons. I'm still trying to find a use
for this mic but feel I've been "rooked" What else doesn't it function with. By the
way the computer was ruined.                
I play a 3/4 upright 1948 Kay bass and the sound is perfect. Just like the bass sounds like . I have played with other mics but the sound was not there. When i bought the mic I was worried the I heard it . WOW!!!!!!!!. Just wish I had another.perfect mic
thanks so much Jeff                
yes                
I cant afford no $300 mic, so bought this and I was shocked with the sound. I like this one alot, you can not expect this to sound an Sony C800, but its good tho.                
I am not a professional, so maybe I'm outta my league on a review and I just don't know what I'm talking about. I paid $150.00 for my AT2020, and although it is a better clearer sound than the less expensive condenser mic I have, To me the sound is still a bit muffled, And of course the Decibal range isn't quite what I would like it to be, if you sing a little too loud you still get the slight distortion, although not near as much as a regular old cheap mic. Still not sure I'm happy with it, I'm wondering if i can't actually get something even better for $150, since it seems most people only paid $100 for their AT2020. I'm undecided.                
I do like the sturdiness, feels durable.                
very easy, I didn't need anything but a usb port on my regular desktop comp.                
I think I got jipped                
Explained above. I've only had it 2 days and looking to return it for something that might just sound a little better. I use it for singing, but not professianlly. I do it as a hobby.                
does it really get better than this?                
came with a pouch and a mic stand mount... i wish it came with a shockmount but i cant complain cuz the mic sounds like its worth 300$ anyways lol..u can get one from the same company for like 50 bucks                
just plugged it in                
i dropped it a couple of times on a hard wood floor and it still works                
are they really giving these away this cheap?                
dont need it                
very sleek and sexy                
overall im very satisfied with this mic ive owned one other by samson and this blows it away..                
This microphone is great for a beginners. The quality is great as long you have the right stuff and know what you doin. For what i use the mic is sounds awesome couldn't ask for a better mic. I heard some good microphones like the akg but AT by far has a more crips sound.                
The Microphone has no flaws.                
Is pretty simple how to get this mic going is a microphone.                
Its a great microphone. I bring in alot of artist and they all tend to sound nice on it. I've had it for like 4 months and it still rocking with me and it has taken a couple hits.                
Its a great mic cuz i know the microphone is worth alot more than what you paid for.                
Never had to call.                
Its sexy and is black.                
I have a studio so i keep buying better stuff and higher end prices but this mic is has a certain pitch that others don't.                
The sound is perfect, very clear and sounds just like a real expensive condensor mic! MAKE SURE YOU GET A POP FILTER. HELPS OUT A LOT!                
Yea accessories are ok. Just wish it had a shockmount with it.                
The use of this product is amazing.                
The quality seems almost perfect. Just I know there is better so I gave it a 9. Make sure you get a pop filter.                
This mic is the best value for your money by far. You will be happy.                
Support can not be any better.                
This item looks wonderful on the stand with a pop filter.                
This product was prob the best mic I could have got for my money. I would want this mic for a long time. It is wonderful.                
Really clear sound. I really love the sound quality of this mic, especially for its affordability.                 
It would be great if it came with a shock-mount, rather than just a regular plastic mount.
Otherwise, it just came with the mic and the case. It does the job.
The mic is very plug-and-play, so not much else was needed.                
Plug and play! Super easy.                
Considering the price, I'd buy 7 of these. I only need 1 or 2, and if i'm spending 700, i ought to get a good one.
Oh well. It's solid. I'm sure it could be thrown on the floor and not be damaged. Easily as strong as an SM58.                
Amazing. This is only 40 bucks more than my old condensor (cheap Apex435) and it's leaps and bounds above the old one. Super improvement, for so little cash.                
Haven't had to deal with it, so that's a good sign.                
Sexy. Black. Phallic. Good.                
Get one.                
I was really impressed. I work with condensers of Rode and the dynamic mics of Shure.This was the first time I was using an Audio Technica and I think more mics of this brand will follow in my studio. The AT2020 gives a neutral rich but still a warm sound and could be used for a large scale of vocals. If you are looking for a reliable and great sounding condenser mic extra, you have found a great bargain.                
For the price, there are not much accessoires included. A spider shockmount could be desireable.                
Plug it in on a mixing console with 48 v phantom power and you can record. I use this mic on my Allen and Heath mixing console, and it sounds fantastic.                
The solid and rugged body gives the mic expensive looks. this makes it also a reliablemic for on the road.                
No comments, just buy oneand use it, you wont regret it.                
I have not dealt with the company.                
If AT stays delivering this kind of quality products, I will probably buy more.                
I use these for live sound with international folk musicians and they are by far the best sounding vocal mikes I've used for the price, especially for vocalists that don't have as much on the high end.  They're good for some folk instruments as well, and handle high SPL's almost as well as dynamics.  I'm getting two more to take the place of a couple more of my SM58's.                
Wish these had an acoustic isolation mount that fit them.                
Couldn't be easier with a phantom power mixer, and the sound quality responds well to the input EQ's.  As with most phantom-power condensers, though, an XLR cable with an open wire will allow a little signal through on the ground shield, so if you're used to dynamics, you might not catch a bad cable.  (Got bitten by that myself, but if anything, it's a case of the mike working a little *too* well.)                
Fit and finish are decent, good for home studio/light stage use.  I wouldn't use these for a high volume rock band, they're a little delicate for that kind of work, but they're great for acoustic or folk music.  The mounts are rock solid and work well with boom stands, and setup/takedown is quick and easy.                
Well worth it for the price.  I'm getting more of them because they're good condensers.                
Wow! That was the first word that came to mind after listening to this mic. I am a professional voice over artist, and I have recorded at some great studios with great mics like the vaunted Nuemann U87, Senny, 416 shotgun, AKG mics, etc., and I can safely say this one is in my top 3. I was ready to pull the trigger on an AT4033CL, however after reading that this one was very comparable and sounded as good as other mics costing upwards of $500, I bought the AT2035. I did not regret my decision. I paired it with a Presonous tube amp, and was blown away. Nice, crisp highs and mids, not muddy on the lows. Just colors my voice perfectly. If you want a sampling of what I have recorded, just visit www.voxmaxaudio.net. 
Thanks,

Includes a -10 db switch as well a bass roll off switch. Also comes with a shock mount, and carrying pouch. Nice.                
Just plug it in to your pre amp and get fantastic sound.                
This is a heavy, beautifully made mic. But then again all of Audio Technica's products are well made. Have not had a single problem with it.                
This is where the AT2035 really shines. For the price you are going to pay for this mic, you swear it sounds like a $500 mic. Tremendous value.                
Have not needed it yet.                 
Looks and sounds great!                
This one is a keeper! Would replace it in a heart beat!                
This is a fantastic microphone for the price range that it is in. The sound quality is very natural, nothing boosted, nothing attenuated. I used this microphone on a 4x12 guitar cabinet and got a very full and warm sound. On vocals, the at-2030 is great. Very clean and warm tone, nothing too pronounced and very easy to EQ and with such a flat response mic, compression works wonderfully on it.                 
The shock mount included is very sturdy and fits the mic well.                 
The microphone was very easy to use: set it up, adjust the pre amp gain and hit record. Thats it. The 80hz low cut is very clean and retains the warmth of the mic. The -10db pad is also very useful on loud sources such as amps.                 
The microphone has a very solid body and everything felt really well built. The shock mount that was included felt equally as sturdy and I never once winced at the thought of keeping the microphone in the shock mount for an extended period of time.                 
Like I said before the price you pay for the microphone does not reflect the quality you receive. For a value mic, there is none better.                 
Didnt need any support from the company.                 
It's not the prettiest mic in the world, but it gets the job done.                 
If I had $3400 to spend on a Neumann U87 there would no question BUT like most people I do not have that kind of budget. For the price this mic beats out many microphones in the $500-$700 range.                 
What can I say that hasn't been said? This thing is incredible! And the fact you can get it cheaper than the 2020 which has a smaller diaphragm is simply amazing. I'll put it this way, I've tried a lot of Chinese sourced mics costing as much as $500. This mic DOES NOT have that brittle high end so many Chinese mics have. It is basically flat all the way across. What goes in is what comes out. It works quite well with my Studio Projects VBT1, but when run through my Saffire Pro 40, it simply sounds amazing! I have two and would gladly by more but I'm waiting for my AT 2050 to arrive.                
A pad and a bass roll-off and the sound for $95 bucks....I can't think of another mic out there for under $400 that even comes close!                
Plug it in, turn it up, and go!                
Built like a tank and certain to last a long time as all AT mics seem to. The two I have are essentially identical in sound at identical pre amp settings...                
There is simply nothing that comes close for anywhere near the money.                
It looks great!                
A long, long time!                
This is a great mic for the price. I use it on acoustic guitar and vocals for recording my swing group. It has a very open and natural sound. I've also used it live to mic violin (great sound) and clarinet (good sound). I did not give it a 10 because there may be something else better out there.                
The only thing I wish it had is a switchable pickup pattern. What do you expect for a mic under $200?                
Sounds great with practically no EQ or processing.                
No problems so far. I've had one for about a year.                
This is the most mic for the money I have seen in a large diaphram mic.                
I haven't used their support.                
It looks nice, but that is not that important.                
I will probably add more mic's to my collection, but I don't foresee retiring this one any time soon.                
After reading a lot positive reviews on this microphone, I decided to buy it since I wanted to put together a small home studio setup in my bedroom, all connected to my laptop.
After having minor issues (all of which were on my end, like forgetting to buy a phantom power piece and an extra XLR cable) I finally got everything set up and was completely blown away by how sweet it sounds.
I meant to give the sound rating a 5, but couldn't change it :( But overall, the sound is absolutely amazing and it definitely is worth it with a small budget! (Spent approx. $200 for the whole setup including the stand)                
This microphone is splendid! My previous microphone got a lot of buzzing and static noise on the background and yet my voice isnt loud enough and it cost $130. but this one has a clear sound with a little low background noise. My voice sounded So clear yet this is just a $140 microphone. The built material is really sturdy and doesnt feel cheap at all. 
the problems that i experience this is the shockmount that isnt really decreasing the vibration from my mic stand. but isnt a big deal and this is Unbelievable for the price!                
The sound quality is great, I would like to buy another set pretty soon...Also, I was amazed by this mic, the first time I used it in my room I could hear my aunt chopping vegetables in the kitchen 2 rooms away...                 
It comes with a shock mount and a protective case and I could not ask for anything else                
I had trouble powering it at first because I didn't know it needed phantom power so I went ahead and bout a simple mixer which works great and after that I never had problems with it. Also this mic works well with my acoustic guitar, it picks up me singing and also the clean sound of my guitar...                
This Mic is Outstanding! Hands Down!                
A great mic at a cheap price... You could not ask for more... Trust me...                
Never had to use it, but I'm sure they are very helpful.                
This thing is a sexy beast... I can't stop using it! It really helped me on my vocals!                
I recommend this mic to everyone who are just starting out... I guarantee that you wont be dissapointed                
This thing is well worth the investment. Very versatile, and all around great mic for the price!                
Good sound for an inexpensive mic. Different than my Rode NT1A mics, but a good different.                
The shock mount works well. The additon of the pad and roll off are great features on a mic in this price range.                
Plug it in and start recording.                
The AT2035 is rugged and well made. I would feel confident using this mic is live settings.                
I paid $95 for this mic. The mic has great sound and is very quiet. Excellent value. A great choice for a home studio.                
This is a great little mic. It is not much of a contender when compared to Neumann U87, bt in the budget mic category you can't go wrong with an AT2035.                
I have had many large diaphram condenser mics, 2020, 4033, Cad, Berhinger, mxl. Our bluegrass band has been using 9 Shure beta 57aʻs, we decided to go back to the One Mic Tradition. The 2035 is great, we use 2020ʻs on the side for instruments but mic a 5 piece band with 3 mics, the 2035 in the middle. We pump out anywhere from 500 to 2,000 watts depending on where we are playing, with proper eq, this thing will do fantastic with 1-4 vocals, picks it up without any extra noise, again learn to eq.                
i cant belive i pay that price for this mic. sound clear, clean and very natural, its amazing, all the people that heard my new recordings with this mic say that sounds awsome                
Audio Technica cares about his costumers, this mic comes with a great Shock mount and a protective pouch. the shock mount its very usefull and it looks great the protective pouch its very good to but i will not keep my mic there.
i want to show everybody what we are talking about couse theres not a loot of pics of the audiotechnica at2035 on internet so this are a few photos that i take

its very simple like everyother mic, i connected to my pream and its ready to record! simply as that                
it looks very solid, the quality of the mic its very good, i feel i can knock out someone with this mic and still working.                
if this mic was for $500 i think it will be a fair price, i mean u cant be wrong whit audio technica, everybody loves at2020 and this is even a better mic                
i never need it but i guess its great                
when i first look this mic i know this is the one i was gonna order. it looks a loot better than other mics.                 
im a satisfied costumer of audio technica, i think its a great company, and this mic its the best!! for the price u cant find anything better meaby the mxl are good to (i dont know) but u cant go wrong with the audio technica i honestly recomend this produc to anyone, from beginners to pro's this is the mic you want, trust me!!                
Awesome Awesome Awesome That's all I can say.                
Oops! Audio-Technica may just have made all their 
other mics under $350 obsolete!
=====================================================================
This mic is like a slightly-juiced AT3035 (which I also own), 
which was already a heck of a mic for the money 
and very underrated.
The sound of the AT2035 is B-I-G, full and crystal-clear. Used with even a cheap preamp, set at proper levels, there is 
no harshness in the highs to my ears, even with no EQ. 
This is not a "German-sound" mic with extra "sheen";It is a simpler, "true-sounding" mic with little coloration and fine presence.
It makes a quality, contrasting addition to a mic collection that already includes those popular & distinctive ADK, or Studio Projects-type "German-flavor" vocal mics.
Compare this to one of AT's somewhat more expensive mics, and the results may surprise you. In my opinion, AT Corp has reason to fear a shootout between this mic and the ones they put out that I won't name
in the $200-350 range. But do your own test if you can, and decide.                
The AT2035 has an effective shockmount. If you prefer to use it upside-down-style, just make sure it is pressed-in firmly.
Somehow, even though the capsule is 24mm (as compared to the 
old AT3035's 26mm capsule), the sound is slightly "bigger" or "fuller".
Just like the AT2020 model has an amazingly big sound for its 16mm capsule, the AT2035 has that characteristic even more.
I suspect similar technology/structure/materials here.
Obviously, some slight technical advance was made (to my ears).                
Soft ballad singers who can sing very close-up to the mic without topping meters can sound gigantic--Like you are right in their throat!
But even farther back, the mic still sounds big (hint: the closer you can sing to a studio mic without distortion, the "bigger" the voice sounds 
in the recording, due to proximity effect.
Just use the AT2035 with a simple preamp, get the levels right (clear W/low-noise), and definitely use a pop-screen if doing vocals.
This mic is best for vocals, various percussion, electric guitar cabs, 
and acoustic guitar close-miking.
I haven't used it with wind instruments so I can't offer anything there.                
Seems solidly-made.
TOP-VALUE ITEM in its price range.
I would even say...WOW.
1 of these and an ADK Vienna, and you are ready to deal with almost any  vocalist, at any time.                
N/A                
IMO, it is the current Tyrannosaus of studio condenser mics under $200.                
I expect lots of years of good use from this mic (for my modest demo/jam-studio), and many happy singers I have yet to meet, but will.                
I bought two Audio Technice AT2020 and AT2021 studio packs to replace Sure SM 57 and SM58's I used in sound reinforcement, but ended up using the Shures for recording sessions on my digital multitrack recorers.
Something was lacking in the sound of my prior recordings and I suspected the SM 57's and 58's as the primary suspects.
I recorded a rock band several weeks prior with the old Shures, and then recorded the same band again using the Audio Technica 2020 and 2021 condencer, phantom powered mikes. 
I could not believe the difference in clarity and frequency response range, from lows to highs.
I used the AT2021's as overheads on the drums to pick up the cymbals, and the larger AT2020's on the Marshall Amp cabs.
The difference between the Audio Technica condencer mikes for recording was far superior than my old mike set up.
I noticed at mixdown with these Audio Technica recording mikes that the flat signal recorded from each instrument needed very little EQ, if any, to sweaten up the mix. 
I liked them so well and they made so much difference on my digital multitrack recorder, that I bought two more Audio Technica Studio packages giving me now 4  AT2020's and 4  AT2021's; that's eight good phantom powered mikes for about $600 bucks, plus shipping.
You can pay thousands to get mikes that rate 10, but you can't get better recording mikes for the money.                
The Audio Technica mikes are well made, feel solid, and work very well for digital multitrack recorders.
A spider shock mount would be nice to come with these.                
No problem using them, just make sure they are connected before you turn on the 48volt phantom power.
You may want a tube preamp for recording vocals into your mixer/recorder,
They work fine without additional preamps on musical instruments.                
The Audio Technica mikes were of top notch quality fit and finish, and worked well in live recording situations.                
I have spent three times the cost of the pair of AT2020/AT2021's and basically wasted money on one mike that did not perform as well as these mikes.
They are the big bang for the home digital studio buck.                
Never dealt with the company before.                
Good looking mike. Musicians commented, "Wow"! and were excited to record with them. Much better sounding recordings were made.                
I expect to be fully satisfied for a long time. These mikes improved my live recordings to professional quality sound, being much better matched to the sonic capability of my digital recorder, than my old Shures were.                
awesome. This mic can handle it all....acoustic, vocals...micing a guitar cab. Its definitely worth buying one.                 
very easy...just plug it in...duh...                
This was made well. Very sturdy. Great sound.                 
yes buy this mic. You will not be unsatisfied. As soon as I got it...I plugged in the two mics and then recorded myself strumming a few chords. Wow. Was I amazed at the sound and quality. Definitely worth buying...I know I said this already...but I want to reiterate this fact...                
no...hopefully I never do...                
I dont really care how it looks...that doesnt do it for me.....its how good it sounds thats important. Although I wouldnt buy a pink microphone so please dont get the wrong idea...hahahahah                
Great sound. Very easy to get a clean, hum-free recording, from both mics.                
Came with nice leather (faux-leather?) cases.                
You plug it in, tweak a few settings on your mixer or what have you, and you're gold.                
Both mics feel very sturdy.                
A huge amount of bang for your buck.                
Haven't used any company support, though I did file for a rebate, and that has been an easy process (so far).                
The large-diaphragm mic is definitely sexy-looking. The smaller one is also pretty sleek.                 
Fantastic product for an incredible price.                
We use 4 other higher end AT studio mics for our choir, which sounds good, but with these two added on, the congregation has praised the sound team for the crisper clarity improvement it's brought to the choir.                
 No low or high switches to mess with
simplicity is a factoid.                
took only a few seconds to set the highs,lows, and mids. NO CRACKING noises.                
Sure I could have spent less money on a similar mic, but you always get what you paid for. I nearly got perfection.                
 Sure those shock mounts are nice but I didnt need them for my application.                
Been using this for acoustic recording at home, just simple singer songwriter stuff and it picks up what I need it to wonderfully.  It's is also versatile for recording use with my Metal band Nephilim Rising.  Great value, great product, I suggest getting one especially if you don't want to or cant drop 1500 buck or more.  Thumbs up guys!                 
This is an excellent mic for the money and is typical of my experience with AT mics. It has a fairly flat, nice full, clean response and does not have the brittle high end of many mics in this price range. Very good sound.                
Set the pattern you want and hit record. If you need to make any adjustments they can be done in production.                
You won't find a better mic without spending a lot more money!                
amazing! loved it easy to use and get a good sound out of, breathes, clear, warm...... For the price its hard to beat.                 
great came with a shock mount, the different patterns makes this baby versitile like crazy! used it on vocals, guitar(cab and acoustic), precussion, overheads and trumpet.                
simple so easy to work with.                
again for the price you paying.....AMAZING!                
value for money...... unbeatable                
havnt had to service it yet.... but to get another shock mount took me one call.                 
one of those cheap mics that "blow" you away.....                 
so surprised....... i got 2 2050 instead of one 4050.... dont get me wrong i would love to own 2 AT4050's but when budget is tight this mic is a complete professional for an entry level price.                
Very Very good condenser mic without spending the huge money(I run it through an Apogee Duet with Logic/KRKVXT6's/BeyerDT250's in my 10'by12'home studio)..absolutley world class!.My music flo is Acoustic/SingerSongwriter-very very nice on acoustic guitar and even better on vocals...on soft intimate vocals very present and detailed/takes a strong more forceful vocal with ease and good detail-the presence/feel this mic produces across a broad dynamic range is very nice...IMHO my gear is pretty good by home studio standards and so I am able to pick up next to anything going on outside of my soundsource/gear and to my pleasant suprise its not too sensitive to outside noise, and barring a passing V8/Train/Plane it actually keeps very good focus to the recorded source pretty tightly...Also actually fine to use without a pop screen(although I do use one occasionally)and it handles plosives/ess'ing pretty damn well....has a nice low self noise(again I have good sensitive gear and can notice otherwise)...equally good when sound source is up on the grill or 6ft back on it....Nice plugged into Genz Benz LT150 Acoustic Amp micing vocals and acoustic...                
Came with a nice shockmount of good quality solid build..,just like the mic,basically its very good to go, nice look black matte finish-looks good...like singing to a beautiful girl-it makes a difference singing into a good looking mic!...hahaha...(you know its true!)                 
Very easy to use, plug into my Apogee duet(has Phantom Power)and its on...have also used into my Genz Benz Shendoah LT150 micing both directly into amp and through vocal TC Helicon Voicetone correct pedal or just micing acoustic guitar, and it sounds very nice especially at lower levels until feedback(only used in small room with bad acoustics-so unsure how it sounds at higher sound level in a better suited environment...I bet its not bad and I am defintley keen to try!haha;)....                
Superb quality-people go on about Chinese condenser blah blah blah....but are you kidding,this is SOLID(accessories included)...This mic is sooo good it has made me an Audio Technica fan for life, I have since purchased an AE5400 handheld condenser which just shines...I am looking into an AT4021 for acoustic guitar studio/live and to be honest-if I had more cash to buy "higher end" gear i.e "the big names"i.e nuemann etc etc I would just go see what Audio Technica has in their top end of mic's....my thinking-if I can get such a great mic's a this price, what can I get from these guys for that quite a bit extra?....a prettty simple no brainer(for me anyway!)..                
I did HEAPS of research...(Listen to "Big Brother"...)and save yourself some time haha!!Best value for money/quality punches well above its weight-FULL STOP.                
Never had problems ,no need to...have you ever heard of anyone needing AT for support....I do ALOT of research before I buy my gear and I have never heard of anyone needing to...tells/told me one thing/pretty exceptional quality gear....                
Like I said before, something feels right about singing into a thing like this!However the most important thing(right?haha..) is the beautiful way this reproduces sound...Who can go wrong(I am fussy and I didnt.....anyway..)                
I will always keep it-its too good, I might look into some higher end AT's somewhere down the line cicumstances($$$)permitting haha...this AT4033 is the bomb, would mind checking out other high end"tube"mic's from them maybe.....if a mic at this price is this good?....ummmmmm                  
Excellent microphone. If I could afford a Neumann I would buy one, compare the two mics and probably not hear much of a difference in clarity. But then, I've been playing in rock bands for thirty years so.....All jokes aside, this is a beautiful mic for the money. I would highly recommend it.                
Almost indestructible.                
Stands up to all my other mics in almost all situations. Great for vocals, acoustic guitars, even pianos and amps. I would call that versitle. I also use it with analogue as well as digital venues with equal quality.                
Outstanding. Comparable to many "famous" mics that cost much, much more. I have recorded with 414s and U87s and the AT33 actally does some things better, especially in home recording situations, and holds its own in all situations.                 
Never needed it.                
Have the original. Am pleased that ater over a decade, a whole lot of people in music have agreed...That is why there is a Special Edition.                
I own the original...still working beautifully after 13 years. Currently, there are a pleathora of inexpensive (cheap?) mics on the market that tempt most of us. However, this one is priced very reasonably, but it gives much more quality than any other mic in the class. Buy it, You have 414s and U67s or U87s? But it. You will use it, and I believe you will adore it!                
THe AT 4033 is a nice mic. Solid build quality with a 10db pad and 80hz roll off. I have only used it for acoustic guitar and vox, and it shines in both applications. Very little eq needed with the roll - off engaged on acoustic. Suits my voice very well. A half db boost around 3k and another shelf @9, and my voice sounds great.                
great sound,although the noise spec. is not as good as my AT4040                
has a 10db attenuator and bass rolloff.It's cardiod only.                
built very nicely-sounds nice on vocals.                
great sound....very clean and bright                
pad, hp filter....its all you need, however a multi directional pattern would have been nice.                
easy                
great quality, i need a better preamp                
you gotta get one of these or two...i have two                
woo, i wanted it, i bought it                
great mic for under 1000                
the cable seems to do the job fine.  i can't attest to the connector quality, but it seems to be pretty good.                  
Awsome product so far sound was crips. Recieved product in two days. I was very happy on how it came and how it was package. Thanks zZounds!                
Too bad audio technica doenst live up to their name with this cable. Xlr tip Broke after just 30 days. But it does sound good.                
Poor quality materials and connections.   2 cables, both failed at the same time, after approx 40 gigs.    Cables were treated well, and not abused.   solder joints at the connectors failed, wire inside is very thin gauge.                
If it fails, it's worthless.                
It's a cable.                
I expected MUCH better from Audio Techica.    I specifically bought it because i didn't want a no-name cable that was going to fail quickly.   I probably would have been better off with a no-name.                
best price I've found throughout all the internet, quick delivery, product worked! I dont know about manufacturer support which the survey insists I rate, since I didnt have to use manufacturer support                
love it. we can not use the mic without the cord                
Excellent cartridge for capturing the sound of vinyl albums. Very clear.                 
I have always enjoyed Audio Technica cartridges and have owned several. After a break-in period of about 12-15 hours this cartridge really opened up. Bass extension improved dramatically and came forward  with authority, transparency is impressive along with slightly warm midrange and smooth, extended highs. A Bargain!  Tom I.                
This headset excels at music or games, sounds good even after 4 hours im sure it will get better. Two cons though mic isnt removable and the extension cable is really cheap. Also you should have a decent amp/dac, but if your looking in this range you probably already have one.                
First off, I bought a pair elsewhere, and the price was more expensive, so zZounds is where it is at. 
Simply put, these headphones are wonderful. Trebles, Mids, and Lows are all clear. Bass has a decent thump, but it stays true to the mix, rather than Beats by Dre's choice of cranking bass up.
The noise cancelling is wonderful. You could go to a football game and hear nothing. Personally, I enjoy fact that I don't need to crank the volume up much. This saves my ears a bit of trouble. 
The battery life is really great on the noise cancelling, two rechargeable batteries = no worries. 
The earpad things are awkward at first, as well as the noise cancelling, but once you get used to them, you will hate going with out it. A learning curve per se.
These  headphones are really good. Bose's line of acoustic headphones are a bit better, but they cost twice as much. These have more "bang for your buck."
If you want exaggerated bass, look at bose or Beats as these may not be for you, though I'd still recommend them even then.                
I havent used my headphones on a plane yet but wiyj my MP3 player they are great. I have changed the MP3's EQ to a flat response ase the headphones give an even great sound across all the frequencies                
They came with leads adaptors all gold contacts, a battery and carrying case so I could use it straight away and travel with them protected                
in normal mode they are great with the noise cancelling mode on the boost is even better                
its early days but the quality looks excellent I suspect they will last a long time                
i have no complaints at all                
cant see me looking to change them as they are idea for all purposes that you need headphones for                
I ordered the Headphones for the office to drown out the typical office chatter.  They worked wonderful.  The music is so good through them also,  just as the reviews write, as good or better than Bose.  I even took them to the range and they were better then any noise canceling headphones I used before.  And ZZounds price can't be beat and their shipping very fast.  I plan on buying some as gifts.  Thank you ZZounds.com                
I bought these to keep my kids from interfering with my online studies.  Since then, I've taken them to work where, with an mp3 player, I cannot hear 20mph winds and misc. noises.  These are great for working outside as long as you don't need to hear things around you.  Whether I listen to Chicago or to the Zutons, the reproduction is excellent.  It takes a bit to get used to the noise cancelling feature as it really gets quiet, kinda like your ears aren't working, lol.  I'll be buying a second pair.                
These come with a great hard case, plenty of plug adapters, and the case has a storage pocket big enough for a spare battery or two.                
Plug it in, turn it on, enjoy!                
These have a solid 'feel' to them.  I don't have to worry that I'm going to easily break them.                
I listened to the first Bose noise cancelling headphones many years ago at an airport demonstration booth.  These are every bit as good, if not better.                
Everybody who sees them, wants to hear them.  And as soon as they hear them, they want a pair.                
I'll keep these until they wear-out, then I'll replace them with a second pair.                
I love the Audio- Technica headphones. They are comfortable, a good price and I'd compare them to Bose! I could tell no discernible difference in the noise canceling or sound quality. To me, The only difference is price! Headphones come with a padded case, adapter cords and battery.                
Wonderful sound.  Noise canceling not quite equal to Bose, but an excellent value for the money.  I could barely hear outside noise on recent airplane flight.  I would recommend these headphones.                
Noise canceling not 100 percent, but perhaps 90.                
Seems well-made, carrying case very nice.                
I have the Bose Noise Comfort headphones. I bought the audio-technica as a cheaper alternative. The noise canceling, the sound, is not as good as with the Bose. However as they are $200 cheaper they are an excellent alternative.                
Damps external sound impressively. The lawn mover is a background murmur. Appreciate the feature of sound passing through with the power off as with passive headphones. Like the connectors and cables which allow various hook ups. As expected with over the ear cupped style my ears get hot. Not too bad for an hour or short on periods.                
Great, Except for the screaming baby next row up and the barking dog from Orlando to LAX. They did as well as could be expected but had to turn volume boost up . I also brought a Vic Firth set of cans that blocked out everything at half the cost. Down side is Bulk and weight. If you can deal with it, Get Them.                
These have good overall frequency response as a pair of listening headphones, but they really shine when the noise canceling feature is turned on. They truly cut outside noise tremendously well, and the music is fuller sounding for it. AT makes many great pairs of headphones and these are a good choice among many.                
i purchased this product to use while flying, it did a great job in muffling the sound of the plane, i use it with my mp3 player and it is nice sound quality cuts out all the noise from other sources.  I really enjoy using my head phones and would recommend them to anyone else.                
no                
very easy,                 
comfortable to wear not too heavy has great sounds                
yes the product is worth what i pay for it.                
no to all                
hopefully for years                
Please note that I am not even anywhere close to being an expert in this field but I really enjoy listening to music of all kinds. here are some of my opinions:
Noise Cancellation is on point. when listening to music or watching a movie, it does cancel out my sound souroundings. 
the 3 settings, are nice . I like the red LED setting which is the midfield fhz. 
the case is duarable and isnt snugged like other cases such as beats by Dre.
Accessories, could of been better, the cables seem a bit flimsy. Audio Technica, could of given another cable. but hey.
I use this especially on the train to work and it does keep outside noise out of my ear. However, people could sometimes hear what Im playing depending  on how high i have my music.
sound quality was slightly more important to me than NC. After all, if they sound bad, there's no amount of NC that can make them sound good!! However, I read an interview with someone high-up at Head-fi (perhaps the founder?), as well as with other reputable reviewers, and they ALL chosen the Bose QC15 over everything else.
The argument? NC headphones are generally used when you're away from home, in environments that are NOT conducive to analytical music appreciation.                
Personally, I hate most in ear headphones now because they are all those gummy earbuds that make your ears feel clogged when you wear them. I've been looking for earphones of a higher quality for a while, and when I came across these I thought I'd give them a chance. I wouldn't recommend them if you have small ears, because they're fairly large, but the sound quality is phenomenal and they are very stylish and comfortable. Now I can listen to my everyday music with nearly the same quality as when I track at my home studio.                 
These in-ears do not live up to the hype. I expected so much more. I would not recommend them.especially for stage.the sound middy,the fit has no seal. The deep lows advertised are not there.the clarity is not there and the earpieces come off the cable way to easy. Sorry not happy                
I bought these for my children who were using/arguing in taking turns on my expensive Grado headphones.  Guess what.  These headphones rock - extremely impressed.  zZounds folks shipped in 2 days and I am buying a pair now for myself to take on road.  The sound quality is seeiously full and dynamic for the price point.  Nice features and sound.                
These headphones have absolutely great sound performance with a wide range of music reproduction. They actually compete with a good quality external speakers. They are comfortable to wear for extended use and store easily in the carry case. These headphones have a better sound quality than those of considerably higher price                
These headphones are the best I've had. The sound reproduction includes widest range of High-Mids & Low-Mids. As most of you know it's hard to find an affordable headset for recording/mixing/listening in the under $100 range. There comfortable to wear for extended use, I'm a drummer. These headphones are not BASS HEAVY. But you can hear and feel the lows & highs too. Being on a tight budget like so many I'm glad I bought these.                 
These headphones are the bessst! They sound flat and accurate.They reproduce sounds very accurately. They sound like my Mackie studio reference monitors. I am very impressed to find headphones of this quality for less than 100 dollars. I am very satisfied with these headphones.                
Straight out of the box, these things might sound a little sharp. Don't get me wrong, clarity is good! But after you bump the volume up on these babies for a week or two, they're broken in like the best pair of shoes you ever tied around your feet. You're able to hear every little hidden beat you weren't able to hear through earbuds or previously owned headphones. I disagree with being "all about that bass, no treble", but if you're listening to music on your iPod/iPhone, do your ears a favor and set your Sound EQ to "Reduced Treble". This should even it all out pretty well. But it goes to show: a little bit of fine-tuning with these will lead to the best music-listening experience you've had. My $320 pair of Beats don't even compare to the M50's.                
No tedious knobs or switches, just a basic aux port which is absolutely ideal for music-listening. Adjustable bands on either side of the headphones makes a comfortable fit inevitable.                
Again, the single aux port grants serious ease of use, even with the multitude of cords and adapters that come wtih the headphones; it's all universal. Works flawlessly with Apple products, Androids phones, PC and Mac... it works with damn-near everything.                
So I'm sitting here, tapping on my Beats by Dre, and they sound like a hallow plastic toy you might buy for your 10 year-old nephew. Now, I'm tapping on my new Audio-Technicas and they sound like a solid piece of oak. They're mostly plastic, but they aren't cheaply made. No seems in the plastic; just a SOLID pair of headphones.                
Why were these not upwards of $300? I mean honestly... if I had listened to these without knowing the price, I would guess them to be around $340+. It's completely backwards (which I have no reason to complain about), equal-quality Beats being around $340 and these standing around a little less than $200. Honestly, the M50's are undervalued for their given quality. I would more than likely pay over $200 for these headphones.                
Just.... WOW. I think I have said it all. BESTHEADPHONESEVER I've never been a fanboy of anything before, but I don't think I can say that anymore.                
Thinking about snagging yourself a pair of Beats, Sol Republics, or Bose headphones? Seriously, THINK AGAIN. These M50's are truly the best headphones you've never heard of.                
Great sound, voice and instrument are very clear (monitor). Bass not too much, enough for my liking. Comfort is top notch for me. Wore it for couple of hours did not hurt my ears at all.                
As a music producer & audiophile I've used different monitor speakers and headphones and listen to music mostly as WAV and AIFF files. But with these headphones I've been able to hear so many new details and be moved by songs in a way I've never experienced before. It's super inspiring. I can hear the vocals so clearly and hear exactly what's happening with echos adlibs and effects. Overtones and differences in the amounts of reverb are very distinct too. The entire tone is beautifully full from high to low end & you can feel the impact and depth of the sub bass while also hearing the all detail of the waveform and the attack and decay and everything. Hearing what's going on with the panning has never been easier either. I checked out FKA Twigs, Drake, Ariana Grande, Travi$ Scott, Famous Dex, Keith Jarrett & Charlie Haden, Baden Powell, Kanye West and much more and it's so cool hearing the articulation and such a range of tones in an instrument and hearing everything so distinctly. These are equally good for acoustic and electronic music. The price is right, the build feels totally sturdy and comfortable, noise cancelling is very effective. I also like that where the audio cable plugs into them it twists to lock so they won't accidentally get pulled out. Basically they're perfect & I couldn't be happier I bought them.                 
I was about to order the Beats Pro and had no doubt they were the best headphones I've had heard until. . . 
After researching online and watching several different reviews from different people, I was convinced to buy the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones. I have to say: I have nothing but great things to say about these headphones; I am so glad and happy I bought these instead of the overpriced Beats Pro. My suggestion to a buyer is to go online and watch the reviews on these headphones before spending so much money on Beats Pro (not that they're bad), but they are really overpriced and many people will agree with me that the sound quality on the ATH-M50x are way superior. I just love them!                
I've been using the sennheiser hd280 pro for the last year+ as part of mixing/mastering set up, & I was very pleased with the performance of the hd280. I need another pair of headphones because of an additional performer that I started working with...I wanted a fantastic pair of cans for less than $200usd. Read a ton of reviews & chose the M50x...wow...wow. Monitoring on the hd280 is like listening to music under water! The M50x is so clear...you can hear everything in your. The seperation is awsome...the base response is amazing...stop reading and just go get a pair already. You'll be happy that you did.                
These headphones are incredible.  I have AKG K77, Sennheiser HD-280 Pro, Phillips noise-cancelling, and various other headphones.  The M50x blow them all away.  Bass like you wouldn't believe and super clear mids and highs.  Also they come with 3 (yes three!!!) different types of cords which are removable.  very comfortable for hours of mixing without fatigue.  I just put together a new digital recording studio and these are now my #1 go-to headphones.                
I've owned quite a few set of 'cans' over the years and have to say that these exceeded my expectations. I've read many positive reviews, so I expected very good performance, but these are much more fun to listen to, and more comfortable, than any closed-back headphones I own. They provide nearly the same level of sound isolation as my Vic Firth Drummer's cans, but with *FAR* superior SQ. The level of detail is greater than my AKG K-240 MK II, but they do give up a tiny bit in the way of comfort to the good 'ol reliable AKG's. I love them both. Now I can use the same 'phones for full-volume drum practicce as I do for critical listening for pleasure. Great price and service from my favorite music store, zZounds, and as always the 4 payment option makes them easy to own. Thanks for another great experience!                
These headphones are a major upgrade to my previous Sony headphones. They are very articulate and actually sound balanced in all frequencies!                
Loving the ATH-M50x Headphones. very comfortable and great frequency response range.                
My first product review, I highly recommend these for any type of music listening on your laptop, iPhone, Andriod, etc. They truly are great. For my first pair of real quality headphones, I hit the jackpot!                
These headphones exceeded my expectations! I have a pair of Bose AE-2's that I use as my primary pair of headphones. (Always thought the sound quality was "OK") These new ATH-M50mx phones blow the Bose out of the water!!! Nice, tight Bass, open Mids and sparkling highs! Perfection! The Bose have been donated to my Grandson! Lol!                
I am a professional drummer/percussionist and a not so professional studio rat so I have tested many, many different headphones and IEM's. I personally own probably a dozen different brands/models but my go to phones were the Sennheiser Pro 280's For everyrhing Studio and practice but for live events I preferred the Audio-Technica ATH-M50X for a slightly fuller meatier low end. 
That is until I traded three Ben Franklins here at zZounds for a pair of these M70X phones. Knowing what I know now I would gladly have given 4 possibly 5 Franklins for a pair of these cans but they are easily worth the going rate of $299 so if your on the fence at all about spending the cake for these no worries my friends you will be pleased with the investment. Now I reach for the M70's in every studio session, rehearsal and especially enjoy these in live events! I can royally beat on my skins with my largest pair of sticks and what I can hear is much less than with any other brand/model and I can wear them for hours and hours and never get tired of wearing them, really! But best of all of course is they're ability to reproduce the music cleanly the way it was meant to be heard. Even at high volumes these cans are clean and efficient. I could go on and on about the case, the detachable cables, the padded headband and yes the sound! But I wont because I'm tired of typing and your tired of reading so part with the Ben Franklins and purchase a pair of these today. You'll be glad you did and the only issue you will have is trying to decide what to do with your current set of cans!                 
I bought these headphones for mixing as well as casual listening and they are the best headphones I've owned. I prefer the balanced, accurate sound from these over any other headphones. I always heard about having to burn them in to get the best sound, but they honestly sounded great straight out of the box (I'm sure they'll sound even better down the road).                
I bought these mainly for my production and being able to mix without the use of monitors. First time using them they were amazing very detailed and flat just like i needed them. I have some trouble with the high end but thats just me learning the headphones. I think these are great and def. recommend them!                
better than I expected. exactly what i was looking for in a studio headphone. smooth mids and highs and plenty of bass. the detachable cable is a plus and the carrying case is great too. very pleased!                
It might seem a lot of money, yet these ATH-MSR7 are well worth it. I tried the Audio Technica ATH-M50x and the ATH-M70x models, they are good, this one is much smoother and an elegant design. They are quite cushy and a little tighter on the head than some. I mix and record tracks using these often and find these a very high fidelity tool.                
I call these headphones, "The Truth"! They are very precise and detailed! These are the best headphones I've ever owned for critical listening! Very Nice!                
These are the lowest priced, high-resolution headphones I have found in the $180-$200 price range.  Many other headphones CLAIM to be high-resolution, but these ATH-MSR7 are the only ones I found that truly are. These can are very comfortable for long periods of time and the sound is balanced. If you have the extra money these headphones won't disappoint. 
These headphones have great frequency response, even in the low end. I was kind of suspect about them being openback at first but they are shockingly quiet in that regard. If you mix like I do and want some great headphones to use when switching between them and your studio monitors for cross reference these are a perfect fit for the price! They are everything I thought they would be!!                
These headphones are a great value for the price! I am currently using them on an electronic drum set and the sound is amazing. Great treble and bass!                
I've seen and read some mixed reviews of these headphones but in my opionion they're very good overall. As far as features they have a kind of light noise cancelation and a hear through mode which I tried and is really cool, it lowers the volume somewhat and uses the mic to boost sounds in the room. It's kind of the opposite of noise cancellation I guess but it's an interesting idea and I'll be curious to see if it ends up being useful.Built quality is excellent with lots of metal and really nice padding everywhere, They're super comfortable for long periods of time.Sound is good and very detailed, it's definitely a colored sound so maybe not for everyone but they're super fun.Value is ok, they're a little expensive, I could see them being a good value at the $200 range but at $250 they're just ok. I got them on a warehouse reseal deal and they arrived in perfect condition so they were a bit better value for me personally.I'm super happy with these headphones, everything is really good. Sound, quality, battery life and features all stand out to me. Give them a try especially if you can score a good deal on them.                
I've had this table for about 3 months now and have been playing in the club with it. So far it is the best turntable I've played on. Every week I have to pack up and move my stuff from my studio to the club and everywhere else I am going to play, so it has been very durable in that aspect. It also looks great! When I'm playing in the club, people always walk up to make requests and I catch them looking at them. One guy in particular always comments on how cool it looks. So it's got a good "wow Factor" The motor on this thing is unstoppable. I pressed down on my record to see how much pressure it can handle, and I had to chicken out because I was putting a lot of pressure and it still would not stop. I had Numarks before and they would stop if you put too much on the platter. Features are great to play with. The start and stop break times are fun to experiment with to see what effects you can make with it. The S-arm is great. If you get it all set up right it wont skip at all. I had straight arms on my Numarks and they didn't feel this sturdy. Long story short; Super OEM all the way, and these are the ones to get!                 
This Transaction was fast,easy and satisfying.I had not seen this turntable in person but I knew the Audio Tecnica line of products and had sold and owned their products. I have a large record collection and my present table was OK but I liked all of the features of the Audio Technica ,especially the USB and ability to archive digitally,The fact that has a heavy duty motor and great controls ,Quartz lock,range of pitch control, 33,45 and &78 speeds,(I own 78s as well) A great table for battle or easy use. The table is easily set up .I have several cartridges and headshells and all are compatible with the tonearm.The reviews looked good so I chose to take advantage of the 8 payment plan.The table arrived in good condition in 2 days.I have been happy ever since.Buy it you won't be dissatisfied.                
I bought 2 of the AT-lp1240's in the hopes it would satisfy my need for a replacement DJ turntable and I have to say that they do not disappoint. The motor itself should be a selling point due to its high torque alone, but that's not the only great thing about this TT. The switchable phono/line output is a saving grace for those who are using a purely analog mixer or a mixer with an audio interface built inside. The dual start/stop buttons are very convenient for those who like to DJ with the decks in "Battle Style" (or vertical oriented) setup. My favorite feature has to be USB connector so that you can record any vinyl and convert them to a digital music format (MP3, AIFF, FLAC, etc.). Honestly, it's hard to find any fault with this turntable.
All in all, this is a turntable that's definitely worth its price.                
I have been a DJ since 1986 I got my first real pair of tables the following year, which was a used pair of Technics 1200MkII. Mine were the European version because they had adapters on the power supply ends for American use! Now I never thought in a million years that a new turntable could steal my heart away until I purchased a new pair of AT-LP 1240'S These tables make those others loom mediocre! That's a bold statement! But try them yourself and you too will be convinced! I love my new tables!                 
bought one to hold me over while onebof my technics is being repaired. quickly discovered that i prefer the atlp1240 over the 1200. It's a very strong contender in the world of post technics - super oems and highly underrated. strongly recommend for anyone on the fence about buying used technics(which WILL eventually need servicing) and the newer ridiculously overpriced pioneer iterations. 
I plan on buying another                 
I purchased this to replace a turntable for my vintage system that I purchased in the 70's.   Although it is a manual turntable instead of the semi-automatic it replaced, I couldn't be happier.  It took me about two hours to set (I'm a perfectionist), but most people could do it in about 15-20 minutes.  But the extra time was worth it.  I couldn't be happier.  The speed is correct, the tracking is perfect, the anti-skate is dead on, and it is heavy.  Absolutely no skipping or feed back through the tone arm. And the sound is amazing.  I am using a spare AT 95 cartridge, which is a mediocre, but good, beginners cartridge.  Can't wait to hear what it sounds like with a really good AT or Ortofon cartridge.  It will probably blow me away.    I know this is primarily a DJ turntable, but for home use and for audiophiles like me it is perfect.  I highly recommend it.                 
The quality and build of this turntable is on par with the Technic 1200, but more modernized and additional torque. I purchased this with the Pioneer S9 mixer and I'm in heaven.                
Had to try this deck. I've tried all makes and models of every sort of turntable for scratching and mixing and I have to say this deck impressed me with its accuracy and its performance. The pitch is lock solid on any pitch %. The looks is as good as its durability and features. I am impressed. 
To all you scratch djs.... This turntable is a must for you bedroom DJ's.                 
I was going to get 1200s but they are pricey if you buy reconditioned and ready to go and to buy used from private seller you don’t know what you’re going to get and parts are expensive on 1200s. So I decided that instead of spending $450 on 30  year old 1200s I could go brand new current technolgy and I did. I have absolutely no regrets about my purchase. The torque is way more powerful than a 1200. It comes with a dust cover and headshell too.  I recently mIxed with vinyl and that too sounds clean !! You can buy other super oems but this one here is the one to go for. You will have no regrets                 
I have been a spinning wax since 1991 I got my first real pair of tables in 2000, which was a great used pair of Technics 1200's later got 2 more Then owned a New 1210. Now I never thought in a million years that a new turntable could steal my heart away until I purchased a new pair of AT-LP 1240'S. That's a bold statement! But try them yourself and you too will be convinced! I love my new tables!                
For the money you can't beat these super OEM turntables. Very nice, well built and solid as a tank. Plus they come with  dust covers already. You can pay twice the price for a pair of old 1200s or even some new PLX-1000s if you want but these are the same exact thing as the Stanton St 150, Reloop 7000s and Plx - 1000 for less money. I love my 1200s but it's time to move on and these are my new favorite turntables. Did I mention it had a very strong motor? zZounds makes it happen with their pay as you pay plan... Thank you zZounds!!                 
It produces a double tap "cogging" sound when the motor is initially engaged. After which, it becomes quieter than many new, more expensive, belt-drive tables. I like direct drive tables, and I know they can sometimes be noisy, so I've gotten my ear right down to the platter on this one, and it's vert quiet, indeed!
The included cartridge is better than those included on tables that cost double the price. However, all initial carts are intended to be upgraded.                
It has no VTA or azimuth adjustment, as far as I know. A thicker/thinner mat can always fix VTA, and tables that cost $1000 don't usually have azimuth. Lack of features is honestly a plus in a home table vs one for DJ use. I wish it didn't even have the pre-amp, but at least it can be switched off. Features like auto-return and such can break, and also add unwanted noise. The anti-skating is great, which definitely matters. The tonearm lever lowers it very slowly. That's also awesome!
It does what it needs to do, not much more. Plays 33's and 45's. Yes, it has USB, which I also wish it didn't have, because RCA recording is just as easy.                
If your headshell comes aligned (mine was), then it's as easy as it gets! They include an alignment protractor so you can be sure. Other than that, it's plug and play!                
Amazing for the price! I imagine it will last a lifetime! Yes, there are better tonearms, better platters, better isolation feet... you can spend $10,000 on a table, and you still wont have "the best". They say you get what you pay for. I feel with this table, you get a little more than that.                
Best new, budget, direct drive table on the market for home use. Period. End of discussion. Spend 4X more, and get a Technics SL-1200G or get this one.                
I've never needed to contact Audio-Technica.                
It does kind of look like a black and silver bad-ass... yeah!                
It appears that AT didn't bother to carefully spec this table. They knew it was better than X, so they just slapped X on the package. This seems very much to their detriment, as independent reviews show it surpasses the specs in almost every way. More on this in the details.                
Although direct drive, it doesn't have the features typical of a modern DJ table. What it has, however, are specs far better than listed, making it a great table for home listening.                
Just like all the ratings say this is the best turntable money can buy unless you feel like spending over $300. This is my second turntable, but first of this brand and I was amazed by how great the sound quality is. The arm is automatic, which is a feature I really enjoy. There is some minor setup required (attaching the belt & slip mat), which is super simple and if you can't figure it out Audio Technica has how to videos on youtube. If you are thinking about buying a turntable I would definitely consider the LP-60. It also shipped fast in very durable packaging.                 
I bought this turntable to replace my Audio Technica AT-LP50, bought 3 years ago which I put back as a spare. The "60" sounds identical....which is pristine(as in 20-20K flat frequency response, no rumble or other noise)! You can spend $500 on a turntable and not hear any better results! The "60" has a clear plastic dust cover which I like better than the tinted cover of the "50". My only complaint: the 60 has a cheap porous(as in holes in it) platter mat where the 50 has a solid rubber mat. The older solid rubber mat will not allow debris to fall into the table's mechanism. The AT-LP60's mat will. Borrow another platter mat. Other than that, this is a fine turntable for digitalizing your LP collection. I reccomend it for ANYONE who wants to explore vinyl. The controls/mechanism are the same as the previous "50" model and work great. A fine product and actually looks cooler than the 50. If you buy one, go ahead and order a replacement stylus with it and store it. I stick with what I know works, and AT turntables work, even if you spend less than $100. These turntables may track at around 3-4 grams compared to the vintage tables at 0.75(or less) grams, but IMO that is better for today's aging records and not harmful in any way.                
It comes with all needed cables to connect to PC line in or any other line level or phono level input. And a 45rpm record adapter.                 
This is a very user friendly product and can be set up in minutes. The sound is pristine. The manual is very clear.                
I have no worries that it will last for at least 3-5 years. My only complaint is the cheap platter mat, a minor issue and can be replaced.                 
This is the bar-none best turntable on the market for the money. The quality to price ratio on this is extremely high.                 
Never had to deal with them. No issues.                
It is a very sexy turntable. The turntables of old looked totally masculine with controls(antiskating, etc) to clutter them up. This is a marvel of simplicity to appeal to Lady Gaga or Miley Cyrus.                
If I replace this product, it will be with the same item, or it's "next generation" AT turntable. I have decided to stick with this manufacturer forever.                
I've hooked my turntable up to my Fast Track Pro; with the right adjustments it comes out crystal clear, records perfectly with no feedback, clicks, or pops.                  
The ability to switch from phono to line is nice.  The turntable doesn't have anything that'll "WOW" you as far as features go, but it gets the job done and is simple to use.                
As I just said, it's easy to use.  Setup was a cinch.  Five steps to set it up and you're ready to rock.                  
I mean, you get what you pay for.  I was shopping for a beginner's turntable and it seems to fit the bill.  Audio Technica makes some great stuff for reasonable prices, and this turntable is no different.  I probably wouldn't "take it on the road" with me, but I think as a household turntable, I bet anybody who is good at taking care of their equipment can get several years of good use out of it.                  
It's a basic turntable with great sound quality; unless you want something to scratch with, which will probably run you AT LEAST twice as much (especially DD tables), this is as good as an entry level table gets.                
I haven't had any problems yet, and I hope I don't have to.  I will say that when I've had tech problems with my Audio Technica gear before, their support was easy to reach and friendly.                  
Not very sexy, but a good get for a beginner.                  
I hope to get solid use from this turntable for 1-2 years (at least a year).                
Product could have used a little longer cable for hookup to receiver, especially since onend is attached to unit.                
Since buying this I have realized what I've been missing out on. Vinyls have become a preferred method for listening to music because it has a more personal connection. The only downside of this product is having to buy speakers separately, but you'll be happy you went with this product. I love that the arm automatically places itself onto the record simply by pressing "Start." This is VERY user friendly and I plan on buying it again for my secondary apartment!                
This turntable works out fairly well given it costs relatively the same as turntables that perform much more poorly. I am convinced that it sounds just the same as the more expensive atlp120. I have this hooked up to a Behringer minigraphic eq and it sounds pretty good through my mid-grade sony sound bar with subwoofer. Its not a perfect audiophile setup, but it has a lot of value for entry level enthusiasts. I am convinced you won't get a better experience without spending at least $500.                 
This is a great turntable.....the sound is awesome!                  
After much shopping around and comparing many different starter turntables, I chose the Audio Technica AT-LP60 Turntable. The price was right and it has performed fabulously, including playing some old and not well cared for LPs. It is simple to operate and I like that it has it's own amp built in so that you can hook it up to self-powered speakers when a stereo system is not available. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.                
Was very pleased with the quickness of the delivery. It was well packed and was very easy to assemble.it was very easy to hook it up to my old stereo. The sound was overwhelming. I enjoy listening to all my old records. They even sound very good with the new turn table. I would give it a five star rating overall.Eliminate the incorrect stars.                
Decent for reasonable play. There is rumble if you walk into the room if the floor is sensitive to stepping around where you place it. Good value for the money. Ready to go with cartridge, preamp, and necessary cords.                
Good sound IF you don't have a sub, then it will feed back through if you are not careful.  I had to move up to a heavier table.  For bookshelf speakers it would be fine.                
Lots of nice features for entry level, auto start and stop, but no tracking or anything                
Very easy to use                
Its kinda on the cheap plastic side, but what do you expect for this price point?  Its a great deal.                
This thing is priced great, no arguing that                
Didn't need AT support, but Zzounds was great                
Not real sexy, but what do you want for this price?                
I had to return it and upgrade, couldn't handle my speakers                
I had an issue with my prior AT LP60 that I had ordered in which it simply didn't work. I called and spoke to several employees who were very kind, and timely in their replacement with a working unit. I hate to say that I had my doubts when reading about Zzounds,  but this was a solid first experience.                
I was really excited for my first turntable to come in the mail but to my disappointment it came broken. I thought it was me not knowing what to do but the gentleman who picked up the phone said it was the turntable. I hope i get a working one when i return this                
Like any audio device, the sound is only as good as the weakest link. Since I only use this product through my computer, well, there is the weakest link. It performs as I expected, and with the free Audacity software download, I can convert my vinyl to digital format. The discs sound great in my stereo, so I rate the device as very good.                
No problems setting it up. Just plug into line in and play.                
It was certainly worth it to me. It does everything I wanted it to do.                
No issues, no contact with the manufacturer.                
Basic practical unit.                
I expect this will be the last turntable I ever buy.                
Great turntable.  It was easy to hook up and sounds great.  For the price this is a perfect option for someone who just wants to play some records.                
super basic.  no frills.                
so easy to use!                
It seems good enough, especially for the price.                
For the price this turntable has some very nice features. My 18 daughter is really into vinyls just like her dad was in the day. The alumina platter auto/start and versatility in speaker option are wonderful. I couldn't afford a full system so it's nice she can simply connect her Bose computer speakers directly to the turntable because it has a preamp. She has a MacBook and will use it to make MP3s. We love the looks too                
Ordered as a gift for my wife and she loved it! Since it already has a built in pre-amp, I was able to buy some inexpensive, powered, studio monitor speakers that plugged into the RCA cables on the back of the turntable into the speaker's AUX input. Wires were included with the turntable, so I didn't have to buy any extra. Just speakers and turntable and it sounds way better than any combined speaker/turntable units like Crosley. It looks nice. It's easy to use. So glad I got this set up!                
I just recently got into vinyl about 4 months ago so this turntable is perfect for me. A friend of mine gave me his old one which is basically an older version of this minus the USB capabilities but it was really finicky and frustrating.  This one that I bought is fantastic. It works perfectly every time and is extremely easy to assemble and use. The sound is great and I am overall very pleased. I am sure other turntables produce a better sound and are overall higher quality and I will eventually get to them down the road, but for now this one is perfect. The only downside really is not having a 10" setting.                
I can't recommend this.  Via the USB connection, it is clearly an overdriven signal, distorts pretty badly, whether recording or just listening.  
The hardware, while pretty well thought out, has a cheap feel.
I'll do more research to try to figure out how to make it work, but if you're looking for "plug and play", at least with my Windows 7 machine, this ain't it.                
Did come with cords and adapters; pretty well appointed in that regard.                
See above.                
If it doesn't work as advertised, what value is there?                
Don't know about support, can't get them.                
I may be sending this back.  Very disappointed.                
THE TABLE IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE AND A WORKING MAN I HAVE A LOT OF RECORD AND BEEN PUTTING OFF GETTING A NEW TURNTABLE WITH USB AND I ALSO LOOKED FOR ONE THAT ALSO HAD RCA SO I CAN HOOK IT TO MY HI FI IF I WISH, BUT AFTER USE THIS CO. I MAY JUST IN THE FURTURE BUY AN OTHER ONE SO WOULD'NT HAVE TO CHANGE THEM OUT GOOD BUY GOOD CO.                
Not as smooth or refined as my old magnetic cartridges, but OK.  Unfortunately, the cartridge cannot be taken off, so that I could not mount one of my old (better) cartridge.  It will do.                
The software for digitizing records (Audacity)is very sophisticated, but the instructions are very poorly organized and almost too complicated for a regular, non-nerd person like me.
The "Off" button on the turntable does not work, I have to lift the tonearm off manually to stop a running record.                
Software instructions too complicated, poorly written, very hard to follow for the average user.
The handle on the sound cartridge (to lift off the tonearm) is small and at an awkward angle. It is almost impossible to lift off the tonearm without dropping it.                
This a great microphone at any price.  Very flat response.  Maybe a bit of extra shine around 12khz, but nice and flat.  Very quiet.  Works well for anything.  I use 2 of them in stereo for Classical Guitar.   I have a great mic preamp, and great converters which i believe is a must with any mic.  Dont expect anything great from any mic unless you have your entire signal path really together.                
The side address is cool, cause the cable hangs straight down, so there is no wear on the end of the cable.   Its small, and light.                
easy to use.                
i baby my equipment, so i cant comment on ruggedness.  But it has worked with no problems so far.                
you wont find a better small condensor for this price.                
Have'nt needed any support.                
I cant live without these mics                
The first time I heard the amp I was impressed with the difference. While not as forward, it was wide, open, and clear. An acceptable trade off. Highs were crisper, almost hyped but not annoying. We'll say sharper. The bass was clear and accurate as well although lessened, much like I would expect from a monitor and I can live with that. I've enjoyed this amp on both the 215's at work, being much clearer on dialog and around the house or running errands with the HD598s for the sound stage. I signed up for Tidal just to really test this thing and while I can't say anything definitive about using Tidal's "HiFi" files there is something there that makes the experience more enjoyable, something subconcious perhaps. It's not the night and day difference of fringe distrotion we hear in 128kb/s music versus 320kb/s mp3's, but from 320 to 16/44.1 it's...more engaging, I'm more aware of the music. More believable, maybe fuller sounding? The difference is enough I would prefer the files from Tidal or similiar services, but not enough I would buy everything again just for the maybe 20% increase in quality-ish-ness.The original idea to even buy something like this came from the SkullCandy Methods inability to handle my mix files I was printing for reference. Once copied to my phone the Note 8 would silently compress and downsample them to compatability but playing from the laptop I record and mix on would not work. With the AT and 215s worked like a charm, and with the sonic characteristics I was able to reference as needed and study the mix elements, so another point for the PHA there. I tried different mixes in 16 and 24 bit, flac and wav, all worked like a charm and this lends to the amp being clean in it's reproduction as my mixes were darker and muddier (still learning) compared to my music library. In the car I have the stock radio and speakers but have added a JL Audio 10W7 in a sealed box powered by a JL XD 700/5 to round out the sound. Until I finish replacing the speakers and rewiring them to be powered by the amp I have no Aux In, so I use an FM transmitter, which most of us know is not great but better than nothing. The FM transmitter introduces static and is subject to interference, and worst of all has a low output meaning I have to turn the radio up more than I'd like to get decent volume but with a high very noticable noise floor during pauses or quiet parts. Enter the AT 55BT, using this as a preamp with my phone in a clamped windsheild mount the noise floor is significantly defeated and signal is improved greatly as well as quality. The most noticable difference here is the bass is stronger unlike in my headphones which I thought was strange. No distortion at all at full tilt from the phone and AT amp, making a much more enjoyable experience in the car as well. So from my trials, I find this unit to be good at what it does for it's intended purpose; a high quality bluetooth preamp. It's usefullness has me loving it and using it more and more, but I still have doubts.                
The unit is surprisingly small. Think Bic lighter, this thing is 1.5x the height and width, as thin or thinner. Light as a feather, perfect for the coin pocket on your jeans or even a shirt pocket. This lends to feel of it being well made, if you drop it it's too light to make a real impact, doesn't seem to flex, and the included clip protects the switches and buttons.The face is machined with an almost holographic Audio Technica logo which is for lack of better words, sexy. It's a very pretty device, nice to hold in your hand, the buttons are familiar the 3 lights on the front dance during operation and functions. It reminds me of Sony devices, how they have sounds and visual cues to add to the experience of the device. Very Japanese!I first used this as a normal Bluetooth device, paired it, plugged in and spent some time with it. I will say plainly that it will not push high end headphones, know this now. With the amp mode switch (mode A/B or gain Hi/Lo) there really wasn't a significant difference, only a slight boost in volume meaning that for the HD598s I had to turn my phone up into the orange (above 60-75%) which I normally would anyway but the fact I had to, to even start getting loud with the Hi gain option was disappointing but not a deal breaker. It definitely gets loud enough to enjoy and drown out ambiance but headphones that are 50 ohm or higher may not benefit from this amp. Conversely its excellent with IEMs. Probably my favorite use for it with the true 7 or 8 hour battery life I use it at work in a fabrication shop where it's very loud and the Shure's offer superior hearing protection over typical earbuds.Now I've been using it in LDAC mode which it confirms with a green light on the front. On the Note 8 when you pair them together there is a slider in the menu where you would forget the device for LDAC, you have to enable it. I also turned on developer options and forced AptX 16 and 24 bit, 44.1 and 48k to little or no imporvement over SBC. Probably because of the files themselves. But with LDAC enabled the phone transmits 32bit 96k by default, basically the difference between fiber and standard cable for internet. The headroom is there if you need it and can benefit you even if you don't. The problem I've encountered here is packet loss or audio/signal dropout. Intermittantly anyway, no disconnects. I have had this problem where if I kneel or squat down the bluetooth would become erratic with popping and CD like skipping, not very often but it happens. This amp seems to be prone to that. At first it seemed like the phone itself was having trouble processing the audio at that high of a level and do everything else it needs to causing artifacts but I've had it happen when handling the amp and even my headphones, coincidence maybe but it's happened often in a short period of time. It bothers the crap out of me but not enough I want to send it back because it doesn so well in so many places. Just something to be aware of. When I receive the device everything looked in order except that there was a small plastic film/bag in the bottom of the box making me think it had already been returned and maybe it's just this unit is iffy. Hard to say.While I'm sure using LDAC reduces battery life I'm not aware and the amp uses a normal micro usb and probably does best with .5-1 amp blocks so charging is easy. I would recommend that the batter be excersised for this type of device if you want it to last and you should at $120. Drain it completely and charge it completely to excercise the cells as often as possible. The included clip seems strong and fits snug while still being easy to remove and leaving controls easy to access. The buttons are plastic with raised labels in a typical layout and function to most bluetooth headphones letting you control volume, skip, play/pause, and answer hang up calls. Obviously I can't hear the microphone but being Audio Techinica we can assume it's a better than average condenser with a good pick up range you don't have to hold near your face to be heard, and again, I work in a loud shop and have been able to clip it to my shrit collar and keep working while talking on the phone. The signal range is decent enough but not impressive, expect 30 to 50 feet before it starts to break up and even sooner if there's a wall between you and the transmitter. Not really a deal breaker considering it's purpose.                
Plug and Play. One option switch and audio controls, pairs quickly by it's model name, and produces great audio!                
I don't see this thing breaking unless subjected to extreme stress like being run over. It's so light and small it's tough without trying. While the main body and clip are plastic I don't have any fear of damge but the machined aluminum face would be a shame to scratch. The headphone jack holds onto the plug well without being grabby, no issues while moving around or handling the device even with a big 1/4 to 1/8 adapter sticking out of the top! Although with the clip attatched the adapter is just shy of sitting down all the way. This doesn't affect the signal but means it's not properly seated and more prone to being pulled out but no issues so far.                
This where I stay on the fence. With all the options on Amazon as the Audiophile market grows it was a tough call. I went with this unit because Audio Technica is popular for a reason, their products are loved, tried, and true. There's rarely a perfect, one for all solution with things like this but the PHA55BT checks a lot of boxes which keeps me from getting too upset about it's hiccups. Like most things you can definitely go cheaper at the cost of quality and functionality, and you can spend more for materials and small improvements. As with most of my purchases I find this to be middle of the road, the sweet spot. A brand with a solid reputation for quality and performance making a well equipped and very convenient device, I took a chance on this unit and the more I use it the more I value/appreciate it. I definitely don't want to downgrade but would not spend a penny more for something like this. So I apologize for the length but I know studio and producer types will look at this as well as "audiophiles" who don't know the jargin or specs, but this unit can be great for anyone and it's not cheap so this is my best effort to inform because I searched forums and aritcles to find little or nothing which is surprising considering the brand and level of interest in this market these days. I'm not an audiophile, I'm a home stuido operator and live sound guy on some weekends but I love music and want to hear it on the level (bada pssh).If you can afford it BUY IT. If you're just interested in a solild, high value BT receiver for you >$150 headphones, this could be great but it's not necessary. You decide. I took a chance because I'm a brand loyalist. I'd like to buy the PHA100 DAC but again, the price. That's Apogee and Universal Audio territory. But maybe, just maybe, Audio Technica has something to prove in this growing market.                
None to speak of yet.                
Wow I actually bought this, no going back now lol now if only I could find some real world info on the PHA100 DAC, I could have the matched pair and that would be WOW. You know, because a e s t h e t i c.Seriously, I would buy this again.                
Please don't hate me kind zZounds employee! I felt a divine purpose in this one.This is my first purchase of a "Hi-Res" audio device, aside from studio equipment. I wasn't able to find any reviews or real world info on this device but it seemed to fit the bill of what I wanted and with the Audio Technica name I felt it would be better than most. After a week of use with Shure 215s and Sennheiser HD598s as well as in the car and through my desk monitors I'm on the fence with this one, but again, first device of this type so maybe it's my expectations that are making it difficult. For reference I am using my Note 8, Google Play, Tidal, and LDAC as the source which may not be the best but this is my experience with the PHA55BT. My daily listening at work is with SkullCandy Method Wireless, so the lack of hype here may be causing me to be unsure. You be the judge.                
I have owned many Audio Technica products over the years. I currently own 3 pairs of studio headphones, a condenser microphone, and now the LP120. I have yet to have a bad experience with this brand. I have been in the market for an affordable direct drive turntable for some time now. After reading many reviews and hearing about zzounds easy payment plan, I decided that now was the time to purchase. When the turntable arrived, I felt the excitement of a little boy waking up on christmas morning. I was able to set up and have the turntable ready for use in my daw within 30 minutes of it being dropped off at my door. It is heavy, well made, and extremely easy to use. The motor is fairly strong as well if you plan on using it for scratching. The only problem with this turntable is the platter. It is slightly warped as I have read in reviews before. This does NOT affect its playability whatsoever. If you are in the market for a DD turntable on a budget, I cannot see how you could go wrong with the LP120                
I have been waiting and looking for the right T.T., well I finely found it here at zZounds, What I have found else where was around the same price point, But! zZounds offered much more bang for your buck, being like me, I'm on Disability and I have to watch what I spend, with zZounds there were no Tax ! and WOW!!! FREE 2 Day Shipping!. I don't know about you but being able to order off line from your chair makes a great deal to me, Right to your front door in 2 Days! The package was double boxed and nicely, no damage at all, I had order from somewhere else before and it came damaged, Bummer right? Not for me any more I know my first stop from now on, zZounds. I love the T.T. I purchased a cork platter mat and I am ready to go. They saved me money and that's a plus to me when a Company can do that.The Audio-Technica works great, no warped platter as I have read from others, sound from right and left is fine, lots of extras on this Table I like, like the pop-up cue light, it is very nice where I have my table in a cabinet that needs light, I have to say I'm impressed with the cartridge and stylus included with T.T. Changed it around with my Stanton 600 cartridge with a 600EE stylus and I couldn't hear a different, so they did good I think. Anyway, great T.T., pricing , Free 2 Day shipping, zZounds has my future business for sure!                
i couldn't wait to recieve this turntable and when it arrived and i unpacked it i just stared at it, and before i play an album i still look at the turntable it's just great to finally have one so advanced compared to the one i had, purchase one you will not go wrong.......  
These turntables are well worth the money. I have a pair of these and love them. I use technics from time to time and these perform just as well. The torque is great for scratching. I don't use the preamp as I use it with serato and timecodes. I haven't had any issue. I did upgrade slipmats as well as the cartridges to shure 44-7s. The sound quality is just as good as the technics.   I would recommend these to anyone!!!                
I received the product quick works great get to play old records .One thing It does not have is auto return arm so when the record is over you have to get up shut it down                
Excellent product; the best you can get at this price. I highly recommend this items those who love to play vinyl records.                
I was amazed when I read about pay for play...thought there had to be a catch..so I purchased this turntable..only $68 down...I received it about a week later...shipping was quick and product was flawless..I'm in love with my records again because of zZounds GREAT service and the it pay for play service..I highly recommend this company and this turntable..Thank you again                
Very good                
The stop start is awesome, very fast and precise. Also the tone arm lever that slowly drops onto the records. Least useful option is the reverse option. Who wants to play records backwards? Paul isn't dead.                
Very easy to plug into other components                
Very sturdy for plastic. I hope it last 10 years.                
This is an excellent turntable for the price. I would give it 5 stars if it was Made In USA. It is Made In China and China has no quality control. It also comes with a DC motor and an American Made AC motor would make this THE top turntable. A DC motor doesn't last as long as an AC motor (turntables from yesteryear have AC motors and most of them last 30+ years. So with the cons out of the way, on to the pros. For a plastic TT this thing is a tank. I had no problems setting it up. The tone arm counterweight took a while to get just right but it just takes some patience. This model comes with the AT95E stylus which tracks at 2 grams. The previous stylus no longer comes with the LP120. Trust me, this one is better (it is the GREEN cartridge). Others have also complained about a pre-amp hum. I detected no hum on mine. I also have my own pre-amp but have been using the one built in to the TT. If it becomes an issue later I will simply use my other one. The slip mat is felt. This worried me at first because everyone wanted the rubber mat that comes with the Technics-1200. Well I have to say the felt mat isn't so bad. I don't see what the big deal is but I am not a club DJ and did not buy this for club use or scratching. I haven't tried out the USB yet but that will come later. At the moment I just want to HEAR my records again. The direct drive can stop on a dime! Pitch control is something I would never use but it has a nice feel to its "slide" and clicks into place in the middle. Hit "quartz" and it instantly tracks at the normal speed. The unit weighs around 25 pounds and that's a good thing. I've noticed that the Popup Stylus Target Light gets a little warm after it's been on for a while so I use it when I need it but mostly leave it turned off. Over a very good turntable which would fall under great if it were Made In USA with better quality control. Packaging from ZZOUNDS was also sturdy. It was packed in a box and sealed up very good in a plastic bag. The TT itself was nicely, tightly fit in the Audio Technica box. I almost bought the USB LP60 and I am glad I got this one instead. The direct drive and adjustable tone arm and anti-skate sold me on this model. One final note, if you find after a few plays of very old records that the tone arm skates across the record check the stylus to make sure it is clean. I made the mistake of playing some very old records without cleaning them and a considerable amount of dust was picked up by the stylus. I cleaned all of the records and cleaned the stylus gently with a new, unused toothbrush.                 
A good value - this turntable meets my requirements for diving back into vinyl. What a difference it makes for sound and enjoyment! I was pleasantly surprised at the heft on this table for the price point. The cartridge that came with it is fine - but will probably purchase a higher end cartridge at some point.
I'd prefer a semi-automatic belt drive table, but for the money this is the deal.                
I have been enjoying the heck out of this turntable for the past 3 months and I am very impressed. I grew up with the typical cheesey all in one systems that we all owned who grew up in the 70's-80's and I must say that this is much better by far. I thought that this would be a let down from my Music Hall 5 but I was wrong, it can perform and then some. Has plenty of bells and whistles which make it look really cool. I bought it to replace my Music Hall and to also add my album collection to my digital music platform in order to preserve my albums forever. It is simple and easy to use comes almost completely ready to go out of the box aside from just a few steps to get it put together and ready to play. It is packaged very well and is built like a tank. One of the cool things that this table does is allow you to play your albums backwards so that you can hear the hidden messages from the devil that your favorite band has put on there albums. The only bad thing that I can find wrong with this turntable is that it is silver, all of my equipment is black and so I kind of wanted it to be black as well. However, it does remind me of my first decent turntable that I bought in the 70's. Hope this helps you to decide on which turntable to get.                
Over all an outstanding product and value for its usability.  I would suggest everyone watch the set video. It explains the balancing of the styles arm much more thorough than the instructions provided.                  
I first ordered an entry level turntable and was just getting too much noise back through it (from my speakers).  This turntable does a much better job and I have no complaints about the sound at all.  Vinyl can sound much better than digital.                  
The features are OK and what you would expect on a professional quality turntable.  No frills to add noise like auto play or anything                
This is where it gets tricky.  I love the turntable, but it wasn't really designed very well.  The on/off switch is really stupid, its not like any I have ever seen and hard to use.  Its like a recessed knob and hard to reach, but it has a really nice start/stop button to get the platter going.  Why did we need both, why didn't the start/stop button also turn off the main power (really the only thing that comes on when you turn on the master switch is the strobe, you have to hit start to get the platter spinning)?  
Also the lifter is very small and not as good as it could be.  But then they go and add this huge speed control knob that is used very little.  Why didn't they make the lifter this nice since it will be used 100x more?                  
Very well made and lots of heft.  Other than the controls mentioned about I am very pleased with the quality.                
Good value, you would have to spend 2x to maybe get something better.  Its a great turntable for the money.  I got it open box and saved a bunch of money.                
Not had to need to contact AT, but ZZounds was great as always when I went to change out the other table.  Thanks to them, as always.                
Very sexy, but I am too old to fall for that trick, I want performance, that is what is sexy to me.                
It better last me a lifetime, unless I hit the lottery, then I my McIntosh tube amp will need something better.                
We had been warned that at our age(70s)that this machine was too complicated for us. People our age have very little experience with computers and the program(Audacity)requires some computer know how. The recording part of the program is not difficult it is when time to convert to MP3 that it gets tricky. But we did get some help and have been able to convert to MP3 and a thumb drive.                
I bought this turntable becuase my former crosley just was'nt doing the job! WOW! I'm impressed with this turntable! It is a tank. You do have to do some assembly like: the platter, and the tone arm. Don't worry, this isnt as hard as it seems:) The sound is outstanding, it has very accurate speed, and has an electronic brake. I have had no hum with the preamp, and desoite the fact that it is internally grounded, it still sounds good. I played a 45 and could not believe how good it sounded! I am pleased with the AT-LP120 USB! The Play As You Pay is very convinient and I love it! Fast Delivery! Thanks 1 million zZounds.com                
Easy to assemble, easy to hook up and very professional workings. Price $100 cheaper than in store com parables. A great buy                
I have been very pleased with the turntable except for one issue that is very annoying, the cueing mechanism lowers way to fast and the needle bounces on record. My brother has/had same turntable and it also bounced when lowering needle.                
it came quickly and it works. only complaint is that maybe you should make sure that 'fragile' is on the box because Fedex dropped it over our back gate to deliver it but luckily it functions fine. box was beat up a bit                
If I would have gone by the instructions provided by AT, I probably would have returned the unit, thinking that I got a dud. However, with some research and help from youtube and others, the issues, not mentioned in the owner's manual, were corrected quite easily and changed my initial impressions. I have not tried this unit in different settings, nor do I have plans to.                
I find the pitch control to be a great feature, especially since I bought a Mexican pressing of Devo's Freedom of Choice album from someone on Ebay and it sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks singing on my other turntable. The target light comes in handy as well.                
It took about 2.5 hours from box to good sounds. I don't think that quality control is the best in China, but I was able to overcome this by doing some research. I would not recommend that anyone get this turntable and blindly follow the manufacturer's suggestions as they are incomplete and don't take into consideration what can go wrong with factory assembly.                
It is very solidly built and appears that it would last a lifetime, but I can't say as I have only had this unit for 1 day. Cosmetically, it is a sexy beast!                
Time will tell if this unit will stand the test of time but initial impressions are good thus far.                
I did not have to contact the company regarding any of the adjustments I made.                
As I stated above, this unit is a sexy beast and once the adjustments were made, I was blown away as to how good this turntable could sound.                
I can't speak for all shipped units, but the one I just received needed much more than what the manufacturer suggested I do, with regards to setup. When I got the unit entirely assembled, the headshell was crooked and the sound was horrible when I played a record. On further inspection of the headshell, the cartridge was mounted improperly, so I adjusted that. I had to do some research with regards to the crooked headshell but found out that adjusting the azimuth would correct the problem. Thankfully, this one was adjustable, but was surprised it wouldn't have been accurately set at the factory. To adjust the azimuth, there are two Phillips head screws just behind the headshell, at the bottom of the tonearm. You will need a very short and small screwdriver in order to make this adjustment. Once those two adjustments were made, the turntable came alive and it sounds incredible, even with the stock cartridge.                
Let me start by saying I am not an audiophile. I do enjoy listening to music and just recently started listening to vinyl and I am very happy with this turntable. I've had a couple very cheap record players and the difference between those and this one are huge. The sound quality is truly amazing and the overall quality of the turntable seems to be very solid, it weighs a ton. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality turntable. The setup is pretty straight forward, Audio-Technica has videos posted on youtube that are easy to follow. I have not used the USB connection so I can't really comment on that.                 
Very nice turntable.  But, it may need some adjustments from the factory settings.  I found the tangent mounting of the AT95E cartridge to be way off thus affecting tracking. This needed to be reset - cartridge no longer sets square in headshell and that's ok.  Vertical tracking angle is wrong with AT95E. The tone arm was too high so the fix was to add several layers of thin foam under the slip mat. Tone arm front now raised about 5 mm and much more parallel to the record surface.                
Audio Technica always has been at the top of there game and as a dj I highly recommend  these turntables to anyone looking for something cheap and reliable I had them for 3 months and It just keeps wowing me I search and search for a imperfection but cant find it.                
I ordered a blemished unit for a good chunk off and it arrived super quick but packaged very poorly inside with all the accessories just bouncing around. Customer service was exceptional at getting me out another unit. I hooked it up last night and have to say it is a solid, heavy, & well built turntable. I for one don't believe that records sound better than CD's but I have a lot of both. You can't get the same volume levels from vinyl and I do get a hum from turning it up just like 30 years ago......... Also for some reason this one doesn't have an auto return at the end of the record??                
I brought this for my birthday. I was excited to get it but it did take me a few weeks to open it. The shipping box did not come in the best of shape. Regards everything appeared fine. Playing the first few songs it sounded amazing. Then I notice a drop in volume on the right channel. I thought it was the cables because I had RCA extension cable connect. Switched it, played an album or two and this it started happening again. I then hook the tunable to my studio mixer board without RCA extension cables and right away I could see no signal on the right channel. It was very random but I have come across some cases of this same matter on the internet. I was going to exchange it but it is out of stock so I did a return. I will try another one once zZounds get more in, but I am slightly worried about that now.                
The turntable works very well. I do wish I could load more than one record.                
Great turntable, my boyfriend loves it!                
Great turntable, my boyfriend loves it!                
This turntable is the finest in its price class. I have found it to be a joy to operate and use.                
Although this turntable is a nearly dead on copy of the Technics 1200, it does show its price point in a few areas. The stock cartridge is very average, the built in preamp must also be avoided. I purchased the Shure M97e, and also a stand alone preamp. After these purchases the turntable really comes to life. I also purchased a stock Technics rubber platter mat. All well worth the investment. If you plan to use this turntable 100% as is from the factory it will certainly do the job but why not invest in what you have and really make it sound its best.                
Yes it is very much worth it. But also be prepared to spend another $200 in several key areas to increase the turntables sound quality.                
If your going to get into listening to vinyl again like I have, this turntable is a great value that will last many years.                
Great product. Well built, just needs a few upgrades to perform at a high level.                
I cannot tell because I was using Audacity and it would allow me to use the sound from my monitor's stereo speakers.  It would be wonderful if you explained to anyone that has a MAC that they can use their own application Garage Band.  In that way all Apple users can benefit from using something that is very easy to work with to hear and record from the turn table.
As soon as I start listening I will let you know how the sound is.                
Al the features are great as far as I can tell.                
Because I was using Audacity I had to call to get the sound to play through my lap top's  speaker.  It gave me error message if I tried to use the Display setting.  Therefore I could not hear how it would sound  and until I start using it with the other software I will not know.  To go through all the steps regarding Audacity is very very difficult.  The pamplet has old diagrams and now where util the end do you see that you have to hit "record" to just listen to the record.                
It looks great and seems to operate well.  The turn table is quiet and I am happy to have a direct drive turntable.  It would be great if the turn tale  automatically removed the needle when it was finished.
I assume the turn table that I got is a copy of one of the Technics that used to be made.  It looks like it and hopeful it will sound like it.                
They were very helpful in walking through the Audix with me.                
Liked the way it looked and its features                
Until it doesn't function as it is supposed to this will do me fine.  I have grand children and want to burn CD's of the records that we send to their parents so I have the music                
My review title sums it up perfectly "Better than decent for the price. A good value." Before buying it I read many reviews for the Audio Technica ATR-1100. While the majority of reviewers liked this mic there were some reviews that were less than positive. I made my decision to buy this mic based solely on price alone and I don't regret it.Like any mic good microphone technique can make a difference and the Audio Technica ATR-1100 is no different. If you use good technique, mount it on a stand, and know how to set up and configure pc audio - your good to go with this solid mic.In years past I have used a Shure SM58 as a emcee in a live and loud environment and got great results. I bought this Audio Technica mic to practice my speaking and speech making at home.I've played around with it for a few days now and I like it. It does what I want.I rate the Audio Technica ATR-1100 microphone a solid four stars for everything except support (which I haven't used) and wow factor (it's a inexpensive mic - oh golly gee wow!).                
great qualty,and the sound is great                
no features i think it it should have it is great.                
it is easy and it is easy to modify the sound                
it is great condition  and is made well                
it is very cheap                
no.                
10 out of 10                
5-6 years                
It worked fine for a couple weeks but just stopped working for some reason. But it sounded good while it lasted.                 
It's very good for what I paid for it. I knew it wasn't going to be an SM-58, but I didn't wanna spend that kind of money.                 
bought it in a pack with a cord, mic stand adapter, and the mic. Very good way to sell stuff. plus it came with a nice little carry bag for the mic.                
Plug it in, turn it on, sing. Not difficult at all.                
Seems well made. Cable will probably be the first thing replaced.                
Well worth it.                
Haven't needed it yet.                
I'll use it till it's life span has expired.                
My daughter is picky about quality and i this microphone passed the test. She wanted something professional sounding, something she could listen to as she used it. Worked great . Thanks.                
I recently had to replace a 15 year old Win-XP machine ( I use a few programs that don't run on Win-8 or 10). I was able to secure one with no disc drive. Since my drives were good, it was the mother board that died on the old one. After installing my drives in the new box, I couldn't get the speakers to work. I found this product, ordered it and received in about two days. It works perfectly.                
This microphone actually exceeds my expectations.  Set up was simple and the mic is distortion free, with a clear reproduction that eliminates the annoying pops and hisses  that so often accompany working close to the mic.  I am happy with it.                
A lot better than in-camera mics in my Canon HG20, and 5D MkII. Worse than my pro audio mics.                
Amazing improvement to the camera sound for the price.                
Sometimes I need to do quick technical recording of rehearsals or small performances where large high-quality setup is not possible and is not justified. Such recordings work well for artist reviews, but its rather dissapointing to hear that nasty sound recorded through built-in mic. This external microphone is a perfectly priced replacement which makes such recordings easy to listen to.                
This mic is great for beginner film makers, for the price, the sound quality is good, offering a nice base level while keeping treble details sharp. The connections that it comes with aren't that good, you will need a shock mount from any music/audio store, or buy it online for $40. Otherwise, sounds from the boom operator can be heard through the pole, and any little bump will sound like an earthquake. The tele feature on the mic is not that great, it creates a large amount of white noise, but it can pick up a surprising amount of detail at long distances.                
I shot my first commercial with this mike. It picked up well, in fact too well as every little noise was heard through it. So next time the set will have to be exceptionally quiet to minimize the extraneous sounds. Good mike for the price.                
Excellent decision! This company works perfect for me. I recommend them, to everybody. And the mic works really good.                
The included ear buds are fine for general use but I've replaced them with Shure SCL5.  OTherwise the sound quality including frequency range are very good.  The optional limiter prevents the unit for exceeding safe listening levels.  I've experienced no interference or dropouts at a distance of about 50 feet between the transmitter and body pack.                 
The ability to feed the transmitter two channels off the sound board allows you to balance the receiver between one channel or the other.  So for my mix I have vocals on one channel and the band on the other.  Using the balance control on the body pack, I get both channels through both ear buds but can adjust the loudness of each to my preference.  I have the vocals turned up slightly higher than the rest of the band.  The ability to adjust the levels by myself rather than our sound guy gives me a custom mix.  I always leave the limiter on to avoid exceeding safe listening levels.  The body psck includes a jack to attach an ambient mic so that you can mix in audience sounds but I haven't found a need for this.                
Pretty simple really.  Plug in any ear buds and adjust the overall volume and balance between the two channels.  I replace the batteries before every show just to ensure that they don't run out during a performance.  I do the same thing with my wireless guitar transmitter and mics.                 
So far the unit has held up well.  I've dropped the body pack a couple of times but it has sustained no damage.                  
I haven't had to contact the company for support.                
Having made the transition from floor monitors to in-ear monitors, I can't imagine ever going back.                  
I would likely replace the M2 with another M2 as it meets my needs at a reasonable price.  The only reason I would consider another model is if I ran into some contention with wireless frequencies but so far it has worked flawlessly everywhere I've used it.                  
Just purchased it for about a month and up to now no problem. Did have to change the ear buds to some Shures just to have more clarity but other than that really reliable. Good service by zZounds!                
I absolutely love the sound quality and ease of use. As a Dj, I have gone throgh many headphones ( all brands) and finally got sick off how quickly they brake. Bought this, along with a different brand of ear buds (IE 30), used for first time in a club last night. I'm blown away with the quality & now have other DJ friends getting this. I love the fact you can choose from 100 channels, a opposed to 8 with the Shure ( for same price).                
100 Channels. Stereo, mono & mix control modes ( I use it in stereo mode for a cue & program feed). Limiter ( can be defeated but I would advise not to). Very good distance with no dropouts (within a few 100 feet). Belt pack is light.                
It only took minutes to set up channels and use.                
Both units seem to be well made & not cheap looking.                
I bought this from ZZ Sounds as a dent & scratch unit for $400. I cannot find any dents or scratches! The unit looks perfectly new.                
This is more practical than sexy!                
I will never go back to regular DJ headphones after using this.                
I own this stuff since 2 weeks. I checked it at the rehearsal room, and it works pretty OK. The earphones' wire is not too short (maybe is short for tall people- lol). I didn't experience any gig yet using this M2 (575-608 MHz). It didn't interfere with anything. It has a comfortable range. If in open air, it's around 100 m as they say in the specs.
I cannot say I would buy the same, because I didn't experience other brand/model.
I will come back with the review after a certain period of time to use it in gigs.
But, so far I am OK with it.                
std as others.                
It's pretty simple to use. Any musician can put it up and running in less than 5 minutes.                
Made in Japan. It says everything....                
OK.                 
Didn't need it so far.                
it's ok. Normal look.                
do not know. Maybe 5-6 years or so....                
Have been using these mics for over 4 years in all of our high school productions.  We normally take the lapel clip off of them and tape then onto the side of the face by the ear.  The sound quality is great, no crackling or distortion at all.  I have replaced on 3 out of 10 mics in the last year, one because someone forgot he which side he was wearing the mic when he got a pie in the face, and the other two because new students pulled too hard on the cords caught in clothing.  We rent these mics out during the summer to several community theaters also.  They are always a big hit with the sound ops.                
The Sound Was Geat, my school and chruch uses these microhpones and with some changes of the Mids we can get these mics working very nice. They deliver great sound quality for choirs, but i would reccomend then for mostly stage use.                
Not many features on a Mic, but it was very very easy to connect to our mixing console.                
Its just about a plug and play mic no set up, but really they need to be  positioned right or else it is hard to get a natural sound.                
Good Mic for the price, good quality                
Best Support is No Support ever Needed!                
This mic is good for the price, we use them for a stage overhead at my school and for a choir mic at my church!                
We use it only for live productions, in a small children's theater. I want it to help make the children heard better throughout the theater. It is presently hanging in the center of the stage, above the heads of the actors.  This is not working as well as I had hoped. Any suggestions?                 
It hangs, and it is small and out out of the way of curious hands.                
It works with our existing equiipment, we are still experimenting with the best placement on stage.                
seems to be well made                
seems to be                
no                
I use this hanging microphone in a small theater.  I like the fact that the child actors cannot pick it up and inadvertantly walk off with it, as children are prone to do,and it doesn't take up much space.                 
It has helped, I stil need a few individual mikes for the children with very soft voices.                
Great for theatres on a budget.  Exceptional quality for price.  The pickup is more towards the sides than front.  Be careful of comb filtering and phase cancelation.  Placement is tricky.  Less mics sometimes gives more gain.  I placed them 2 ft directly over actors noses. Highly reccomend.  low profile too.                
bendy bracket gives easy focus options as opposed to thick wire.                
Overall a very nice microphone system. Good sound quality with no interference. Easy to set-up and to use. I especially like the coiled cord for plugging the receiver into a camera. This is not meant for hiding the microphone itself (you will get scratching noises from clothing), but great for clipping to a lapel or pocket with the cord and transmitter hidden. The only potential issue is when you have the receiver plugged into a camera, the cord can pull out of the receiver if you pull the coiled cord too far. I fixed that by wrapping a length of double sided Velcro around the plug and the receiver.  I have not received any manufacturer support, so I do not have a rating for that area.                
Thank you AT for seamless backwards compatibility.  The end plug matched my 20 year old wireless transmitter pack, affording me more years of use from my excellent, if older, AT wireless rack system.                
Microphone and service were great!                
Works great, easy tos use and great price. I only wish it came with extra wind covers or had purchasing suggestions.                
The sound was okay to start with.  The design is poor.  Fits in the ears on a small head and you can't hear the monitors.  I used it at church only and after about 8 months it started cutting out.  Wiggle the mic and it would come on.  Finally about 13 months of mostly just a couple of hours on Sunday services it completely quit.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  The way the mic pivots and is connected is a poor design.                
No added features.                
Was great for a while then the connection got bad.                
Poor design.  Had to quit using it.  Cosmetically okay.  Too frail of wire connections and bad head wear design.  Only fits over the ears then you can't hear anything.                
For the price of the system not bad just need to redesign the headset the way it fits and the mic connection.                
It was out of warranty.  Didn't try to contact them.                
Bulky design, was just in the right price range at the time.                
Trying to find a better designed headset or get a Shure.                
I REALLY LIKED THE FIRST ONE UNTIL I BROKE IT AND THEN I REFUSED TO USE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE SAME MIC.  WE WERE IN A PINCH ON TIME AND I ORDERED IT THROUGH ZZOUNDS ON THE SATURDAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND RECIEVED IT ON THURSDAY THE 23RD OF DECEMBER SO WE WERE ABLE USE IT FOR THE PLAY ON CHRISTMAS EVE.  I AM REALLY PLEASED WITH THE MIC'S AND I AM SPEECHLESS ABOUT THE SERVICE AND SPEED WITH WHICH I RECIEVED MY ORDER.  I WILL USE NOBODY ELSE EXCEPT ZZOUNDS FROM NOW ON.  
                THANKS ZZOUNDS GREAT JOB                
I've owned the Audio Technica Pro8HeX for 5 years now.  Is it gonna sound like an SM-57 or 58?  No.  But, if you are a singing drummer doing backups, this mic' is a good, solid, if unspectacular option.                
The Audio Technica Pro8HeX is a wired headset, and has a handy clip for making sure the wire doesn't get in the way.  I use mine for backing vocals while drumming with my band, Scream, so I attach the clip to the pocket of my pants, running the wire down my back.  There's nothing fancy needed with this mic', and that's what I like.                 
The Audio Technica Pro8HeX is a solid, steady mic.  But like most other headsets, it's going to sound thin.  Your soundman (or you) will need to tweak your channel settings on your board.  If you have a deeper voice, like me, you'll need to cut some of the highs and boost the bottom end.  It'll never sound like an SM-58, but for your dollars spent, the sound is decent, once you tweak it.                
The Audio Technica Pro8HeX is built like a tank.  When I first purchased mine 5 years ago, I actually bought 2, one for a back-up, just in case. (I'm somewhat anal like that.)  I have yet to break out the backup mic'.  The original one has been in use 3 nights a week for five years with absolutley no failures whatsoever.                
Great bang for the buck!  Best value in headset microphones on the market today.                
-Have not needed AT support-                
Doesn't look sexy, but it's light and comfortable on the head.

No.  But, if you are a singing drummer doing backups, this mic' is a good, solid, if unspectacular option.  It never feeds back, it's rock-solid and tough as nails, and light.  The sound is a bit thin, but your soundman can dial it in for you by cutting some highs and boosting the bottom end.                  
Great articulation.  Just enough low end with anice midrange and just enough top end.  Fits my voice and its purpose, which is good articulation for Amateur Radio SSB audio                
Two windscreens included, although the big one is, well, REALLY big!.  The small one does a great job when close talking the microphone.                
Has a pronounced proximity effect for base.  You have to use the windscreen, or you can pop plosives easily.                
Solid, stays where you put it.  Its a bit on the tight side for my temples, but I can move it around to work around my glasses.                
Great value for the money.  I would say it is priced well.  Wish it came with a closed cup headset, then I would never look at Heil again.                
I have owned and/or used AT products in the past, both personally and in my work, and have never needed to contact the factory for any issue.  Solid reliability!                
Its a microphone, that fits on your head and you speak on it.  Its as reliable as a Hockey Puck or a Paper Clip.  And it sounds just wonderful, with rich full sound with very good midrange articulation, which is what is needed for SSB audio.                
Been working fine when I use it, about three months now, with several transmitters.  Easy to equalize to sound just the way you want to sound since it is so well balanced tonaly.  I really wish you could get this mic capsule with full ear cup sound sealing headsets.  As it is now, I can only use it with speakers, must use my other Heil headset in contesting, which is a shame, since this mic sounds so good.                
I think the sound is pretty good.  I read another review before purchasing the mike that panned the sound.  There advantages to stand mikes but for what I needed this is pretty good.  It tends to pop without the included wind shields.                
It's very light weight and I didn't need a long cord but that wouldn't be a problem if I needed one.  I wish it had a switch.  At the end of my concerts I move around and I have to take the thing off which so far has resulted in a loud thump and scratching sound.  I have to grab for the mixer now.  A switch would be nice.                
works good for me.                
It seems to be a little light weight but that's also an advantage.  I always have backups for almost everything.  Right now that's a stand mike.  I'm a sax player so the vocal stand mike gets in my way.  I am always on the road traveling somewhere to gigs and I can't go back for something.                
yes                
no problems                
I don't wear it around my head because I often have a hat on so I put it around my neck outside my coller.  It doesn't interfere with my sax neckstrap since it's lite weight too                
I was originally going to go wireless but since I am only a couple of feet from my mixer the cord length and all the extra junk I would have to carry for wireless makes wireless less than attractive although it has it's advantages too.  I will order another one soon.                
I dont sing lead vocals so I wasnt going to spend a boat load of money on a head worn mic . This thing dose the job for me . this thing stays on my head like its suppose too ! There have been times when I forgot I had it on and walked off before unpluging it , then stepped on it as I went to pick it up . No worries , the thing just keeps on working like nothing ever happened ! If I were a lead singer then maybe I would get something better...maybe .                   
Very good for the money. Fits well (if you bend it a little(I have a very big head)). Sounds surprisingly good (for the price) and has great feedback rejection. It's no Crown CM311, but then that one cost 6 times as much!                
The sound is better than I expected.  I am not a pro but a few gigs at Nursing Homes.  I was very pleased with the sound from this mic.                
The mic is very easy to use.  Fits well and is much lighter than I would have thought.  I actual forget I have it on.  The only down side to it is it does not have a on/off switch.  Other than that it is perfect.                
I expect to use this mic for a long while.  If I lost it or it was stolen I would buy another just like it.                
The Mic. is very true sounding as I have a very long vocal range from high Bass to low Tenor.  I'm also a Drummer/Percussionist and play a wide range of instruments, none of which are picked up with the Mic. while singing.  Keeping the Mic. as close to your mouth as possible is the best way to avoid picking up background sounds.                
Can be worn left or right so as not to interfere with a monitor.                
Put it on and sing.                
Seems well built.                
A real value.                
The only other comparable product was $350.00 and this one was $80.00                
I would purchase another unit without hesitation                
Pros: Comfortable to wear for a full music set (1 hour), sound is clear and accurate, gear is lightweight.
Cons: Cord clip is hard to use, gear is not practically designed for glasses (not sure how it could be changed).
Additions: Add an in-line on/off switch                
Nice sound, comfortable, decent cable. I only wish it had an on-off switch, but that's a minor issue. I needed a good sounding affordable mic and I found it!  Haven't needed any manufacturer support, so I can't truly rate it.                
This product sounds wonderful, but the lifespan of a headset is very short. Over the past few years of using it for teaching spinning classes, with 20 hrs. of use per week, I have found that the longest one has ever lasted is maybe 5 months. I have had some that have only worked for as short as 2-3 wks before shorting out and sending back to Audio Technica under warranty. They need to work on improving their last quality of their product.                
as stated above..these headsets do not have a long lifespan before shorting out and not working                
I have to continue using it because all of my mic recievers are Audio Technica so i need to keep purchasing from that company. due to the lifespan of the headset, when my reciever dies, I will try to find another manufacturer.                
Purchased this for my wife, who sings along with playing her guitar. Has made her more mobile and she loves it.                
OK so the sound is pretty decent and met my expectations.  I actually use this to do vocal recordings on material when I have to be a way from my home studio and can't be bothered bringing my large diaphragm mic.  So of course the quality is not as good as even a low end studio mic.  But still it is pretty decent and very even.  I would say that it is considerably better than a PA mic (say an SM57/SM58).  Then again it is designed as a stage mic for drummers I believe.                
The way it attaches to your head works very well.  Would appreciate a longer cord but can live without that.                
nothing to it                
I probably did not pack it well in my suitcase and one of the clips that holds the pads in place went missing.                
Really good value.  I had looked long an hard for a head worn mic that would fit my budget.                
Hard to consider it sexy but it certainly does the job.                
The sound quality is exactly what I expected . Crisp and clear . Less feed back problems than the other mics in my arsenal . Certainly cuts through mix nicely .                
The best feature is the lack of features . It does what its supposed to do without any bells and whistles . Could use an on/off switch but that is not really a problem .                
Sits on your head and doesn't move around like some others . Easily adjusted for comfort and use .                
Lightweight and tough enough to last you for a long time . I guess if you mistreat the thing it will quit on you , but that would be user error ......                
I paid $120.00 for mine and will gladly do so again should something happen to the one I have now .                
I have no idea as I haven't ever needed to contact them .                
Its a Plain Jane that gets the job done . Thats appealing to me .                
More comfortable than any of the others ( and theres been a few ).
Sounds good , dependable and you don't need to take out a loan to get one . What else do you want ?                
The product performs exactly as it said it would.  It allows our choir to concentrate more on the quality of their sound rather than the volume.  Everyone at our church has been impressed so far.                
It's a choir microphone and it fits the bill for that nicely.                
Very easy, just hang from the ceiling and plug into your mixer.                
Product is smaller than you would expect yet delivers good quality sound and volume.                
Seems to be worth the price at this point.                
I give ZZounds a 10 because they have always delivered excellent support and service.  Never had to use the manufacturer so far.                
It just hangs there from the ceiling and does it's job.  Most people don't even notice it's there since we purchased the white one to match our ceilings.                
I expect this to last us for years.                
I am truly enjoying every minute of this cartridge on my table!! 
 I have owned several turntable cartridges on the budget end, some from Audio-Technica.  The last cartridge I owned was the Nagaoka MP110.  Although i love that cartridge and the warm, open sound it provides, i felt that something was missing on the top end. I wanted something with just a little more detail in the treble, while avoiding something that was going to be too harsh or bright in my system.  
I took a chance, and ordered the AT VM740ML, and let me say I am extremely happy with the results!!  It really breathed new life into my vinyl.  The detail in the treble is there, without being too bright, harsh, or fatiguing.  It's just right.  The increased treble did not come at the expense of the bass and midrange, as both are full and detailed. The soundstage presented is great, with vocals and instruments always falling in their proper place in the mix.  The MicroLine stylus from Audio-Technica just digs out all sorts of details in songs that I never knew was there. If it was recorded in the song, it's going to find it and present it to you. Every album I throw at it is handled beautifully and tracks it like a champ with no inner grove distortion whatsoever. 
In summary, I am really impressed with this cartridge in Audio-Technica's VM700 series and I hope to try their Special Line Contact stylus one day in the future.                  
As a guitarist friend told me when I was in his music store buying DIs, "The Countryman is like a Toyota. The Avalon is like a Benz." Several months of using this and a few other DIs in a variety of situations have definitely confirmed that statement. Turn off the "tone" circuit and you have a pure signal from your instrument that isn't colored at all, positively or negatively. All of the transients are there in detail and there is no flagging in the lower frequencies. Turn on the "tone" circuit and you're able to pick from some well thought out presets, all of which are useful in situations where you're plugging something in and need a quick setting.                
I gave this a nine on features because it's not necessarily a swiss army knife device. That said, DIs aren't supposed to be. Do you want something that gives you parametric EQ? Do you want thick, tubey tone to warm up your acoustic guitar's stock pickup? Do you want a mic preamp? Get something that isn't a DI. A DI is supposed to take the signal and boost it enough to get it down the line to the mixer before sending it to your amp. This thing does way more than that. Any rating of the features of a DI needs to take that into consideration. My only gripe is that it can't be phantom powered, but I'm guessing that they did that because you need more juice to get as accurate a signal as the Avalon will deliver.                
My five year old daughter could be shown how run this thing in minutes. The only thing you might even need a manual for is an explaination of the tone curves.                
Built like a tank. This unit is widely used by professional touring companies.                
When you're talking about close to $600 for a DI, you have to really need that quality level. At some point you encounter diminishing returns for your money and in a blind listening test I doubt that the uneducated listener is going to be able to tell the difference between an Avalon DI'd signal and a Countryman DI'd signal. But if you're doing an album or running sound in a really nice place, the Avalon is totally worth it. I gave it an eight just because it's a high end piece of gear, and pretty much no high end gear can be considered "value" priced.                
I haven't needed to call them. I expect that they are quite bored at the Avalon service center.                
It looks sexy. It sounds great. It's practically legendary. My only gripe is the form factor: two rack spaces tall and half a rack wide is almost unusable. And $70 for rackmount gear is robbery.                
A few minor niggles will prevent this from being a home studio gem (and they're all price related) but the idea of not owning one on a serious project is laughable. I'll always have one around if money is on the line.                
I had no idea how powerful this thing was. Now I have to upgrade my cabs because my powered monitors can't handle her.  All Hail the Queen!                 
not that impressed! my digitech gsp1101 has just as good di built in 
actually im thinking of sending this back, doesnt really do anything for sound in my studio 600.00 hype i had to try, but trust me not worth it. also my countryman sounds just as good                
The U5 alone has not helped me achieve quality guitar sound. This is what I did expect to get from it.  However, it certainly is a quality product, in my opinion probably best suited for bass players, and perhaps vocals but I have not attempted to use it for vocals at this point as I am still pursuing quality guitar sound.  I will certainly keep it as when I start to record bass there is not doubt the sound it does push for bass is the best I have heard.  Don't get me wrong, this is a worthwhile investment if your looking to get more then one use from it!                
I plugged a PRS Swamp Ash Special into it.  I cannot get a quality signal into my yamaha recorder with it.   The bass sound over rides any highs you may achieve.                
It's easy to use.  There is not manual.  Just a 2 page fold out which is all you need as it's quite straight forward.                
The products is made well.  However, if your overseas in a country that is on 220-240 power like I am, it's stated that it's multi-voltage, which it is, however the switch is actually inside of the unit which means you must find something to stick thru the air vent to switch it over to 240.  This is the first I've seen this.  A big plus is that before you'll blow the unit up, you'll simply blow the fuse which is quickly replaceable.  If Avalon did this intentionally they cold teach many other companies a few things as I have seen many persons over here fry their stereo's and TV's.                
The product is worth the money.  Again, although I did not achieve what I wanted, it's still produces and bass tone like I have never been able to produce, or have even heard from the bands and musicians I have played with.                
Have not had to deal with them.                
I am already searching for something to supplement the U5 in order to get treble tone.  I tried two smaller pre-amps that I already own but, although getting acceptable sound, I still will try others.                
Tight, punchy, and extremely clean.  Nothing I have yet heard sounds better for recording bass.                
Not feature-laden at all, but I was never really left wanting.  It does what it does extremely well.                
It's very expensive relative to other excellent DI boxes, but it is absolutely the top of the heap.  Honestly, it's worth whatever you pay for it.                
No experience here                
How "sexy" is a DI box?  It's utilitarian, really, it just makes everything better.  The person who finds that concept appealing, you will also enjoy this product                
I use it as a preamp and DI for bass guitar in live situations.  It produces a clear, deep tone with little coloration, allowing the true sound of the instrument to come through.                 
This category is hard for me to rate.  The U5 is intended to be used as a DI.  Accordingly, the controls are minimal.  Don't forget that many DI's offer no control at all.  Using it as preamp, I find myself wishing for a parametric EQ and perhaps a compressor, but it's a little unfair to expect these on a DI.  That said, there are advantages to a simple control layout, and the U5 manages to produce good tone in almost all situation eve without the EQ or compression that a true preamp unit might offer.                
The U5 is (like all Avalon products) a top quality unit.  Tough as nails-- I don't hesitate to travel with it and have used (and abused!) mine extensively with no problems.                
As Di's go, this a pretty pricey one, and not cheap even when compared with preamps.  That said, sometimes you *do* get what you pay for.  The Avalon delivers good sound, is tough enough for live work, and is very easy to use.                
No experience on this.                
Without a doubt the best sounding direct box made! It has about 8 different settings voiced for specific instruments.                
It would be nice if they included the rack-mount kit instead of selling it for $80. If it had a mute switch it would be perfect.                
Well built & road worthy. Plus, it looks cool!                
Expensive and worth it if you demand the best. You'll know where the extra $'s went as soon as you plug in!                
Never had a problem so I never needed 'em.                
Showing up with a U5 instantly buys you credibility with engineers and other musicians. Having one in your studio impresses clients. This peice of gear lets people know you are SERIOUS about your tone!                
I'm a pro bass player and bought mine used a couple of years ago. I bought it for sessions (and it works great) but I got a touring gig this year so I put it in my live rack. I figure if I play a good guitar into my Avalon and send that signal to the engineer it will be hard for him to screw up my sound in the house! The U5 will be the last link in my signal chain for a long time.                
This is the standard to which all others are compared.  Beautiful, clean, clear "glassy" tube sound, warm yet clear.  The best.                
Everything you need in a channel strip: preamp, equalizer, compressor.                
Solid, heavy, metal everything.  I worry my rack will break.                
I paid $1400 new, so it was worth that to me.  It is a bit pricey at the usual $2000 price tag.  But worth it!                
Haven't had to find out (there's no N/A choice).  Everyone I talked to and everything I read says Avalon gives great support.                 
It's a beautiful piece of gear that inspires great confidence.  The Avalon name is well known to everyone in this business, like Neumann mikes or Vox amplifiers, it actually brings in customers.                
This preamp (plus a great mike) gives my customers and me no excuse for not recording great vocals.   I also have a Joe Meek pre which is dirty and therefore complementary to the Avalon.                
This box produces a big, detailed and warm sound that quite frankly beat the pants off much more expensive pieces, such as some of the Focusrite Red units. I used it in a broad range of applications, ranging from pop/rock to jazz and classical, and it always shined.                
The is an extremely flexible unit.                
It is built like a tank, has an excellent fit, looks great and very clean build quality                
I would have paid $3,000 for this box. Along with my api outboard gear, and my Distressor, this is one that has never let me down. Buy iy.                
Never had any problems, so support was never an issue.                
It is gorgeous!                
Great quality.  used with various genres.  with it could be 8 payments instead of 4.  that's the only downfall.  but its worth it!!!                
the avalon is alright a lot of it is hype.i had the chance to compare it to the la 610 mkii on every level an the la610 just sounded better period.depending on what sound your looking for,dont be fooled by the price thinking its the best just cause it cost 2250.00.i feel the la610 was more cleaner,although the avalon has more eq control you have to look at the whole pic.but every piece of gear has pro&cons.                
i just wish it wasnt so heavy an that it cost much less                
not complicated at all                
it is built like a train                
my opinion this thing is not close to being worth what they sell it for                
support was helpful                
it is very eye catching                
its ok for now but if it messed up i wouldnt get another one                
There is a certain amount of sound quality that is required to make good sound. All of it is subjective in my humble opinion. That opinion is based on 35 years of playing to crowds ranging from 100 to 5,000 people.  I find the unit responds well, and is more than acceptable in quality where the patches and sounds I've created are concerned. It is all opinion and opinionsvary according to taste. The only constant is good clean sound that is altered according to the need at any particular time. I like this unit.                
I like the color, wieght and look of the unit, programming options, the amp models offered, the fact that it can be updated with new user sounds,and the MIDI function. With any piece of equipment you must experiment and find the limitations and learn to milk it for every good thing you can get out of it. This unit is no different. Learn to use your tools and you will be happy with them.                
I'm still learning about the unit but am happy with what I have learned so far, Theprogramming is going well so far. That means for my personal taste, I am gettingwhat I am looking for. I use this unit with a Tech 21 Power engine, a 2 x 12 modeland also a 1 x 12 model.                
I like the look of it and weight . I like the way it is laid out and the menus are OK. As far as dependable, well, I can only hope as I just bought it. But I did buy it.                
If your not going to use the unit for any thing but playing out, well, it's a tough call.That will be the main use of it for me, but I knew that going into the purchase and accepted it. In actuality, I'd say most should look at it as an all around tool forrecording and live use in order to get the most satisfaction for their purchase.                
No I haven't. I checked out some videos on the Tube channel and only found onenegative review from a person that bought a used unit who was knocking the company for their service. Like old Forrest Gump said. "It happens." That's life. I've found some companies respond in kind. So if I have to deal with them, I givethem the kind that I would like to receive in return and it usually works out.                
I don't buy on impulse. I looked at the unit for 1 year before I made the purchaseand didn't buy it from the store I planned on buying it from. So that should tellanyone reading this that zZounds it a store that I enjoy.                
I bought the Eleven Rack because I like the Tweaking method available. It is similar to using a head, and I'm old school, I like knobs. The added benefit to having the amp models and effects in one unit, along with the MIDI control capability is exactly what I wanted. I considered the new Vyper amp, the Digitech unit and even a couple Multi effects units and decided to take a different path this time around. And strangely enough, I like the color. Also, it is a little heavier that it looks. I think that is a good thing as I have paid more in the past for units that felt as flimsy as printing paper.but found this unit to be more of what I wanted                
I purchased the Avid Eleven Rack with Pro Tools about 4 years ago and I have never had any issue with it. I have played at countless shows using the eleven rack as either a bass rig or guitar rig sent direct to the board. It has been a show saver on the gigs where storage space was limited. I have also recording hundreds of demos using the eleven rack as an interface. The guitar tones are great after some tweaking and adjusting the tones to match your guitar set up. The ability to connect external pedals is a fantastic feature as well and works great. It also has a midi input that I use for recording electronic drums in Pro Tools, which is great because I can record an entire session using only one interface. Like anyone, I would love to own one of the new rack mounted Kemper profiling amps, but as far as affordability and the ease of recording goes, the Eleven Rack is an obvious choice. It does take time to fully understand how to use and operate the eleven rack, but once you figure it out, the possibilities of creation are endless. Pair it with a midi control board like a ground control or the more affordable Behringer boards, and you've got a solid live unit. And if you're not into running direct live guitar, (which works fantastically for in-ears) you also have the option of adding a power amp and using a cabinet. Again, it will take a fair amount of time to find a tone to properly match the power amp with the cabinet you are using, but if done properly, you can definitely create a tone you are happy with. It also has a headphone jack on the front of the device for those much needed late night silent practices. Its a fantastic way to downsize for the gigging guitarist, as well as a fantastic intro into the world of recording for anyone that is interested in learning. I take this unit with me everywhere, it is my lifeline. Pick one up immediately, you will not be disappointed.                 
I can't give this a 10 because, obviously there are better sounding mic's out there...BUT for the PRICE...this is an OUTSTANDING VALUE!!!                
10 dbl Pad AND Roll Off....in a $180 mic...that comes in an OAK, VELVET lined wooden box INSIDE an Aluminum Case WITH a Shock Mount and extra Shock Mount Winding.....for the money.....THERE IS NO BETTER VALUE!!                
Plug it in...set the switches...turn on the Phantom Power and set the levels....does't get any easier then that!                
Chrome Plated Nickel Diaphragm cage and Cabernet Painted BRASS Capsule.  Sound quality is SPECTACULAR!                
BANG FOR BUCK....this IS the Mic!!!                
Haven't had it long enough to put Avant Support to the test....hope I don't have to!                
It's a beautiful piece of equipment!  AND housed in a beautiful Velvet Lined and padded Oak Box INSIDE an Aluminum case WITH a VERY NICE RETRO Shock Mount.  VERY NICE!!!                
I think I will be quite satisfied.                 
I recieved my CK-6 as a gift, and what a gift it is! I own an Avantone CV-12 so just for fun we A/B'd the two.(The we being 3 sound engineers with over 30+ yrs experience each) Then we A/B'd it with an AKG 420, AKG 220, similar budget mics, price-wise.  The CK-6 proved to be better than the 220 w/o a doubt. The CK-6 and AKG 420 were close in price, but 2 out of 3 chose the Avantone. What blew us away was testing  CK-6 against  the CV-12, a mic that is a quality tube mic with 9 p/u patterns. Both Avantones have a "tone", as do the AKG's; different brands,different tones even with same specs. The CV-12 beat them all, hands down, but the 6 shined in so many ways, all 3 of us had to admit we were shocked. The CK-6 is an awesome mic,worth every penny, hard to believe it cost less than 200 spending gitas! Seriously, call zZounds today and order yours...be happy like me!                
I fired up this mic on a new gospel song I recorded yesterday and I must tell you the sound quality blew me away!                
Yes                
Setup was a breeze.                
This mic is well designed and it looks great!                
It is worth every penny.                
The mic has a classy look.                
I plan to purchase 3 mics for my mic cabinet in a few weeks.                
The Avantone CV-12 Tube Mic is an excellent choice for vocals. Amazing warmth and an airy top end, with very good control of sibilance, are this mic's main features. it's a vintage sound for sure; however, detail in the top end is very clean, and the noise floor is audibly as low as contemporary FET condensers. Works well with acoustic instruments as well. The vintage-style shock mount is a bit clunky (thumb screws as opposed to spring clamps), but the CV-12 will fit nicely in most modern shock mounts. Did I mention it's a beautiful mic, the body painted a deep red? Fast becoming my go-to mic!                
This microphone has made a wonderful difference in my vocals. My vocals are thick and full and not so bright as other microphones. I have ahad a major DeEssing issue and this mic has made a significant difference.                
I purchased one, a great deal at this price. These are solid mics, very useful on every session. Has a natural compression vibe. It will grab an ocassional "s", instead of compressing, just have vocalist move back just a bit. Sounds spectacular with any pro level preamp. It's fantastic on just a basic setting, but as you learn a thing or two about micing techniques you really understand how awesome your CV12 really is. Fig 8 a source, also Fig 8 with a good ribbon mic on same source, compare both. A very accurate mic, a solid addition to a professional studio mic locker. Best in price range if you need a tube w/multi-pattern pickup.                
I just received mine, I can't get it into the shockmount. My unboxing experience consisted of oogling the mic and power supply, reaching into the case, removing the shockmount, and having all the bungee cords dislodge themselves.Honestly very disappointed. Luckily it fits into my AKG-style shockmount but why spend the money developing a mount this worthless?                
Great sound, looks great. Only had it about a month, but it has become my favorite mic in my studio.                
I've only had it about one month, but I love it. Looks good, plays great, sounds great. I haven't had to use the support, so can't comment on that part. Overall very happy.                
I use the Avantone MixCube to reference monitor in mono. While I'm usually mixing on a pair of full range speakers I find that the MixCube is unusually accurate and revealing in the mid range, as well as surprising revealing in dynamics and reverb. As much as I use and love this monitor I would not recommend it to anyone who doesn't already have a set of full range monitors. The highs and lows are a tad lack luster, but of course that's one of the main reason's I purchased it. I would say it emulates the functionality of a Yamaha NS-10. On the downside, when I first received this product it had a damaged pot and the amp wasn't working properly. zZounds.com quickly remedied the issue by sending me a new one, it took about a week. The one they sent seems to have somewhat of a sticky power switch compared to the last one which is strange, but it sounds great and that's what matters. In conclusion, this little speaker looks great, sounds great, and is becoming an essential part of my mixing routine. It's a workhorse to say the least.                
The Avantone is one of the best mix tools you can buy after investing in a good set of full range monitors. Due to its limited frequency response and by using only one of these in mono, you can quickly hone in on a proper balance. I was amazed when I first set this up and listened to a mix I had almost finished. What I thought was a well balanced mix was not. Certain tracks were overpowering others. Vocals were rough. I was hearing distortion that I didn't hear on my stereo monitors. I realized I was over-driving and clipping some of my plugins. Once I corrected the mix and got it to sound good on the Avantone, I switched back to the stereo monitors and was blown away by how much better it sounded. 
I would highly recommend this monitor to anyone who wants to do any serious mixing. The build quality seems very high. When you first see the smooth shiny surface, you think it is plastic, but once you feel it and pick it up, you know that it is a heavy wood shell with a durable lacquered finish. 
The only negative aspect of the product is the power button. It should be located on the front or side. With it being on the back, you have to either feel around for the switch or turn the speaker to power it up or down. Not very convenient, especially if it is set back on a console shelf. But this is a minor annoyance once you hear the results of using it.
Buy one and you will be thrilled that you did after you hear the difference it makes.                
These cubes are a bit pricey, but well worth the money. Built solid, quality you can feel the first time you pick one up. The cones are virtually indestructible, they can take all the punch I can throw at it! The unique zero enhanced flat response make my mixes click every time.  These replaced a set of BX5's and if they ever blow I'll replace them with an identical pair!                 
The best advantage of the  Mixcubes is that they are really small. If space is limited, these guys are definitely attractive. But, each monitor has a separate power supply block that is kinda bulky (about 3"x4"x5") with cables exiting opposite ends, so keep that in mind. Sound is as expected, full range and bright with its small driver. Sticker price is a bit steep, but I think the overall value seems good enough. Hoping these will last well over 10 years!                
Wasn't to difficult to install, looks great. Really stable, stays in tune really well after aggressive whammy use. I highly recommend, for a non locking trem system this one is worth the money                 
I have a Warmoth korina bodied Strat that I’ve not been really satisfied with soundwise,it had no real fullness or depth to the tone,so I ordered this bridge from zZounds last nite and it arrived today(!!) the speed of delivery by zZounds is the next best thing to teleportation!
Anyways,the install was super easy. Setup takes some getting used to,especially if you are old school like me and eyeball the string height. Intonation was right on the money. One of the good things I noticed was the lack of adjustment screws digging into my hand when I rested on the bridge. Soundwise,I noticed more sustain right away and a little deeper tone,but I think that will improve with time and playing it more. I don’t use my trem,I just like the sound of the hint of reverb from the springs,something which is really noticeable on a stock six screw tremolo but I haven’t been able to crank up the amp for a proper listen,not until this weekend.so,sounds better,looks cool,solid as a rock.                
perfect addition to overhauled pawn shop special chinese strat knock off...looks amazing sounds as good as it looks!!!                
If you sing and play acoustic guitar and track separately, This is a perfect mic for that. Its very good at bringing out the detail and sparkly tone of the guitar to the point of being almost tactile. And with voice it has a very clear and intimate presence.                
i just started recording a new album in my studio, and this mic sounds sweet. it brings out the subtle nuances of the vocalist with ought adding too much color. gives a lot of headroom to play. this is my first high grade solid state mic, and I'm in love! btw its gorgeous.                
I've had this mic for over 10 years and use it primarily for vocals where it excels. It is bright and airy but I wouldn't use it for a source where you wanted some beefy low end. If you want one mic for all kinds of things I would look elsewhere. If its primarily for vocals where they need to cut through the mix, this could be the one.
NICE SOUNDING MIC,IT'S A LITTLE TOO TOP ENDED (TREBLE)BUT NOT TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S TINNY. WORKS FAIRLY WELL ON ACOUSTIC GUITAR,PIANO, AND VOCALS                
NO ROLLOFF,OR ATTENUATOR SWITCHES. STILL WORKS WELL ENOUGH IN MOST SITUATIONS WITHOUT THEM.                
I OWN IT                
I connected this mic to wa73 through apollo twin.. raw sound this feels like a dark kinda low tone but didn't really detect the top crispy many say... makes me wonder if they applied eq when tracking. Raw vocal seemed a bit under and after I mix vocals came out good but not great. For me the neuman tlm 103 sounded better to me than this. in my op.... so it was ok mic not bad but not best. Was not wowed at all by this.. should be more like a 699$ mic not 1k.                
Although the mic has an airy essence to its highs, it creates a very smooth sound with very even output.  If youre looking for something thats just for vocals then take this Blue over the Dragonfly otherwise I think the Dragonfly is more universal.                
Cool options that are blockbuster bling bling, like the custom pop filter and the shock mount.  Motivates its users to a whole new level.                  
Doesnt get much better than BLUE when it comes to quality.  Each mic is tested before it leaves manufacturing and is hand built.                
Great looking mic with equal capacity to perform.  With a mic like this its up to the engineer to tweek the sound cause theres no doubt the mics done its job.                
Extremely silky mic with fantastic character.  I highly recommend this microphone.  I mainly use it for vox and accoustic instuments.                
Everything you need but the talent.                
Truly easy to set up.                
What can you say about Blue products?  Great quality.                
I can't believe the mic sells at the price that it does.  However, that was yet another deciding factor for my purchase.                
Have not had a need.                
I have it!!!!                
I am getting at least two more of these mics.  I expect to use them until I die.                
just compare it side by side to any other mic besides a tube mic and then compare prices. this one blows them away, on quality and price.                 
excellent built in shock mount.                
I agree with the others, blue always emails me back with help when I need it.                
It looks awesome too, but that doesn't help the sound.                 
I like  My microphones . I've used every good brand out there when it comes to mics. My favorite microphone for a smooth sound is at4050. I like it more than the neumanns. But the presence that the blue dragonfly has is incomparable . Clear , crisp and very enhancive to a regular voice . Fully recommend it to anyone that can afford it .                  
This Mic has a wonderful silkiness and accuracy about it. Especially for wind instruments and hand percussion. Though I have yet to throw something at it that it didn't caprture exceptionally well. It out performed mics with a much larger price tag.                
Being a mic, it did not come with accessories, but the screws that are used to hold the diaphram in place after use are a good idea for extending the life of the mic. Also, the built-in shock mount is a really nice design idea and works very well for supporting the mic.                
Nice, tight design. solid where it needs to be, light where it doesnt.                
Bottom line, for the money you pay you get 20x the mic! This is an outstanding piece of equipment.                
n/a                
Many people say that with a BLUE mic your paying for the name, which is true to some degree. the BLUE mics all have unique design and are very "collectable".                
Until i can afford a $2500.00 mic, the Dragonfly more the fits my needs for a great overall recording mic. Great, flat responce, wonderful range... not much more to be said.                
When you find the right place for it, it's one of the best guitar amp mics you will EVER find.                
Integrated shock mount saves you from having to buy one.  Head can be rotated many degrees for flexible placement.                
Please - B.L.U.E. makes their own screws!  Let alone the grill quality, the box and contact quality, etc...                
With the recent drop to the $800 range, this is a better value than when they first hit the market.                
Who are these JERKS who put a "1" for customer support?  Did you ever call B.L.U.E.??? You probably have a phone that say's Fisher Price on it, because I have the dog gone CELL numbers of some of the guys there in case I have problems.  Try that with some of the other mic vendors - I dare you!                
It's pretty good on electric guitars,but please don't think of using it on vocals. It's nasty on all the singers I've tried it on.                
no rolloff or attenuator                
overpriced...I don't care if Blue makes their own screws!                
A mic priced at this level should work on vocals too!                
I was on the waiting list before this was released, and I wanted to wait a bit before commenting.
This unit is really great.  It's extremely easy to operate.  There is a great selection of many, many beats that all sound so real it's almost impossible to believe.  Having had both an Alesis SR-16 and SR-18, this thing blows them away.
Since it's so easy to change drum kits, I've been playing around with selecting beats I wouldn't normally use as-is, such as some of the hip-hop beats, and assigning them different kits such as "brushes" or "ethereal", and the results are amazing.
The timing of the pedal stomps for transitions was a little hard to get the hang of, but I'm to the point now where I can basically "write a song" on the fly and not make any transition mistakes, and I barely glanced at the manual, so it's really not hard.
I also have the external footswitch, the official one.  I was pleased to see when I plugged it in and configured it, that it did an auto-detection to see if the switch plugged in was latching or non-latching, so in theory you should be able to use any dual footswitch.  I play with a "looper" for my guitar, and the stomp-stop/stomp-start is very handy to get back in sync when the looper starts creeping off the drum beat.
I have it plugged straight into my studio PA via stereo, and it sounds AMAZING.  Can't speak to plugging it inline between guitar and guitar amp.
Haven't even begun to play with the software/programming aspect yet, but if it works as advertised I can see how it would be incredibly easy to pre-program your entire set list.  The external footswitch, when no beat is playing, is used to cycle through the current group of songs, so it's very easy to advance to the next song in your set list.
Also finally realized that, when no beat is playing, the Internal pedal can be used to set bpm by stomping... works really great to set the bpm to whatever i'm feeling, before firing up the song.
Love the intros and outros too, makes it very truly "song-like" when I'm performing on the fly.  And the 3 randomized fill patterns keep it incredibly "fresh" and not boring.
In short: What are you waiting for?  If you're looking for a versatile drum machine, this is really the one!!!                
As a bass guitarist, practicing at home can be boring, but this small pedal makes it fun again. It's loaded with rhythms from marching band to jazz all with adjustable bpm's, volume and drum fills. I've even taken it to band practice when the drummer couldn't make it. The drum sounds are authentic, the pedal is built well, it's compact and there's more beer left in the fridge after practice ;)
I had my eye on this for quite sometime and now that I started plating with it, I dont know why I waited so long. This is a great tool that any musician should have if they can afford it ( thanks to zZounds I was able to). It's very easy to use. I was able to figure it out and start jamming within 10 minutes of opening the package. I was drummer and I must say I was very pleased with the sound quality. It doesnt sound artificial or MIDI like. Although nothing beats having a real drummer on hand, the BeatBuddy comes pretty close. The reason I say is because of the control it gives you (fills, accents, stop start).  Some have rated this device low and to be honest I cant see why. At the very least, still device would still rate above average as it pretty much delivers on all it's promises. The only knock is the price otherwise if you are reading this review, there is no reason not to buy it. Very fun to use.                
I love it. Sounds awesome. Not a digital drummer.  Sounds like a real drummer because it is!                
The Beat Buddy drum pedal for guitarists is simply fantastic. Right out of the box it is easy and intuitive to set up and use. I was up and running in minutes. With an array of different drum kit styles and musical patterns you can have your own personal drummer at your feet (don't tell the drummers). The resources for setting up playlists to use at a gig are excellent. You can hook the drum buddy up to your computer and program a list of songs that can be gone through by simply tapping on the footswitch you can purchase along with the drum buddy. A must have accessory. You can control the tempo by foot tapping, switch between sections of a song that have different feels and fills, intro a song, outro a song, pause for dramatic effect, all just using your feet while you play and sing. A really great addition for the performing singer/guitarist. I have a Bose L1 compact PA that really allows the beat buddy to shine with great bass for the kick drum and clear, crystalline highs for cymbals and hi-hat sounds. I can't say enough good things about this great product. Super for practice as well, a metronome on steroids, that sounds natural. You'll probably want to give yours a name.... Ringo works for me.                
However... it has several "glitches" that make it impractical to use in a playing situation.
First, the "songs" all start with a drum solo... incredibly hard to deal with when most songs started by a drummer will have the customary "click off" to begin.
Second, pressing the "change from rhythm A to rhythm B button can be an odd experience as the transitional fill will be forced into whatever beats are left, sometimes really making for an odd sound.
Third, the midi interface works strangely when coupled with another drum machine in as much as the counts tend to drift apart (i.e. 108 beats per minute is NOT the same from machine to machine and becomes very noticeable several minutes into a song when the two beats are off).
Fourth, the "remote" pedal is almost useless (cymbal crash - start/stop the "song") and is not re-programmable as I was told it would be. While it is handy to stop a song with, rather than go though the "drum solo" at the end of each song, it's not really very functional.
Sixth, so far I cannot make the updating software work correctly, and the updated songs I was told would be available, so far aren't (to my knowledge - or then again, maybe I simply can't make the updating software work correctly). Whatever the problem with the update software, or a bad user interface, or a bad user (I'm a guitar player not a computer programmer), I would like to see a bit more user friendly an update mechanism be built.
Last, it's a pedal, which means you have to bend over to fiddle with it to get to the next "song"... which with a guitar is not all that easy to do... the answer to this would be a pedal driven BOARD with the board on a stand and a bank of pedals to control the board, that way between songs simply reach over and change settings rather than trying to keep from banging the neck of the guitar on... anything.
I reiterate that the sound is great (except for the drum solo INTO each "song" and out of each "song") and sounds most like a drum set than any other drum device I've used (I have half a dozen different machine/trigger pads from Roland to Simmons and BOSS and back), but the way the Beat Buddy starts, ends, and performs transitions leaves a little to be desired, especially considering the price.                
This is very cool. Easy to use and so much help with timing !!! Love it !!!                
So far, it works well. I'm impressed with it so far. It has a multitude of rhythms, and styles to aid in writing and/or live performance.                
This thing is Great!  Should have had one years ago.  Beats almost any drum machine out there.  Sounds Great and easy to use.  Would recommend it to anyone.i hat                
Is this an overpriced metronome? Yup, but it's a lot of fun also. Has very good sounding drum loops, as well as being able to customize anything you want. Very versatile.                
it may be ok for the pros, but to normal players its to complex . sound is ok but too much like a fake . the downloads suck and the program is too timley. I personally didn't like it and I have been recording as a hobby for years.                
Sound quality is very good for my purposes of high quality webcasting.                 
I wanted a unit with many channels with compressors to make 
the maximum audio capability easy to set and not have to
supervise. Overdriving digital audio circuits is disastrous
in terms of distortion- much worse than analog systems.                 
Board layout is logical and intuitive.                
This unit offers more bang-for-buck than others I could find in-class.
Compressors & equalizers & phantom for four of the channels does
the job!                 
If the size were a bit smaller, I'd be in heaven but not a big
deal; someday I will likely use the extra capacity available.
My main unrealized preference is for 24-bit USB resolution.
I get around it by plugging into the output XLR a 24-bit converter
instead of the resident 16-bit circuit. Results are strictly
studio-grade audio- as good as it gets.                  
I was looking for a small but powerful mixer and let me tell you!!! This thing is amazing I have Numark NS6 and 15" powered EV'S this mixer makes these things pump and clear.
sound. Would tell any one just started to get into music to get one. I'm extremely satisfied.                 
This is a great small mixer which has several nice features like low freq cutoff, compressors, EQ. It works well and has excellent sound quality for recording. It is a great value for the price.                
It does the job very well and it sounds superb for the price.                
the usb/interface feature makes it stand out from other mixer.. its kinda tricking learning to make the mixers work in software but once you play with it its very easy                
just like anyother mixer i have used                
Made Like aNY oTHER mIXER Ive Had                
Havent Needed It                
Crystal clear vocals! and with logic I can easily tweak tracks with a boat load of effects. When used with the right software and the right know-how you can make a killer record with not much additional equipment                
effects and free software!! also slide controls on a budget mixer?!?!? you wont find that anywhere else.                
For the beginner it MAY be tricky to set up with your software. Try and find someone who knows what their doing to help you with setup                
made from the same stuff any other would be                
best value!! but then again thats Behringers thing right?                
havent had to                
professional look.                
honestly Ill never have to pay for recording again! this mixer keeps on truck'n                
This particular mixer was a "returned" item at zZounds and I bought it from them at a very nice discount because of this.
The mixer is brand new. Not a scratch on it. All functions work perfectly! It's great for a DJ or small band. I'm very happy with it.
By the way, the guys at zZounds are FANTASTIC! They are ALWAYS extremely helpful when I call with my questions and concerns. I trust them with every purchase I make.                
Product is a mixer and it does that real well                
Has many features I needed including the Phantom Power for my condenser mikes.  Have not used it as a interface to my computer yet but I am anxious to try.                  
Very good price for all you get                
Have not dealt with support.                
Over all it is good but the one thing that bugs me is the brightness of the power on light.  I have to cover it with my finger in order to see descriptions of buttons near it.  I think I am going to have to cover with something.                 
For it's sound and price, which sometimes may lead to trepidation in a purchase, I was astounded by the sound this unit expresses.                
I purchased this item for what it offered in the description, it delivered.                
Very simple to use, took a little tweaking when recording through an external tube amp, yet very easy to clean up.                
Recognized how solid the build is on this mixer right out of the box.                
Most definitely, I could have purchased another more expensive however, I wanted to save a few dollars and am not disappointed in my decision.                
Have not needed to contact support.                
I hope it will last, I will always find a use for it although I may look for something else with more options.                
After waiting for about 3 months for a different Behringer Mixer to come in stock, I chose to order this one instead.The problem is, I needed one for recording my guitar covers, nothing vocal.... And I didn't even check to see if this had guitar inputs. It doesn't... by the way ;)ANYWAYS, I still use this thing by using adapters to plug into the 1/8 inch input, and it still sounds awesome with my guitar. Clean, distortion, or whatever effect you need, it will still sound good! I was pretty impressed with this little thing, even after the initial disappointment.. so I can only imagine what it would sound like being used for what it's built for.I recommend it.                
The mixer is got to be the quietest, lowest noise USB mixer out there. Just simply the right size with the right performance.                
I was looking for a USB powered mixer that could work with my Nexus 6 cellphone. I get clean sound and have plenty of gain. This compact 2 track mini mixer has 1/8 " inputs along with phono and XLR. Does a great job!                
this lil thing is junk no matter what you do you will hear all of the channels in the head phones even the channels that are not assigned to go to the head phones you will hear them I did call Behringer and asked them they said that’s how the mixer is and to fix it turn down the volume on the head phones so don’t wast your time or money don’t buy this mixer                
Easy to hook up and set. Clean audio with plenty of power. I put it into my studio which was built in 1962. It replaced a Sony 100 watt receiver which replaced a pair of Macintosh power amps running push pull quad 6L6GC tubes. It's been too long to compare it to the Macintosh amps but it's much cleaner than the Sony was.                
The sound is fairly transparent, I was surprised at its performance.                
It's a power amp! input and output with volume nobs..... The only down side was the lack of banana plug sockets. But i simply added my own to it. messured the actual power output between 120 - 138 watts each channel at 8 ohms, nice!                
Again, its a power amp! 2 volume nobs and a power button!                
Of course being a very low cost item the quality is going to lack in places, but where it does lack in the A500 is mainly in the plastic face plates. Internally the electronics are of fairly good build with, alot of the wiring being of a larger than average gauge and fairly solid looking circuits.                
I work in a high end Hi-Fi audio store, and I can get anything from DENON, Cambridge Audio, NAD, Samson, Alesis at COST PRICE! And I went a boaght this Behringer A500 from another audio store! If that doesn't give you the message of the units value for extremely great performance, then I dont know what will!                
I haven't had to contact behringer on this item so far. But I have dealt with them before in the past for my DDX3216 digital mixer, it had a busted processor and was OUT of warranty and they still fixed it with no charge! So I for one CANNOT trash talk this company for their support, at least their Australian support!
Take that HATERS!                
Id definitely buy another one for my other 2 speakers!                
As I said before, I work in Hi-Fi, I could have gotten any stereo integrated amp from DENON, Cambridge or NAD below cost price. And I found the behringer outperforming all in almost all fronts, sure the Cambridge's are very nice sounding but they simply cannot compete with this for transparency of signal or come anywhere close in power output unless you want to spend 6 times the amount of money you would in buying the behringer.
Product of the YEAR for me!                
I own two which are bridged running my stereo speakers from a pre amp, a close friend has 5 all bridged running his home theater set through a yamaha reciever and it sounds great. So my better than the yamaha amp, much more dynamic. Honestly for $200 it's a good piece of gear. Although it can only really manage 120 watts RMS at 8 ohm for its price it is great value. From the sound of the other reviewers it doesn't handle road use but this is unfair as it was never designed to. For the money great little amp.                 
There are not any stand out features but the fact that you can buy an amp like this for $200 is amzing. The heatsink is large as is the transformer.                
Very easy (come on its a power amp)                
Although i have hear that on some the gain knobs do not line up i have not had any problems. The plastic front plate is cheap as well. Behringer could have done better                
For the money it is amazing, try some audio forums they rave about the amp (for home use)                
Have not had any trouble with this amp but my previous experience with behringer is not at all good, once you buy something they dont care                
I personally like the meters on the front, my friend however has covered the lights as he finds them distracting. The face plate is cheap but still fairly pleasing to the eye, i do really really like the heatsinks on the outside.                
Currently it is providing great power cheaply, unless it dies or i upgrade speakers i cannot see myself replacing it.                
As a solid state amp, it has no sound of its own. That's a good thing.                
Lot's of input flexibility. Has unbalanced RCA inputs which is the only way a home theater guy like me could use it.                
Plug and play. It works great and has tons of power.                
It's well built, but it's not a jewel or anything. It does look cool, however, and the front power/clip meters are pretty nice looking if you're into that sort of thing.                
This amp represents an insane value when you compare it watts per dollar to anything else out there.                
Haven't had any problems so I haven't had to deal with the company.                
If you can call an amp "sexy", I guess this one is.                
This amp is running my power hungry nominal 4-ohm but tremendously power hungry HSU 1220 subwoofer. I have it in bridged mode and it has never clipped, even at insane volumes (114 dbs at 20hz).                
I think your store would be wise to cite the review from The Audio Critic on line magazine.  They tested this amp and gave it a good review based on performance for the money.  Their comments were that for the price it was an excellent value even if it did not produce the rated wattage of 160wpc at 8ohms but rather 120 wpc, it is still hard to beat.
The negative comments I see listed hear sound like they are based on someone who is used to tube amps which do things to sound that are good for performance but bad for playback, asuming what you want is inaudible distortion.                
The review I mentioned cites some lackluster connections but then again it's a very low priced amp that if someone used in a fixed location and didn't have to use it on the road, it would have no problem.
I plan to get one just to play with and perhaps use to power a subwoofer in the bridged mono mode, or give to my son for use with with an old preamp/tuner that I no longer need.  Solid State amplifiers like this one should have no "sound" of their own, but rather should pass a signal without audibly altering it, if it does that, and there's no measured data that indicates otherwise, it is one helluva bargain.  If you want something you can use on the road, get a QSC, they can take a beating.  If you just need some stable power for a home studio, the Behringer will be perfect.                
I think the sound is fine in terms of not coloring it, but it's not as loud as the power rating would have you believe.                  
What do you expect out of something in this price range?                 
It doesn't get much easier, but then again, it's just a power amp.                
This thing is a piece of crap.  Don't but it.  I know it's not designed for the road, but it doesn't hold up to being used either.  I bought two of these and had problems with both of them.  One had the volume potentiometers replaced and I'm still trying to get service on the other one.  If you want to buy Behringer, spring for the EP1500 or 2500.  I love my EP2500, but these are garbage.                 
Good features for a low price is a nice idea, but not if the product does not work AND you have to go through hell and a LOT of downtime to get support on it.  If this crap breaks (it will) and you pay shipping to have it fixed, you may as well pay more for a better amp and save the  trouble.                
This company sucks horribly for support.  If you don't buy from a local store who stocks the product, you're screwed.  They are extremely slow to do anything.  When my first one broke, it took over a month to fix because they didn't have the part.  With this one, I have a hell of a time trying to get anyone to respond to me.  All I'm trying to do is get an RA number for service.  I sent the e-mail with the required info 7 days ago and have still no response.  I called them before to start the process and they said they'd e-mail the form... never happened.  Unless you buy from a local store, do not buy from this company.                
I think it looks pretty cool.  You can plug something into it just to make the lights look pretty, as long as you don't need it to power speakers or anything like that.                
I have replaced these with one EP2500.  The only reason I bought that one was because of all the great reviews.  I have one A500 in my rack as a "back-up" in case the EP2500 fails and I have another A500 that's broken.  I might see about selling them on E-Bay or maybe using them in something non-critical like powering monitors at band practice, hooking up a cd player, or using them as door stops.                
Just an average sound, not great but not trash either.                
Had features you would expect from an amp except only 1 year warranty where other companies offer 2-3 year. They must know something we don't.                
It's an amp                
After 1 1/2 years and only 322 hours of home recording time, one of the channels blew.                
There are better deals out there in performance, value and durability.                
Beringer made every attempt to get out of making repairs claiming improper use and ignorance of its purpose and use.                
I wouldn't give 2 cents to anyone for this product                
After doing the Warranty Waltz with Beringer and burying my poor amp yesterday, I've decided to replace the other Beringer unit I own ASAP.                
This thing couldn't produce good sound if i hired an orchestra to play behind it!!! It is junk!! Hollow,empty sounding amp,not reliable,and the power rating says stereo 223 watts per side, its more like 23 watts per side, very hollow sounding, no brilliance, or warm tones here!!!This thing wouldn't know warm if i gave it a jacket!!ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL!!!                
It features no power or anything else exciting!!!!!!                
Theres no ease of use when its not reliable or powerful!!                
J-U-N-K Can it be spelled any clearer?                
No value in a product that doesn't do what it says it will,and, a company [behringer who doesn't give a crap]!!!                
Behringer cant answer any questions and doesn't return e-mails or phone calls!! HMMMMM..... I wonder why im returning this amp to the store [ online ] that i purchased it at!!! Behringer got my money, thats all they care about.... to heck with the consumer is what im getting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
I dont want it,you dont want it, nobody wants it!!!!!!!!!! Trust me from one musician to another!!!                
One horribly bad product,and,a company[ behringer ]thats terrible!                
Some say this amp sounds clean, but what is described as "clean" are distortions in the higher frequencies. A studio reference amp should sound clean and neutral. The A500 does not.                
It has also cinch (phono) inputs, that's great,but what do these help if the sound is as bad as described above. Also the wattage is overstated. It delivers 138 Watts at 8 Ohms in stereo mode, not 160 Watts as described by Behringer                
As any power amp. Turn down volume while switching on or off                
Its kind of "plasticy" Also on the A-500 I used one channel was slightly louder than the other one, of course with both volume knobs at the same setting.Its typical Behringer quality. Do not buy this if you want quality                
Although it seems cheap, this amp is of no value.                
They want you to sell their products, also make false promises, wrong wattage figures etc, They state this amp is pro, not it is not.
After you have bought their product they dont want to hear from you again. Support is terrible                
If I want it, thanks, but no thanks                
Don't waste your money                
sounds very natural, plugged 2 different AE guitars, nice sound for each...also tried mic channel and it sounds great as well, tried reverb with harmonica, think I will continue to use that live....                
love that it includes a foot pedal..very handy                
very simple to figure out and I'm usually a little lost with electronics                
knobs are a little small and fragile seeming and a cover would be nice but that's my only concern                
really great prices on all Behringer products                
not used just got it a few weeks ago                
great looking                
I would replace with same                 
This amp has fantastic sound.  It has near perfect acoustic reproduction. I play my Ovation through it, and the sound is warm, full and rich.  There is no amp hum or anything.  It also does wonders for my voice, which is saying quite a bit.  The 180 watts is provides plenty of volume, whether alone or with a band.  The stereo amp fills a room from front to back, and is not too loud or soft anywhere.  Put it on an amp stand to elevate and tilt it for the best sound.                
Lots of features.  The equalizer is great and the FBQ works well.  I really like the built in effects.  The room, hall and concert reverb are very nice and very natural.  They enhance the sound without being overdone.  The other effects also sound pretty good, though I'm not sure how often one would use flange or phaser on an acoustic instrument.  Again, they are noticeable but not overdone.  All sorts of jacks for input and output.  Loved that they included a foot switch so I don't have to buy one later, and it is metal and well made too.                
Very simple to operate.  The manual is straight forward, and you don't have to memorize all the effects numbers, as they are listed right on the amp.  I was able to go from full, natural acoustics to some twangy blue grass in no time at all.                  
Seems pretty solid and well made.  Hefty feel and solid construction.  Good protection on the corners.  However, the knobs do feel a little cheap and plastic, like they could be knocked off pretty easily if banged around in a trailer or something too much.  This is probably the only area where I fault the amp.  But I tend to baby my equipment, so no real problem for me.                
Hard to beat.  Great sound, great features, lots of wattage, and a reasonable price.                
Only had it a month, so I haven't needed any support yet.  However, I did contact Behringer with some pre-sale questions.  They responded quickly and were very helpful with my questions.                
Amp has a nice look.  Sort of retro, though the equalizers take away from this. Overall, pretty cool looking.                
Had this a month now and am very happy.  I play with a small country group every now and then, and wanted something for voice and my acoustic without bring a whole PA system along.  This fits the bill nicely, and the sound is great.  This is my first amp from Behringer, and I would certainly buy from them again.                  
I bought this amp online without trying it.   The low price, abundance of features, looks and wattage attracted me to the amp.
When I fired it up I was very disappointed.  The first thing that concerned me is that I had to set the volume on my guitar all the way up, crank the Master volume and gain on the amp  past 9 and that only obtained  about 85db of sound from a few feet away.  The amp is not loud enough for my living room so I would never attempt to use it at a live performance.  
The sound quality was poor to say the least.   Even  with each  channel having it's own eq I could not get the sound dialed in anywhere close to being acceptable for professional applications.  The best I could do was get an OK sound from the acoustic guitar.  I tried using several mics including the industry standard  a Sure 58. I spent a great deal of time trying to get a decent warm sound from the vocal channel but it wasn't going to happen.                  
The amp has a lot of features which is part of what drew me towards it.  However, the quality of the eq, compressor, and effects were not very good.                  
Great looking amp, and well built cabnit.   The knobs are not the highest quality.                
Astatically it's a good looking amp.   Lots of features but they didn't help obtaining a good sound.                
I am sorry to say that I was very dissatisfied and returned the amp for a refund.  I would only recommend this amp as a starter amp                
One word: AWESOME........                
Brought this amp due the fact that had the ACX 1000 which blew up, and foolishly thought this would be as good, WOW no where near it , I use a Australian made maton acoustic Guitar which is world class, through this amp it sound world crap, no richness sounds like a transistor radio, Disapointed YES! very! Will be getting the old one fixed!!!! This is my experience and my personal opinion only.                
I bought this amp about six months ago from zzounds and i just started to use it this past weekend i thought the sound was pretty bad on the guitar and vocals not sure what to do but i will try playing through it again this weekend and see                 
It has no nice clean sound for the guitar and the vocal part has no reverb                 
it may need a lot of tweeking to get a good sound from but i dont want to spend hours twiddling knobs                 
sturdy construction and easy to move around                 
if i can sort the sound out its worth the money if not $200 to much                
there's a long phone call waiting to happen :-(                
looks good nice and neat                 
if i can sort the sound issues i will have to look for something new a.s.a.p                
The sound is good for 2 x 8" of these special Bugera speakers the Back is fully enclosed which is a plus for pushing the amp beside you or behide. I experimented in the studio. and Found I could Play with the amp on a stand facing me with the guitar and mic plugged in with effects and with good volume to practice and not feed back using the feedback control. Out front I could get enough volume to play a coffee house with the amp alone using the amp for the PA also. small , light weight and with separate effects for vocals and a foot pedal to control each makes it a snap! The range and dept of the effects were far more reaching that I expected. The back of the amp has plenty of pedal inputs and send plugs for recording DI's and such.                 
The foot switch is METAL tough and with about 18feet of good cable. 
All the features is what you will and should be looking for in an acoustic guitar especially the antifeedback control if you use harp it would be a great tool although most harp players use tube amps, they could use a pedal to boost it and use the effects for a better sound.                 
It is so easy I just cut the little picture out of the sound effects and put it on my stand every thing else it intuitive. 
a 5th grader could use it. It takes longer to unbox it that it does to connect it and use it.                 
Good quality Look. metal corner protecters, covering looks good.
For the price you would have to go about 600 green backs in a major brand and I trialed those and the speakers are really back. The speakers in this amp does not  load up with the bass and flap out. 
It can take the power.                 
Value packed as far as I am concerned, I been playing 44 years. 
I use all types of equipment from vintage tube to  so good stuff.                
Not yet, but I've been using the Behringer 60 watt bass amp in my studio for 5 years and it gets used for Key boards and bass a lot, no issues.                 
Based on the way the product looks it has great look and I am not ashamed to put it on stage like some of the Black mechanical techno. Bolt edged looking junk. 
It has a nice eye appeal.                 
I will use it and recommend it , get another for a back up if it gets on the road.                 
I've wanted a behringer amp for quite a few years. I recently made a trip to R.I. and looked at another brand and was dissapointed. I came home and found the behringer ACX900 online, and bought it. I have never been more pleased with the sound and the effect sections with any other amp (Fender, Marshall, etc.). The bang for my buck was huge! Beyond a doubt, the best acoustic amp I've ever played through. I use a multi effect stomp box on one channel and on the other I use a staight jack and can get four different sounds with one guitar. It's really cool!                
The amp comes with a two button controller with a very long cord. It's all the amp needs.                
Haven't had any probs yet. But registration and email corresponces were quick.                 
A friend of mine thought it was an old amp that really sounded great. WhenI told him it was brand new, he didn't believe me and I had to show him the invoice. It has a brown vinyl cover that looks like aged leather.                
Many years! I do want to get a couple of cabs to expand the stereo effect. I mainly bought it because the price was too low . The unit was marked down due to cosmetics. I haven't seen any blemishes at all. If stolen, I would replace it wit the same model. I haven't gone all the way with this amp to say what I don't like yet, give me a couple years. Ha! Ha!                
I found the sound of this amp very clean, clear and natural. The sound quality is simply superb if you are using this amp for acoustic guitars & I even used it for my 12-stirng guitar with a Seymour Duncan Woody pickup arrangement & it sound brilliant. The on board effects are again very impressive & I like especially the Reverb, Delay & Chorus effects a lot. The Flange & Tremolo effects are slighly weak but I never used them as these are probably not being widely used for acoustic instruments. The reverb effects are one of the best I ever listened, you can say the quality seems equal to Boss RV-5. Delay effects are very useable and very natural and short-delays respond very well with your playing. Chorus effect is very lush and powerful. I played my guitar by switching off all the effects and it sounds very natural without any noise. I used it in some live situations & i found it very good. Equalizer is again very effective for shaping your desirable sound. The output power is quite enough for small size live situations but you can hook it up with a PA mixer with all the necessary connections available at its back panel which is a great plus point of this amp. I think if you really want to enjoy with the full potential of this amplifier then you should use a good quality electric acoustic guitar like I am using the Ovation Celebrity CS-257. You should better place it in a tilted position for better sound projection to audience.                
This amp comes with a very well made foot switch. This amp is full of features and I personally like the Feedback detection & Reverb/Chours/Delay features very much. The design & overall look of this amp is very impressive and looks like a very expensive amplifier. The vinyl covering color is very pleasing and looks a lot like pure leather. The golden color front & rear panels & protective corners are again very cool features indeed. Yes I do agree that the volume knobs looks a little weak.                
Very easy amplifier as far its operation is concerned. The operating manual is very well printed and mentioned all the necessary points and details. I have used four different guitars on this amp and its responds very well even with a solid body electric guitar.                
The manufacturing quality is again very good. I did not like the noise it produces while switching off the amp. One or two equalizer's sliders LCD sometime start to flicker and by tapping lightly they become okay. Apart from these two minor faults all is very well made. I think this amp is cosmetic wise is superb but a little sensitive as far as sturdiness is concerned. However I am a very keen care taker of my equipment so no problem for me.                
I found this amplfier very worthful.                
I have a chance to dealt with the company. Two years back I was trying to book this amp with their authorized dealer in Pakistan but the dealer was not booking the order and playing tricks with me. So I reported Behringer sales department and they verified my complaint reports and put observaiton on the dealer. On verification, they finally kicked out the unscrupulous dealer from their list and arranged a supplier for me in my country to supply my desired equipments. Now I am proud to say that I and one friend of mine is now the owners of their Ultracoustic amplifiers only with the kind help from Behringer Sales team.                  
This is one of the sexiest amplifier I have ever seen. Very beautifully made. It has a very aesthetic touch and finishing is just superb. The different parts color scheme is matchless and I simply fell in love with this amplifier. My friends are crazy with the brilliant looks of this amp. Futhermore its LCD red color lights are like diamonds glowing on a chunk of gold. Simply superb.                 
Overall this amp is a great addition to my gears rig. No I would never replace it as it completely fulfills my requirements. If this amp is stolen I would buy it again but I will select the higher model because probably I want more power. I like most about it is the beautiful design & sound quality. There is nothing whatsoever in it to my least liking.                
Smooth, rich, full bodied, like a great cup of coffee!  Very satisfying.  I tried out Fender, Hartke, Roland, Marshall, and Behringer.  The Behringer was the most bang for the buck.  It does not feedback.  It is clean if you want it and down and dirty if you want that.  Solid, well made.  Comes with metal dual control footswitch.  The fx are there and all have perceptable differences.  You will thoroughly enjoy this amp.  I use it in my bedroom only, but it is rugged enough to take on the road.                 
Dual Purpose metal well made stays where you put it foot switch.                
Dial up your sound in a flash.                
Very nice solid construction.  Not flimsy in the least.  Good Speakers.                
I did a lot of research and I don't think you can buy more amp for the money.                
Have not needed it.                  
Looks as good as a speckled pup under the hen house!                
Seems like it will last as long as my 24 year old Stereo Chorus 400.                
Great amp. I was going to replace my guitar until I put it through this amp. Great sound!                
ZZounds is a great site.  The product was exactly as described and shipped in less time than expected.  I am very satisfied with this product and their service.                
This amp/Pa system is simply amazing ! The sound is pure candy to the ears. I've used it to play small/medium size venues and it performed admirably. I hook a DigiTech Jamman Stereo pedal up to it into the CD inputs with pre-recorded backing tracks that I play my guitar and sing along with so I'm like a one man band. It's great!!!!!                
Is a good amp. Plays nicely for coffee houses... I haven't tried it hooked up to a pa yet. I have a nice shure mic that it plays well with and of course a Martin Guitar doesn't hurt.                
Just got this thru zZounds. The service was great. Im not happy with the amp. To thin sounding, The effects lack so much. Ive had many different types of accoustic amps, I do not recommend this one. I play professionally 3 times a week. I'll keep this and get another later, One good thing my Strat sounds pretty good thru it. My Ovation lacks tho. But  love zZounds.
I owned a ACX 1000 behringer before this, and the 1800 is so much better, it's like night & day.  Behringer really did a good job of taking out the noise which was the big complaint of the ACX1000.
The sound is so much cleaner.                
Too early to tell about reliability, but it sure is pertty.                
You can get much more expensive acoustic amps, but dollar for dollar it's the best I've heard.                
Sound clearity is OK.  
The Volume is good enough to cover mid size hall.                  
Multi Foot pedal is ok. 
Effect Knob is not good at all.  You turned it, but you don't feel where it select.                  
If you are not stupid, you can do it.                  
Worst quality I have ever experienced.  
The reason why I purchased this because it has second channel with mic xlr.  The second channel gain control is crapped out within couple of months.                   
Sound and its volume is ok.
Quality and its support is crap.  
mini mini moni mo~                
If you are a low tempo guy/gal, probably you can deal with it.  
However, if you are not, this company has crappy support. 
I called for warranty repair, they said I have to do it on-line.  
I did on-line submission for the warranty repair, I have to wait 48 hours, and I am still waiting.  
Oh, one more thing, if you want to call to resolve to problem, good luck~!.  They said they only have two person avavilable for dealing customer warranty, and it looks like they are getting lots of calls for bad product.                  
I only have limited experience with the older revision of this product (the ADA8000) but this is definitely an improvement.  The older version had less capable mic preamps, not quite as much dynamic range, and issues with the converters clocking properly with certain interfaces.  The ADA8200 has improvements in all of these areas.  The mic preamps certainly don't have as much clean gain as my Focusrite ISA Ones or my Seventh Circle Audio pres, but they are still have enough gain to push a Shure SM7 to line level without any appreciable noise.
Some people are deterred by the inability to use S/MUX for higher sample rates, but this isn't an issue for me.  I never record anything above 44.1 or 48khz.  I bought two ADA8200s here on Zzounds at a B-Stock/Blemished item price of $150 each!  That is a truly unbeatable price for getting 16 mic preamps and 16 A/D/D/A.  I use them with a MOTU 828mk3 with no issues thus far.  
If you are looking for the cheapest route to expand the number of channels in your project studio rig, look no further!  The sound quality is on par with any of the more expensive alternatives like the Focusrite Octopre, M Audio Octane, Presonus Digimax, etc.  My only issue with the unit is having so many of the connections on the front.  I have them permenantly interfaced with a patchbay so each unit has 16 cables and connectors hanging out on the front of the rack and it can sometimes be difficult to adjust the levels for the mic pres.  Its a small price to pay in terms of ease of use considering how great of a value it is!                
I bought this to get 8 more channels into my home ProTools rig. I'm currently using a 002 which is about ten years old, so I'm pretty sure the pres and converters on the Behringer are actually better than what I've been using. 
The unit is pretty straightforward – no elaborate bells and whistles, just gain and phantom, really. There's a weird jump in level towards the top end of the gain range, but the unit doesn't have the same noise as its predecessor with the gain cranked up that high. This isn't a set of pres that impart any coloration or character; it's just a clean extra 8 channels. 
One quibble I have is with the phantom power button – it's illuminated green in its "off" state and red in its "on" state. This is, for some reason, counterintuitive for me and I've been fooled by it once or twice in stressed setup situations. I'd have preferred no illumination in the "off" position and green for "on." But I'll get used to it.
As this is one of the more modestly-priced 8-channel pres with ADAT/opto connection on the market, I suspect there are some out there with nicer pres and converters. But working on a budget as I am, this one gives me results that I'm happy with – and my clients are happy too. Win-win.                
I use the Focusrite Octopre MkII dynamic preamps on my primary rig, but I needed a cheap 8 channel mic pre for a rehearsal rig. The mic preamps are clean, but perhaps a bit harsh in the upper end and they do not have the depth and body of the Focusrite, but then again... huge price difference.                
Well, I must say I am impressed with this unit.  While it's build quality doesn't seem super robust, it has the exact same AD converters as the Focusrite Saffire and Scarlett interfaces.  The Cirrus Logic CS4272 chipset.  The preamps sound a little more flat and true on this unit compared to my Focusrite which sounds more boomy and big.  
I could see this easily fitting into the mix.  Very good job Behringer!                
Great price and value now with the Midas touch.                
Works as it should.  Seems well made, sounds good.  What more can you say??  Buy it!                
Make my guitar sound great.                
I haven't had much use for the mid-frequency knob, pad switch, or ground switch. The level, blend, and equalizer knobs are pretty much set where I want them now.                
It took some experimentation to get the settings right.                
It seems well made and durable. Only time will tell.                
Compared to other pre-amp/DIs, this was a good value.                
If I hadn't needed a pre-amp for my passive pickup, I wouldn't have looked at it.                
I don't expect to need to replace it, unless it were lost or stolen.                
Great acoustic di. Excellent price. Stereo ins and outs                
This item was defective shortly after receiving it.  Returned it to the company at my expense for repair or replacement under the warranty.  5 months later it is clear they have no intention of doing either.  Others have had a similar experience.  Stay away from Behringer!!                  
I bought this hoping to add a little "richness" to the sound of my acoustic, but instead it added unwanted noise. I tried multiple cables and configurations and power sources but I was not able to eliminate the "humming" noise. It may be a defective unit, not sure. It's on my desk right now packaged to be sent back. BIG PROPS to zZounds for issuing me an RMA and paying the return shipping with no questions asked.                
I wouldn't use this with headphones to mix or master; there is some noticeable noise added which is typical of almost any headphone amp, but this doesn't really matter to me because I only use this for live tracking. There are amps much more expensive yet with much more noise. I use a higher quality headphone output on my digi 002 for reference when mixing/mastering.
Plenty of power. Just as much as my digi 002, but this amp doesn't sound quite as good.                
Plenty of inputs/outputs. More than I will ever need.                
Not a very detailed manual, so setup could potentially be confusing for some people. Actually, I did receive a very extensive manual, but it was in German (I think) and I didn't get an english one. Oh well. I don't personally need one anyway.                
It's fairly light, but doesn't necessarily feel cheap. It could probably take a beating. Overall well built and the sound quality, for live tracking, is just fine.                
$45 with shipping? Really freaking good deal. I prefer this amp to many that are much more expensive.                
Never dealt with behringer and I own a lot of their gear. This is a good thing. Their speakers aren't too good, so I avoid them. Their electronics/rack gear/mixers are generally fantastic.                
Anyone needing a reliable, well built, good sounding headphone amp won't be disappointed with this one. Looks snazzy.                
Love it. Will keep it with me for year to come; hopefully it won't go out on me. I don't think it will. Behringer electronics are usually fantastic and very affordable.                 
I am amazed at the sound quality of this little guy. It's clean, clear and produces no noise at all. I am using it with a drum practice rig and my Aural Exciter sounds awesome through it.                
This amp has everything you will need to monitor or use instead of amps and speakers. I use it at the end of the chain and all my effects sound like your playing live. besides the front 4 headphone inputs, you have 4 more on the back sharing the volume control of the front 4. That's 8 total headphone inputs! It also has balanced inputs/outputs and a link connection for other boxes in the series. For monitoring or live practice it's absolutely perfect!                
It's as simple as it gets. There is no learning curve as everything is straight forward. You have front level and output controls that are a cinch to set. Turn your headphone level up and your rocking. That simple.                
This is the only section I can't answer yet as I just got it. I have no idea how long it will last. Switch's, knobs etc are tight, but not the absolute highest quality. This thing might work for years though. It has a plastic housing and great looking LED's and level indicators.                
There is no better value in the catalog. Pristine sound, awesome inputs and levels for $50 bucks shipped? You gotta be crazy not to get it.                
not had to use it.                
Not as sexy as some, but dynamite comes in small packages. The only complaint I have is there is no rack mount capabilities on this little guy, but he sits on top of my effects rack just fine. It does have rubber strips so it wont move.                
I will use it till it breaks. I can't see why I would need anything different. I would replace it in a second as long as there are no quality concerns in the model.                
Ive never owned a different headphone amp.
But I cannot tell that I am having any sound problems with it.
I have a decent set of headphones and it cranks them pretty hard and it sounds clean.                 
Seems to have nice features, 2 inputs to select from.  Works fine for me.                
Really easy to hook up and use.                 
It is plastic but what do you expect for 50 bucks, and it works fine.                
For the money, you likley wouldnt buy a better new headphone amp. 
It does what it says its going too.  Ant the sound is good.                
The best, the kind you dont need                
Looks pretty good in my rack, and level indicators look cool too.                
Overall sound is clean and has plenty of power and options for me.  
4 people can monitor at the same time.  For the money what else can you ask for.                
We got this item to use in the control room so others could hear the headphone mix while the Eng was mixing, works perfectly, not the strongest thing built, but worth the price.                
I use this amp for sports coverage in the field.  It works as advertised.  Hard to beat it for the price.  In my application, equipment take a beating, and this AMP 800 stands up quite well.                
I'm using it as a distribution amp for sound systems in each room. I have a studio and seperate systems where you could monitor the sound from the living room to the garage and bathroom. This was the perfect answer... and it only cost $45 with shipping.                
It elimiated all the ground loops I was chasing and strengthens the sound. I realize this wasn't intended for such a task, but computer speakers mesh with headphone outs, so I can use a JBL system in one room, Cambridge in another and HK in the third. All sound excellent. Controls are wonderful and the balancing input volumes are a welcome addition.                
Brand new condition. It won't stay that way as it will sit behind the wall.                
DA's don't normally cost $45, unless it's some transistor model you scrounged from an old radio station.                 
First Behringer unit. I got their catalog so I'll start the wish list soon.                
Doubt anyone thought of using this as a DA. Typical solution for my problem would be a Symetrix unit for roughly $400-500. More user friendly than a Henry unit.                
It's been on line for a week. Let's see how it holds up during thunderstorm season.                
I bought this headphone amp a while back and right when I got it out of the box only one port worked. When I plugged up my music to listen to through the AMP800 I could only hear it on the left side on port 1. None of the other ports worked at all!! Sweetwater helped out to trade AMP800 and get the ART headphone amp! Save your money and go for the ART headphone amp! It's the best one to use ever!!!                 
Not to bad for 50$ its better then the more expesive ones                
it has 8 outputs like wow i never would need that many but its cool                 
a dof could do it                
its made of plastic but other then that its sex                
never need it                
i got it in canada its is a great add on looks are ok and its sound like sex in my ears i would never buy a expensive one i had a expesive h phone amp and it crapped out after a year and it didnt souund all that pretty this one is soooooo much better                
I had just purchased a used Dobro from a gentleman and he called me the next day and told me about this amp. He has played for 50 years and he thought it might be a good buy. I purchased it and didnt even know what I was looking for, but have to say it makes my resophonic sound of quality that I am really impressed with. Sound is great and even plugging in the mike while playing was great. I have to say I am very very happy with this unit. I am a newbie at this, but I am an old man and know what sounds good.                 
Everything I tried was great                
I dont know what interface intuitive is, but it sounds great.                
Good looking quality cabinet to me.                
I paid $69.00 for this and was thinking about buying a used one for $89.00 This was a much better buy.                
It is an amp, what does sex appeal have to do with a square box sitting on a table.                 
I will have to wait and see                
The sound of this Amp is fine. You dont have any efx but you know that when you buy it. It is a great small amp for practice or could even be used for small gigs.I have ran a small reverb unit on the Mic and it sounds great.Th guitar side is very easy to zoom in if you have a decent preamp on your guitar.                
The Low-Mid-High Eq work exceptionaly well on this unit. but they work simualtanesley on both channels.                
Plug in tweek EQ and Play.                
This amp is made very well. And for the price the quality is great.                
You can not go wrong with this amp, if you are looking for a small pratice amp or something to just sit around the house to pick and sing on. The quality of this amp is the same quality as amps costing 5 times as much. I have only bought a few Behringer products, but everyone I bought was worth what I paid for them. If you are looking for a $600.00 amp sound then buy a $600.00 amp. But this amp is as good as a lot of amps in the $150.00 to $250.00 price range.                
Never needed                
Bought the Behringer AT108 Ultracoustic Acoustic Guitar Amplifier (15 Watts 8) to match up with my new Martin. Not a professional for sure so was looking for something small that I could lug around. This amp is perfect. The sound is great and more powerful than I would have guessed.                
I use this for Ukulele(s) both acoustic and electric. The sound is surprisingly clean compared to my Vox Mini 5 with much less amp noise. I use a Hall of Fame Reverb pedal with it and get some really sweet sounds. I highly recommend this amp. Just wish it was also battery powered.                
I'm an oldie just learning the guitar, but this amp really sounds good. I did some listening at my local music store and in my opinion, the Beringer AT108 Acoustic Guitar Amp sounds as good or even better than those costing 2 or 3 times as much. Ir's a MUST BUY if your in the market for a small amp.
W Drees                
I haven't had a need for support as yet.                
Excellent sound. Very portable. Great sound.                
Microphone sounds very good, I am not dissappointed at all. I would highly reccomend this microphone especially for the price. I recorded my son playing our upright piano and I am very happy with the sound. The recording was comparable to piano CD's we have. For those people who are interested I placed two microphones (the ones I am reviewing) near the back of the piano. The recording and sound was pretty clean, especially considering it was a home recording). I wanted and was able to capture a pretty "clean" sound, from this point one can add reverb to replicate different hall effects if I desire.                
The feature set for this microphone is absolutely the best and of high quality. The shock mount is impressive as well as the microphone carrying case.                
Very good quality all around. The microphone itself has a nice heavy solid feel. It is also nice to look at. Everything about this microphone including the accesories gives one a quality feel.                
I shopped around for microphones, compared specifications, look at the functionality, looked at accessories as well as read reviews. There is no other microphone you can touoh for this price given all of the above. I  bought two and may buy two more.                
I haven't dealt with the company yet, but I am giving them the benefit of the doubt, there should be a NA rating along with the 1 to 10 rating. The instruction booklet should give more information/pictures in how to use the shock mount as well as explaining that there is a 3/8" brass adapter which needs to be removed to fit the standard 5/8" microphone mount.                
Aesthetically this is a very appealing microphone. The foam head accessorie is a bit large, brings some chuckels but isn't unattractive. Besides the microphone all the accesories have an appealing and quality look and feel to them as well. Before I even opened up the microphone case my wife saw the microphone case and was impressed with the case design. One nice thing about this design is that it is unique enough that people will identify with it quickly.                
If one is interested in recording I would absolutely reccomend this microphone. One thing I would suggest is to buy 30' of XLR cable, I bought 20' thinking it would be enough and I am about 10' short. My reccomendation would be to buy one 20' XLR cable and one 10' XLR cable per microphone. The enviroment I am in is home recording.                
Amazing sound for the price, sold my Neumann TLM 103 after comparing with the B-1.                 
A hard case, windscreen and shockmount on a mic at this price point is unheard of.                 
Overall quite good but the same fit and finish of a Neumann, it's more comparable to a Rode NT-2 (at 1/3 the price).                
For the money amazing.  If there is anything that can beat it at three times the price I'd be shocked.                 
Very cool, makes vocals sound alive.                
Couldn't ask for anything more.                
Have only used SM57's previously and am not an experienced recordist, but this bugger sounds great to me.  Sound is clear and airy and "right there" instead of lurking off in the far corners somewhere -- no hint of the muddy dark tone that always plagued me before.                
Has bass rolloff and an attentuation pad, which do their job.  Included shockmount is really high quality -- all metal and convenient to use.  Case is surprisingly good.  Foam spitguard is odd-looking but effective.
Those complaining of the thread adapter: LOOK AGAIN!  There is a brass 3/8 adapter screwed in.  Remove it to find 5/8-27 threads!                
Nice construction, every part smooth, strong and well-fitted.                
I am finding it hard to believe something so nice is priced so reasonably.  Very much worth the price.                
Haven't broken it yet, no experience with factory support.                
Professional-looking.  Studio now looks like I may know what I'm doing.                
I suspect in 3 years I will know more about mics and be able to see the usefulness of an expensive one.  But this should always find some sort of use, even so.  I dig its sound on vocals and tenor saxophone; I might even sing some, now that the B1 makes me sound so much better.  If it's ever lost, I'd go for another one immediately.                
I only had a Nady, a Radio Shack microphone and a Shure SM 57 so it seemed quite an improvement.  I use it with a Yamaha mixer with phantom power.  I now have a Rode K2 which costs almost 7 times as much and the Rode sounds a bit better, but not 7 times as much.                 
It comes with a high quality case and a very nice shock mount. It also has bass rolloff and an attenuation pad.                  
It does not require any learning curve.                
Very solid, bullet-proof.                
Excellent value.                
Never needed support.                
It is for people that want a good condensor microphone at a very low price.                
I still use it although I have a much more expensive microphone.                
The description and reviews I read before purchasing this product are accurate. I was a little skeptical, however this mic does really perform well, and it is true that you won't really need to equalize your recordings. Very low noise, crisp clean recordings!                 
The sound quality of this microphone is pretty good. I bought it around 2003 and I still use it till this day. I use it to record hip hop and r&b music and I have had no one complain about the sound yet. Most are actually surprised that such a cheap mic can sound this good. I know it may not beat out your top brand microphones and I will admit I have not tuned my ear to know the difference between all the famous mics, but this microphone is a must have.                
It comes with everything you need to put the microphone on a stand and start recording. It has a roll of which is useful if you live in urban areas like I do. It help by keeping the lower frequency sounds from entering your mix.                
You plug it in and go, it does what a condeser mic should do.                
The quality is par none, especially for the price. I will always keep one of these around just because its so good yet if someone drops it I know it will last and if not its easy to replace. I have traveled to many cities with it outside of its case and it has not changed the sound one bit. Very sturdy.                
I feel as if I have gotten my moneys worth and so much more. I love this microphone and I am only recently updating to different mics in my home studio. This is perfect for people with a budget that want to just get some work done.                 
Never needed to call. I heard they are slow to respond but hey, your not paying for support with these products you are paying for the product only. If you are worried about getting support I suggest going with a company that builds that into there product price.                
IT looks like a nice microphone and could sit on the same shelf as your high end mics and unless someone saw the Behringer label, they would not think twice about it.                
This mic provides excellent sound quality comparable with much more expensive microphones. It does a great job of picking up the subtle sounds of the violins and violas I have recorded with it.  The low frequency cutoff is a nice addition to this mic.                
this mike fools everyone                
case, shock mount and wind screen included                
all I can say is its sweet looking, and appears to be built to last                
like I said before everyone who hears the takes think I'm using something much much more costly                
never had to call them!!!                
i dont know about "sex appeal" but it is indespensible at this point                
not only would I replace it I'm going to buy a B2 as soon as I can                
Great sound. The presence boost is most welcome on vocals. In most cases it doesn't need any eq at all. Clear and transparent (but with a nice punch!).                
The filters (on the mic) are very useful. If you switch the "-10db" filter on, you can probably even use the B1 on stage! The little metalic case is most stylish and the handle is top notch too.                
Heavy, stylish, good.                
An amazing micro almost for free! What else do you want?                
Didn't need it yet. But, with so many products and retailers, it must be good, yes?                
Very cool. The girls stare at it and want to touch it. (lol)                
If it ever breaks (hope not), I'll buy another B1 just like it.                
I also own a Shure 55H Classic Dynamic Mic which retailed for around $160, this sounds 5x's better than this, with the exception of this being a condenser mic tho. Sound was "there", very clean and crisp, extremely low noise, I believe I didn't hear no noise at all! I use on vocals only, with the addition of a Presonus Preamp... Very rich sounding.                
Features are good for the price, I mean its mike, they only have a few features if any.                
Very cleanly made, durable construction.. Spidermount very solid as well..                
Worth every penny, works well for home recording hobbyists or musicians.                
I called Behringer 3x's to ask them about one of their mixers, very friendly and helpful, sounds like they know what their doing.                
Overall, this product fits my needs nicely, might search for another condenser mic soon, just to have a few in my home studio... Very much worth its weight in gold.                
It sounds ok, the mic does what it has to do and gets the job done for the price.  Its not up to par with other mics that cost just a few bucks more.  The only problem I really have, is it really seems i have to crank the Pre to get it cookin.                
It has some cool extras, not top notch but if you are an at home musician or hobbyist there is no reason you need a whole lot more.                
Its a Mic, you plug it in, turn on phantom and use it.                
I like this mic fair enough, although, if i lost it i would probably go for a slightly better mic.  Still, i wont deny that it makes a good introductory mic.                
Its a hundred bucks. It records.  As i said before though, if it broke i would probably get a slightly better mic and spend a few more bucks.                
Never had to use it.                
it looks nice, but the beringer logo on the side tells people its cheap.                
I think the mic is ok.  I only gave it a higher rating because I believe that it makes a good beginner mic.  Once you become a little more serious and noticing little things in your recordings this mic may not cut it.
Oh and i do industrial so distortion doesnt really bother me.  The fact that i have to crank this thing to hear it however does.                
Sounded good until 2 years later it started creating it's own wind/rumble sound out of no where. I checked all of my equipment & connections and noticed it was the microphone making the worst wind/rumble/pop sounds ive ever heard.                 
For its price i didnt expect any features other then the standard cutoff settings. Comes in a great pro-finish looking briefcase that contains/holds the: The microphone,windscreen & shock mount                
It's a simple XLR connection from the microphone to the mixer or/preamp. No manual or/ technical help needed for that.                
Being my 1st condenser microphone, i didn't know exactly what's the difference in quality. But since using it often i now know,
It's pretty flat-naturally so it 'NEED's an eq & compression to give it more depth & warmer tone. It's very sensitive & picks up the smallest background noise.                
It's a good microphone if you want some added 'presence' in the 12khz range & above.                
I've havent had to call there support line yet but now that my microphone has gone psycho, it's out of warranty.                
Nothing other then the price that makes it Want-able.                
Good microphone for the whole 2years it lasted,and i babied it. May last longer for others, but i wont buy another one as theres better for a little bit more in quality & features.Will read reviews more closely before buying from a company that focuses mainly on just pricing.                
I think it's definitely a good mic to start out with. A first condenser when you record your vocals at home, or acoustic guitar etc... 
The truth is, you get bored of it... personally as I learned more and more about working on the audio, parallely I was groing out of the mic. So now that I want to move up and try my tricks on a better mic... I would, still, recommend this to begin with.. Its a decent mic, FOR 100!!                
Hey.... not all have -10 dB and low cut filters!                
plug and play, or so they say...                
Its a condenser mic... DON'T DROP IT MAN!!!!!                
For the money.. it's a good deal.. But I, at this point, would have bought another one.... Rode nt1 maybey.. AT 4040....                
I dunno                
It's like a purdy flower.... I like the look...                
NOT BAD FOR A 99.00 MIC. I WAS SURPRISED!!!                
THE B-1 IS OK FOR WHAT IT IS A GENERAL PURPOSE RECORDING MIC.IN THE
STUDIO OR OUT ON THE RUN IN CLUBS,AT CHURCH ETC....                
MADE VERY WELL,HEAVY DUTY CASES AND RUGGED ELECTRONICS.                
VERY CONSERVATIVE PRICE FOR THE QUALITY OF THE MIC'S THEY BUILD..                
HAVENT HAD TO USE DONT KNOW!!!                
IT'S OK...I DONT NEED A SEXY MIC TO GET GOOD SOUND...FOR WHAT EVER THAT MEANS ...........SEXY MIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
OVERALL THE B-1 AND B2-PRO ARE VERY GOOD STUDIO MICS. BEHRINGER HAS 
DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB OF PRODUCING GOOD MIC'S FOR THE MONEY, AND THE 
SOUND YOU GET FROM THEM!!!!!!!!!!                
I'm ham radio operator using this mike is awsome this mikephone is hotter than heil goldline mikephone,i heard from other and going to buy one used mine is good shape like new ! this mike went from s5 to s7 now s9 with this mikephone the mike is stronger than heil goldline that is why bh-1 went to s9 on my single report i use it every morning durning my weather net on 80 meters ! this mike is  a keeper ;)
when you use the make sure audio mixer my mixer is xenyx802 there is button is called: phantom it will work as long the button is pushed in !                
this mike is used for ham radio, i love this mike better it hotter mike that i found !                
my single went to s9 on single report on my ham radio !                
Crisp. Clean.                
You get a case, mount, windshield, cutoff switch. Wow                
Really seems sturdy and very professional looking metal finish.                
Wow! There's actually many cheaper condensers now that the far East is making them all, but this one seems tough to beat.                
In the past, I've contacted Behringer by email and heard back within a day or two.                
For the money, it's a real beaut.                
I know there's "better" mics out there, but there will be MANY other parts of my home studio I replace before this one.                
i have owned 3 of these microphones, and they all sounded pretty decent until they quit working, all in identical fashion.                
came with a nice case thar is at least still useful.                
no instructions neccesary.                
as i said, all 3 of my behringer b-1 microphones have ceased to function properly (i don't smoke, and i treat my equipment with great delicacy). 
first you notice a questionable low volume rustling sound, much like wind passing across the microphone. after a short while this progresses into full blown squealings and popping, with an unmanagable bass rumble. at that point, the mics no longer pick up sound. the random popping/squealing/rustling/rumbling is kind of interesting, but it's not at all the sort of use i was hoping to get from these mics.
VERY VERY SHODDY.
if you decide to buy one of these, you should consider your selection more of a "loan" of indefinate length rather than a "purchase".                
stay away unless you enjoy wasting your money.                
hopeless                
it's very sexy looking, i'll give it that.
might be cool if you could hang it from a matching necklace, serious "bling factor" there.                
i will never buy another behringer product so long as i live, unless i here stories of a miraculous turnaround in quality control.                
How does it sound? It sounds like a $100 condensor. NO, it does not sound as good as a TLM 103 or other high end mics. For the money, yea I guess it is a good deal maybe. I would personally go for the Studio Projects B1 in the same price range. This mic does not sound like $500+ condensors... sorry.. it does't even  sound like $200-300 condensors.                 
Comes with decent shockmount and case... nothing special... nothing bad.                
Chinese made, it looks OK I guess, it seemed to be pretty sturdy.                
I would go for the Studio Projects B1 in the same price range.                
It is a $100 condensor... you get what you pay for, no it is not superb quality, will it do for home musicians?? I guess that depends on how serious about your music you are. If you are serious look at some more higher end condensors.                
I haven't used mics upwards of 300 dollars but what I can say is that this is honestly the best sounding mic I've used.  It sounds better than an AT3035, an MXL 2001 (this sounded close but the highs were just so much more defined with the behringer when eqed), an oktava mk319, shure sm 57 lots of stuff... basically most of the mics in the 100-200 dollar range.  This one beats them all in my opinion.  However, EQing and compression is a must... I don't care what these people say, this mic (and most) will not sound their best without optimizing it's spectrum.                
typical.                
Something is wrong with the jack but it doesn't effect the mic when it's mounted so oh well.                
great value... I'd pay up to probably 20 bucks more but I'm cheap.  The Oktava Mk319 and AT3035 sounded really similar with some kind of housing  echo added... this mic blows them away.                
Never dealt with them.                
looks pretty.                
The mic for the home recording person.  While there are better mics out there, (listen to your favorite recording... there is only so much processing you can do... what it really comes down to is the source, the mic, and the preamp) this one will do for anyone in the 50-500 price range in my opinion.                
For the price the sound is incredible! People cant believe that I record my tracks in an apartment. - Elevatedmind Productions                 
I use this for mostly choirs, distant miked, and individual instrument soloist purposes. It works for the purpose - they tend to sound a bit better in halls with not very good acoustics - and is very sensitive, but very feedback resistant. Sounds like a what a large diaphragm mic should sound like, but tuned for clarity. Overall, satisfactory for the price. Can beat some mics costing 3-4 times the price for certain applications.                
Does what a mic should do. Low cut/pad switch works well and is thoughtful but NOT NOISELESS when you turn the switch, especially after a few months. MUTE, and i REALLY MEAN MUTE, the channel if changing switch positions for the sake of your speakers. Some 'think-i-know-it-all-about-sound' guy turned the switch when i was checking something else during sound check - fried some speakers in that one move. YOU WERE WARNED!!                
Plug, set and play, really...                
First is the above-mentioned switch. And the case it was provided with is falling apart. But that's after 6 years...                
It's a deal for the price.                
Behringer Malaysia distributor sucks. That's all i can say. I owned other stuff which had some QC issues or just simply was trashed and needs repair, and it needed quite a long time of arguing with the technician and send-backs before it was ok.                
It actually looks like a pro mic. Sounds quite like one. Feels solid. So...
Can mics really be sexy?                
I've been using this for about 6 years now for many events day in and day out. It's been trashed, but it's holding well. I'll buy more/replace it with the same in a heartbeat, unless something really worth comes along or this is discontinued. Having said that, Malaysia doesn't have much good deals with products.                
Hey,i need a new mic.hey,i need a new CHEAP mic.Hey,that Rode is too pricey for me.Why not the behringer?
I admit it.The B-1 is perfect if you're a fan of that thin,cheap sound,that really irritating thing known as Resonance.But hey,it's under 100 dollars so who cares,right?                
Lemme make it clear that this is NOT a 100 dollar condenser.Half the money you spent were Accessories.The awesome-looking case,the Shockmount and the Pop-Up,ball-type windscreen all cost money,Add the cable,and you got about 40 dollars of pure,lousy condenser microphone.                
Hey,it's a godsend to stupid people.Are you one of those idiots that don't know what a mic looks like?Get a new hobby.Everyone else,this one's easy.
B E H R I N G E R .
High Quality till i die-so i reccomend  a different brand.                
What do you know?Our first good grade!And why?Because of the features.                
When i want an answer to one of my questions, i want it from intelligent,dilligible people.Actually,i just want an answer.
         So there's no point in waiting for 3 hours on the phone while that behringer secretary drinks her coffee.                
I want it!This one's good for practicing on my darts!                
Naah.Rode.                
Whatever you read about Behringer, Yes some of their products really are of very bad quality, had a Europower mixer that broke down on its third use. But whatever, Behringer mics are OK, very OK indeed. The B1 is a nice sounding microphone that can compete with any condenser mic in the price range. The sound of the B1 is cristalclear, nice and even. Good for male and female vocals. OK, ist not a Neumann, but you won't get a Neumann for that price. I can highly recommend the Behringer B1, however the quality of Behringer products, their microphones are good.                
Check out the Behringer website, Its got a roll of switch, and -10 attenuation is possible too, comes with shockmount, carrying case and popfilter,not a bad package actually, especially for that price                
As any condenser mic                
I have the B1 since a about 3 years now, it never has let me down.                
Well, the B1 is good value for money                
I only can talk about their German support, I needed Behringer support in regards to a Behringer mixer. Now, to be honest, their support is no good, they are unfriendly and unhelpful, Sorry Behringer, but this is the truth                
zZounds is asking about the "sex appeal" of this product, what a stupid question, IT IS A MICROPHONE; - I have sex appeal, not the mic                
I give it it a 5, because of the Behringer german support, normaly I'd give it a 9 - (never give a 10 unless.... unless a 10 is 100% justified)                
In regards to sound I give this mic a 9, its not The Best - BUT - considering its price it deffinitely is one of the best. The Behringer B1 was my first large diaghramm condenser.I now own this for a few years and it never has let me down. I seriously think the B1 is one of the best sounding mics in this price range. Using it on vocals and acoustic guitar,- I like to state that the mic sounds natural, crisp and clear. Deffinitely better than most other chinese made condenser mics. Behringer has a bad reputation but with the B1 it seems they want to make up for that.                
Well, there are the usual features, check on the Behringer website                
Its as easy to use as any condenser mic, just keep it in the case when not on use and use a pop screen when singing into the mic                
I have my Behringer B1 since a few years, used it a lot and it never has let me down. So it seems to be of a very good quality. If you hold it in your hand actually I think you can feel it is very good quality.                
The Behringer B1 certainly is good value for money                
This I guess is what might break Behringer if they do not get their act in order. I once needed their support in regards to a Behringer mixing desk. If there is anything that will break the Behringer company it is their support, at least here in Germany. When I emailed them regarding a problem with the desk my email was ignored, not answered. So I had to re-send the email several times to finally get a reply. This reply was not satisfactory in regards to my problem. After all it took more than six month until I finally got a satisfactory reply to a simple (but not stupid) question. Speaking to their tech. support here in Germany - I find them rather unfriendly. Sorry Behringer, but that is my experience with your support.                
zZounds here asks:
"How would you rate the "sex appeal" of this product?"
We are talking about a MICROPHONE here,- Sex Appeal-?????? are you gone mad.                 
Good quality mic, great value for money, maybe one of the best in this price range                
perfect clear  but over exageret in hi freq...so alittle eq-ing s necessary..and u must use a class A preamp..w w important  don t use cheap preamp  liKE little BEHRINGER UB use one moore expensive..300$                
great..f u have great voice  s ok ,but f you re voice s not ok goo for expensive mic .for start 500$                
remember  a goot preamp..minimum 300$   minimum gain posiible                
s ok  f you re voice s ok..good f acoustic guitar

the price s w w cheap...and the mic s w w big in quality y have for 1 year  works perfect..and my STUDIO PROJECT C1 s big brother!!Dont get my wrong...goo buy B1...FOR THIS PRICE!! AMAZING                
Great sound. Mostly used on Vocals. Compares to more expensive mics.                
The switch is a nice addition for $100 mic.                
Very little editing required to get a good recording. Noise is very low.                
Great Quality on the vocal tracks I recorded. Have not used it for anything else.                
Can't beat the price                
N/A                
Great sound for the price, crystal clear signal, we compare it with Noiman, it had 10 percent less queality under the same conditions!                
Switch, give u the possibility of different kinda recordings.                
U just put it in ure mixer and turn on the phantom... Hehehe...                
Very good quality for the price.                
Great value for 100 bucks...                 
Dont need one. I have it for 3 years, and it works just perfect.                 
I have it.                
Really good mic for all kinda aplications.                
The sound of this is very silky. That would be a good thing, except it doesn't really have the bottom end to round it out.                
For a 100 dollar mic to have a rolloff switch and pre-attenuation device (pad)? Not bad at all. But if you're into stereo miking get a B2 with the switchable polar patterns. For the XY, M-S, etc...                
Ehhh would be a lot easier to make sound good with outboard EQ. But you don't have extra money laying around for EQ, that's why you're looking at this! I know. I've been there.                 
Nothing on it has broken with me. But I'm very careful with it. I still have the moisture absorber thing in the case with it.                 
For the price, it's a good condenser mic.                
I've never dealt with them.                
Haha. Part of the reason I wrote a review for this was to see if they actually ask you the "sex appeal" of a product. Well believe it or not they do! But yeah, it's hot. Only problem is I'm a dude, and I can only fit a female end in it. (XLR. Get it? Sound geek joke.)                
You know, like anything in this industry, you get what you pay for. If you are even reading this, you want a piece of gear with decent quality that's going to get the job done for less than the big boys. With the money you save buying this, also get a compressor(for like 80 bucks)and learn how to use it! THAT combination is going to really bring out the vocal track.                 
For a hundred dollars? Well, the sound is acceptable, but not great. It's clear and reasonably crisp... but gets very muddy quickly with proximity and has a rather natty harshness to it. No real air or depth, but ok for spoken word things as long as you compess and add some clever EQ. I work in radio, and alot of presenters prefer to use an SM58 over this, even though it's way cheaper. If you're serious about sound, you are better off going a bit more expensive.                
Frankly, too many features... pads and roll-off etc are all well and good, but your money would be better spent on sound quality.                
Again, I find having little switches on your mic is annoying. Radio presenters tend to fiddle with them, messing up your studio set up... it's just more things to worry about. Otherwise... it's a microphone... plug and play.                
Actually pretty sturdy for a behringer item. We've been using this 24/7 for over two years in our production and broadcast studios and people have bashed and knocked it all over the place, and yet it still works just as well as it did when we first got it.                
It's good value for the price, but I personally wouldn't buy such a low-priced condenser. you are better off saving your money for a Rode.                
Never used it.                
I don't care about 'sex appeal'... it doesn't look ugly.                
Good sound on a budget... but nothing more.                
it sounded great for a $100 mic, I was REALLY impressed. TILL the pos broke..                
who cares, it broke                
who cares it broke                
Behringer just plains sucks in the quality control department (if they even have one) my mixer crapped out and this mic, no more beringer for me. VERY disappionting too because the stuff had GREAT sound.                
IT broke                
LOL, till I ship it and pay for the cost, IF they even covered the repairs.... so I didn't bother, sucked up the loss and took it as a life lesson.                
not unless someone heads to chine to teach quality control. I won't be purchasing anymore behringer products.                
IT broke                
I HAVE NO TIPS BUT ITS JUST HORABLE I WASTED MY MONEY                
This mic produced the worst recordings I have ever made.  It was so bad that I switched back to a mic from radioshack that cost me $28.  The audio recorded was very soft and scrambled.                
It came with a shock mount. SO.                
As I said before very soft and distorted recordings with this mic. Oh, and it broke!                
Not worth the money, buy a cheap mic before getting this piece of crap.                
I guess its my problem now.                
nothing is sexy if it doesnt work/perform.  It was a good addition to my studio if I wanted something to look at.                
I still have it, and the only reason is that I hope to find some use for it since I payed a hell'a lot for it.                
warm sound. Transparent, clear.                
Good shock mount and hard shell case.                 
The mic seems very well made.  For $100 this is a steal.  I'm buying a few more for my recording applications.                
YOU SIMPLY WILL NOT FIND A BETTER MIC FOR THIS PRICE.                
I haven't had any problems with this within the year I've used it, so I haven't had to get support.  Registering is simple and can be done online.                
Feels great in your hand.... and looks great in it's mount.                  
Great value                
I bought these monitors a month ago and I looked @ the price and similarities of the KRK. They do play well and the price is right however, after a month of heavy duty music, the tweeter in one of the monitors blown. Luckily for me I contacted Behringer and will replace it due to their 3 year warranty. If you're on a budget get them.                 
I ordered the Behringer B1030A speakers and they are all I could ask for and the price was right.  Zsounds shipping was expedient and I would make sure to purchase from the company again for my needs.                 
I ordered the speakers and that is what I received.  The power cord came for each speaker and I didn't expect any other accessory with the speakers.                
I can say that I am not that experienced with utilizing studio monitors for my recording needs although I have recorded in various studios as a professional musician. As far as modifying the sound of these speakers I actually have not had to modify the sound because the sound has been fine.                 
This is a solid made product and as far as reliability I have not utilized them that long to truthfully voice the reliability of product.                
I actually purchased the speakers from Zsounds because they had the best prices.                
I have no reason to contact the company regarding this product.                
I think the speakers look just fine.  This was an economical purchase and the speakers were selected after reading various reviews.                
At the present time if these speakers were lost or worn out I would most likely purchase the same speakers.                
I bought this to use with my acoustic electric nylon string and it does the job wonderfully.  For small places I can use it a man - other times, makes a great monitor, even for gigs where there's a sound man, I prefer to have my own.  The sound is clean, uncolored and powerful enough for small gigs or even a well designed acoustic space.  Of course I use a pre-amp to into it for shaping the sound.  A great value    My only complaint: no handle!!!  What were Behringer thinking????                
I have owned mackie, electro voice and behringer but these speakers can rock. Light weight you can't belive the sound quality, the bass is great may not even need a subwoofer. If your looking for a DJ PA or for your band powered speaker these are the ones for you and zZounds is the place to buy them. My secound set of speakers i bought from zZounds and so far very happy with there service.                
Does a great job at keeping up with a drummer and a full band, I use this as a keyboard speaker. You really do cut through and it has an extended 3 year Behringer warranty. The sound is pretty good, everything you want out of a speaker this size. I had an alto TS 112 previously and this can hold its weight against one, although the Alto was a better quality. Only has 1 input, so you will need a mixer.                 
I run one of these with my Behringer xenyx 502 mixer and Behringer vq1500d sub.  Its loud, and clear.  Its good for mids and highs, the lows are OK. Im going to buy another soon.  Nice quality fit and finish.                  
Speaker is decently loud with nice sound.  Easy to use, seems to be made very well.  I use it for light music and for playing my guitars through.  It will not handle my Behringer electric drums.                
This is an update to the previous review  "rocky r from portland, or".
The sound quality is decent not great but there is a noticeable hiss after highering above 12 o clock (50% volume) 
The lows/mids can be distorted and muffled and dont cut through the mix too well when playing with drums. The sound quality is not as good as my alto ts112a i was being generous with that previous review but upon second thought I am going to try out the samson xp 112a. Use this primarily for live jamming with synths. 
The sound that you get with this speaker is incredible, yet very small, compact while delivering decent bass and solid sound. I'm actually gonna order a second one. I currently got it to use as a monitor for my small lounge gigs. You can easily rock a 150 person party with no problem. Great Unit!                
When I pulled this out of the box I thought it looked a bit underwhelming. I set it up in my living room with a Roland VR-09 directly connected and was impressed with how loud it could go and remain clean. Not the best tone, but not harsh. Not the best bottom end, but the EQ on the back of the speaker helped.
That night I took it to rehearsal with the full classic rock cover band I'm in. I set up the VR-09, a QSC K12, the Berhringer B112D, and ran stereo through a Mackie Mix5. (all purchased from zZounds BTW)
The 2 speakers complement each other very well. With a total of 2000 watts between the two it can be very loud and clear. I had more than enough headroom to keep up with Machine Gun Roy on drums, a Marshall stack and the bass guys Ampeg stack. I never really got above half way on the volume, and I really kicked a couple synth and organ leads hard!
I couldn't pull off a gig with just the B112D, but it really complements the K12 which wasn't quite enough. Plus the B112D will be easy to carry home for practicing.
Overall I'm very impressed with this little beast, and can recommend.                
Perfect purchase for the money... The speakers are so powerful, despite the size, and we were able to use it for a public event of almost 10,000 gathering. Thank you so much for so promptly processing our order and timely delivery. Will be back soon.                
Perfect for small venues. We run a DJ business and use these speakers for wedding ceremonies. They sound clear and crisp, which is perfect for ceremonies.                
The Behringer b112d are great speaker for the money I use them with native instrument traktor kontrol2 and they sound great when turn down low or cranking them up I would recommend these speaker to anyone that want a great speaker at a good price                
These speakers are pretty good, the only bad thing is you can't push that much bass out of them with out it clipping. I'm going to buy powered Subwoofers and I feel they will do a great job.. They sound really good and you can't beat the price.. I might also upgrade to the 15" behringer.                
Quality Sound for a good price cant beat that.                
The sound of these are really good. I'm using them with my DigiTech RP1000 and the Bluetooth makes learning new songs a breeze.                
They were easy to use just plug them in pair them with a phone, laptop ect and instant sound. Overall, they are a great speaker built well and seam tough.Features, are simple straight forward and easy to use. the Bluetooth feature is awesome exactly what I was looking for, I'm using them for a portable cinema and I use my laptop for all my needs and I didn't want cables in the way so people can trip on them, just pair one speaker to the laptop and than pair the speakers together and wala instant sound.Quality, Is good rugged and they don't feel cheap overall very good.Manufacturer Support, Haven't needed it yet.Sound, Overall is very good exactly what I expected except there is a limitation on Bluetooth you can get distortion on higher levels but other than that they are loud and have a great bass, mid and highs I am by no means a sound expert but they make better sound than my home system lol.Very easy to use .... Buy it Buy it Buy it....great price point for what I needed, how can you go wrong on speakers that sound great at $299 I know there are better,but your gonna pay a premium for them.go with B112W you wont be disappointed and that is the WOW factor.                
A LITTLE TECHNOLOGY SKILLS NEEDED TO SYNCH THEM BUT THEY DELIVER AS PROMISED.                
I can truly say that I'm satisfied with the purchase of this unit. We've used it for parties, Cheerleading events and other sporting venues with no problems. It's easily compatible with Bluetooth devices and the overall quality/sound is outstanding. We're in the process of purchasing another one.                
I originally bought this speaker for it's price. I was looking for a powered speaker and was in a budget at the time. I mostly wanted it for a restaurant I dj at, and was tired of carrying my amp and speaker. wanted to cut back on too much equipment. I was totally impressed with this speaker when I bought it. It is super light, sound is amazing. I don't crank it up much and speaker is blasting. The highs and mid sound good coming out of a plastic enclosure. the woofer has good deep bass to make the sound just perfect. I would truly recommend buying this speaker. I am definetly buying the 2nd speaker. Bought the first just as a trial run, pretty much. Just buy it, you wont regret it. I've had mine for 2 months. have done about 10 parties already, no problems as of yet.                
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE OF THESE SPEAKERS. THEY ARE LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMPACT. THEY ARE POWERFUL AND THE VALUE IS AWESOME.                
myself,and the groups i play with were shocked at what the speakers can do. we have yet to turn them up more than half way. crystal clear, and plenty loud. as a matter of fact, they quickly replaced my carvin tops. we do not even bring the sub half the time, because the kick, and bass pack a mean punch with plenty lows. great bang for the buck!                
I have had a set of these speakers for about four months and liked them so much, I bought a second set. I do A/V services all over the state and am switching over to powered speakers because I am tired of hauling amp racks into my smaller venues. 
One thing I really find interesting about these powered speakers is they actually weigh less than the passive speakers I was lifting up on speaker stands, and sound better. There is plenty of bottom-end punch and the high drivers are crystal clear. 
I also like the ability to daisy-chain them together via XLR out mix (of two channels) from each speaker which makes it easy to add more speakers as needed. 
I wish I would I would have had these when I was a performing musician doing an average sized bar.
I purchased two B115D Behringer speakers which make me three now, and I'm so glad I did. Being a mobile DJ, these speakers are light weight and store in the back of my vehicle with no issues. 
They sound amazing. Now, a shout out to all the reps at zZounds, these people are so polite , helpful. I've called in after other purchases to get info on the product(s) and I had an immediate answer. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK                 
i got a pair of these to use in a bar i dj out with some bottom ends and they sound amazing then i dj a biker event out side they did great and sound great they did not over heat they sound clear for the price you get alot of bang for your buck 
Thanks zZounds you guys rock                 
I bought these speakers after being satisfied with the B212Ds I've been using for may karaoke shows for the past two years. I was looking for 15s and was going to get the B215Ds but I decided to go with the B115Ds because of the 1000 watts of power. I an ecstatic with the sound! The sound as clear as my friends more expensive QSCs. Everyone who comes to my shows tell me my sound is off the charts compared to the other shows they go to. Great sound for a fantastic price.                
I just got a set of these a few weeks ago. They sound great with vocals and DJ Music. I DJ and KJ as well as MC Events, and I am so glad that i chose these. My Friends convinced me to add the Behringer B1800D PRO Eurolive Active Subwoofer, which I am glad i did. This helped with he lows and performance of my mains. If you a KJ I would suggest adding the sub! Last speakers i had were heavy these can be throw up with 1 hand!                
I use this speaker in conjunction with the rest of my band sound system. It puts out such strong low end that for most venues there's no need for a subwoofer . Light weight, flexible tone controls, and great sound. I'm going to buy a 2nd one!                
Love these powerful speakers. I use at my studio for social events and have no need to add more speakers. The music is clear and crisp. I am not a DJ but the djs I hire for events love them                
I own a pair of the http://www.zzounds.com/item--BEHB215D (Behringer 215D 550 watt) So I paired one of each the moment It arrived in the door. I was expecting the B115D because it is a 1000 watt to handle much better than the 215D, but to my surprise they Both started to clip right around the same volume level. with the volume and eq leveled out @ 12:00. If it was a true thousand watt, It would be able to drive harder before Clipping.                
I like the fact that you can use various audio cables on this item. Do not like the fact that you cannot stack them.                
Plug and Play, what else can you ask for.                
lighter than the B215D, I think because it is lighter it loses quality. The horns on the B215D sounds cleaner than the B115D. overall it is reliable.                
Great Price For the Speaker, but ask yourself a question, why does the B215D 550 Watt cost more than the B115D? the B215D is a better speaker, so get the B215D 550 watt, that's just my opinion.                
No                
Its an ok speaker.                
first of all Thank you zZounds for your fast processing and shipping. Now to get down to the review. I do not believe this speaker to be a true 1000 watt item. I am going to keep the one that I have but I will NOT purchase another. Get the B215D 550 watt that's just my opinion.                
the quality of the sound is great no matter how high you raise the volume and its very easy to use for the money its well worth it.                
Ok so I bought mine about a year and a half ago and honestly couldn't be happier. This thing has much power. Sounds clean and delivers. I'm a solo acoustic act from Indianapolis and an endorsed artist. Sometimes I like to bring in my buddy to play his keyboard and hook him up as well. My setup is 2x B115D powered speakers and a makie profx12.                
Recently purchased a pair of 115's (got an M and W at the same price due to no stock). Added a b1800 sub to the mix. absolutely phenomenal. Huge sound from 2 15s even in large venue. Having the m and w gives ability to daisy chain and just use iPod or phone playlist for smaller gigs if people want. These speakers add nicely with my yamaha mixer and I cannot fault anything. Highly recommend. Pay the price for the amazing quality.                 
These Speakers have an awesome sound and well worth the money..  10 of 10 from.. Just might have to get a couple more...                
one of the best buys best sound i herd in a powered speaker i got 4 and looking to buy more.                
i love this speakers sound good great buy. did a party a wedding a bbq and everybody kept saying how the sound system sounded. i think i made the right choice can't go wrong with this.                
Overall great buy!  Speaker works as intended and sounds great.  I bought refurbished and had a good purchasing experience.                
This speaker will give you great sound at a budget price. I use for small to medium venues, for larger you need to add subs.                 
I have gigged several time with these before I actually submitted this review. They sound good, clean, full. Seem very durable, and are light.                
Excellent                
Not happy returning them cutting out at low volume lots of crackling coming from speakers spoke to zZounds rep on Sunday waiting for return labels wish they where better but first time using them not happy lost an event had to call another Dj to do the event                 
If you are a mobile Dj Avoid these speakers they are terrible. as soon as you turn them up they will start clipping out, which is very embarrassing. avoid at all cost.                
Ok sound quality for cheaper active speakers.                
I recently purchase the B115D power speakers by Behringer about 29 days ago and the went out while DJing at a house party last night.                
 These speakers have a fairly flat response when I merered it with my RTA.. I can add graphs if anyone wants... but listening... They have a bit of a peak at 125 hz but when I add a little bass from the eq on back they sound great... I used a 15 band eq and with a drop at 120 hz and a little boost at 63 hz, these things are UNBELIEVABLE !!! I have been a sound engineer since 1990, and I have NEVER heard such a clear horn for this kind of money. I do not think the woofer is strong enough for the power but it is still breaking in so it may surprise me. The amp is very strong and clean.... again, for the money, these CAN NOT BE BEAT... They do not pull a lot of wall power either..                
The USB port / mp3 player is GREAT.. It is quick, clean, easy to use, and since I got these speakers, I pull one out, put a thumb drive in, and had GREAT sounding music while I set up. The 1st gig I did after getting these was a MMA fight event outside... I had 1 turned to the building where the fighters came out, the fast food joint ACROSS THE ROAD... STRAIGHT PAST THE RAMADA WE WERE PLAYING AT... asked me to turn it down, THEY COULD NOT HEAR ORDERS IN THE DRIVE THROUGH... The other I had toward the crowd of over 500 along with my 2 @ Yamaha club series 12" 2 ways on a Behringer mixer at 8 ohms getting 300 W RMS each and the 2 were not as loud or clean as 1 of these. I have 2 @ subs for bass and the Yamahas NEED the subs... This speaker does not. It definitely sounds better with a sub but it is not needed for small DJ gigs or for vocals in a large room.... I have a 30 band digital eq in my amp rack so I really had these sounding AMAZING but it took VERY LITTLE eqing to do so... 
The on board eq is great for simple systems and if you daisy chain the 2, the bass and trebble on one affects the other so just set the gain on the 2nd and control by the 1st...                
SUPER SIMPLE!!!                
These speakers seem to be very well built. I DO think the amp is too much for the woofer but the highs amp and horn are simply AMAZING!!!! The woofer soes sound better towards the end of the gig every time so it is still breaking in so we will see...                
This speaker is AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING VALUE. I WILL be getting more of these as I grow my sound company!                
I have not needed them for these, however, I did have to get a warranty claim for a mixer I have and it took about 7 hours to get it all taken care of... I have not sent it off yet but I will update this once I see how they are with that...                
The ONLY complaint is the sticker on the grill left a sticky film so I had to take the grills off and soak them to get the residue off.                
Ok.. They came in, I unpacked right away to check for shipping damage... packed well, no issues. Hooked them up... played pink noise then 20 hz-30 hz- 40 hz - 50 hz sine wave to break the woofers in a bit... at first they were very stiff so there was distortion when turned up about half power... After playing 20 hz for an hour or so, I played pink noise for another hour... then, I played Amazing Grace by LeAnn Rimes... Oh My Lord... These things are AMAZING!!!! Then I played a few songs that I always use for system tuning when I do installs and I have to say... These things sound fantastic....
      I am actually wanting 2 pairs of the nonpowered of these to replace my RECENTLY REBUILT Yamaha Club 12" mains... This speaker blows them away... The HORN is SO SMOOTH and CLEAN!!! I WILL have more of these as my company grows...                
I received my speaker and immediately hooked it up to,my pyle tuner,also purchased at zzsounds. the sound was incrediable ,compaired to the speakers I was using it was like,night and day. the speaker has to be kept on low volume in my mancave the power would blow the windows out.hooked up to,my tv,outstanding ,to my guitar ,great .for the price,unbelivable ! love my speaker.                
I purchased this item about 8 months ago and it's one of the best I've experienced. The quality sound is so solid and so amazing....I mean for the price is just exceptional. Thank you zZounds..                
It's great!!!                
I will simply say this... Every good review you've read about these are true!!!!.... I just got mines and I am like a kid on Christmas! !!..These are the truth!!!                
First..the 2 day shipping from zZounds rocks. The payment plan is almost too good to be true. Arrived safe and sound. Hooked them up in our "Wife Cave" in the basement for a karaoke night..vocals crisp, plenty of bass..won brownie points from wife! The pair were hooked up to a mixer and we used wireless mics. Couple days later on Memorial day weekend, placed them out by the pool, had a big party, and wow..sounded awesome! Bluetooth stereo function a giant step forward in enjoyment. Different people got in a que to play their fav tunes and they loved the sound! Many comments on how fun bluetooth was, the ease of pairing, and the quality of sound. I had zero issues after taking a moment to read the instructions. Bluetooth range in the house was not an issue, outside in the pool area, it was about 40 ft..quite sufficient for our needs..as we moved our phones further than that, the signal started stuttering. They look great. My 20 something kids moved them around for me..I'm told they are much lighter than most speakers they've lugged around. Never turned them up more than a couple notches..didn't need to.plenty of power. We played rap, top 40, dance tunes, even different languages, all sounded great. This has only been a week, but it was a good test week. Two events, inside and outside, just..wow. Hope this helps in any way.                
These Speaker Are To Powerful And Very Easy To Use. I Really Like Them Because Their Wireless And Have Base. I Only Turn The Volume Up All The Way On My Phone And On The Speaker To The 1st Bar And All I Have To Say Is Sheeeesh, Them Speaker Had Everything In My House Shaking And Zzounds Have Very Fast Shipping, I Ordered Them Monday Morning And They Came In The Next Morning, Their Just To Crazy That I Had To Order Another 1 Fast..                
Speaker is small and compact which is a plus for small venues. The speaker needs a little more power because it tends to strain after prolonged use. Overall they give a great sound if not pushed too hard.                
The sound quality is impressive when in close proximity to the enclosure up to about 60 feet where the bass that used to be there starts to drop dramatically. Of course, it doesn't move air and feel the bass like I get from my EV ELX118's, et.al. but one does hear a lot of extra bass.                
If you don't process your speakers (EQ, BBE, etc.) then there's still enough features to contour your music to your liking.                
Ease of use should be a no-brainer once you become experienced and refined enough of a DJ or musician to know the benefits of adding a bass enclosure.                
I really appreciate the look and feel of this cabinet. It feels solid, looks like it could be heavy, but it's not.                
It's a really good value and anyone should be able to purchase one with a high level of confidence. My only reservation is that the EV ZXA-1 12" sub is rated about 3 dB louder and I like my bass. However, at $200 less than the EV 12, the Behringer just barely edges out the EV which I probably would've purchased had they been $100 less.                
Have not had to deal with the company. This, after purchasing my first Behringer about 20 years ago.                
Taking into consideration the size, cost, weight, the fact that it's only one 12" woofer, and bass response. The WOW Factor is really good.                
Finally, there's an affordable powered subwoofer bin that's small and light enough to put in the trunk of car. It is also the solution for those small to midsize gigs like receptions up to 200 people. I like to use my EV ELX112's or PRX710's and hide one of these subs under the table to keep people guessing where all that bass is coming from. I'm looking forward to purchasing another one and put it side-by-side or stacked for increased bass while still using my mid-size car instead of the truck or trailer to go gigging.                
I purchased the first one six months ago for my bose l1 compact and was so pleased by what i heard when hooked up and connected, i decided to by two more for my two b208d powered speakers i purchased a month ago. All i can say is wow! the hookup was as always very easy and the sound is truely a perfect combination of midlow-hi with the satelites and musically punchy low end comparable to pa systems two or three times the price. It sounds like hi end home audiophile sound repruduction equipment but at hi spl levels. now my setup is complete. I still use my bose l1 compact for voice microphones and now my complete behringer setup for music reproduction as a dj for 200 people or less gigs. My dj freinds and i broke it in for six hours straight and all thier comments were positive. the found no flaws in the systems parameters and more importantly, wnhat they were hearing from both the satelites and the subs. I have a minivan and this all my equipment now fits in the recessed space behind the resr seat. I will never go back to big and heavy equipment. i wish behringer also made covers for the subs and carry bags for the satelites. that would be the icing on the cake.  
I bought this and was skeptical until I hooked it up to my Yamaha Stagepas 600i I just bought (both from zZounds). I'm 65 and trying to down size so I can do more sound jobs, family parties & to use as a traveling PA for the Praise Band that our church is starting. I was blown away by sounds that came out! I agree with all the other reviews, this is perfect & well worth the money (I didn't want earth shattering bass that makes your body pulsate each note)!! It is light enough to handle and compact enough to put it and everything else to do a job in the back seat of my extended cab truck or back of my wife's RAV4! And, it is light enough to carry without putting a strain on my back. I have had Behringer amps & BIG subs & I never had any problems with them what so ever. I can't wait to try this system outside (I may end up buying another one for outside jobs & will probably finally sell my big, cumbersome Peavey SP2s)!                
The sound is great within close proximity of my set up.  As to be expected from a 12", the lows dipped little by little after about 30 feet.  You can pinpoint a frequency and increase the volume at that point which I found useful at lower volumes.                
At lower volumes you can increase the presence of bass by pin pointing a low frequency and then increasing the attenuation.  Volume control is idiot proof and LED will let you know when you should trim the low end.  The physical features are that the box has a small foot print and is relatively light for a bass enclosure.  Alas, the cost is definitely a feature and one does not get what they pay for--they get better!                
Ease of use is self explanatory.  If I were to make one slight improvement, that would be to include XLR AND 1/4" in and outputs.                
The product is well made, does not feel or look cheap.                
All other 12's that I've researched either cost a lot more or are bigger/heavier.  Aside from Sampson's 12" sub (which cost more than this product) you can buy TWO of these for the price of one of the others.                
None of the many Behringer products have ever faltered therefore I've not used the support systems.                
I not only use this for my small to medium gigs, I use it in my home studio and theater.                
I own dual and single 18" and 15" sub cabinets and was looking for bass that would enhance my gigs that are smaller and can fit in my sedan (versus truck or trailer).  Needless to say, as I get older my subs really start feeling heavier.  The Behringer B1200D-Pro was the answer to my situations.  I've used them in a ballroom, dining hall, outdoors, and other events without having to use my gas-hungry truck or trailer.  I teamed this sub up with my ELX112p's, or my JBL PRX710, and even my JBL EON610's and am quite pleased with their enhancement to already nice speakers.  Sure, you can't feel the bass like 15's or 18's offer up, but clarity of the low end is something appreciated by anyone listening. I bought a second B1200D and will give review when a do a few gigs with both.  My lower back pain from a youth injury really appreciates the subs and the price point is pretty low compared to other 12" subs.                
Added with my two 15in Mackie Thumps and couldn't be happier. Decided to with these to relieve the pressure of the thumps and for in house use only and it worked flawlessly. Can't wait to get another one.                
I bought this to add to an existing small PA system. It works as I had hoped to fatten out the sound by adding some bottom end. It is well made and the controls are quite easy to understand. Lightweight too for transporting it to gigs. I wish the receptacle on top was 1 and a half inches to match the one on my PA column but I was able to devise a pole that would work for both so I no longer need a tripod stand for my PA column. It mounts so that it is "one" with the subwoofer for a clean look on stage. Really adds a lot to recorded music played through the system. Not sure it adds much to my live sound but it certainly doesn't hurt. Price was right. Glad I bought it.                   
This subwoofer is very portable at only 43 lbs. Most subs are closer to 100 lbs.I use this with my Europort eps500mp3 portable PA system and hook the sub to the monitor send and it works like a charm. Gives quite a bit of bottom to my Martin acoustic-electric and vocals.Adding this sub to the above PA you can DJ any party in quite a large room with volume to spare! Very well built and should take to the rigors of the road.                
I JUST RECIEVED THIS POWERED SUB TWO DAYS AGO AND ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW! I AM USING IT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE "UMPH" TO MY BOSE L1 COMPACT PA SYSTEM AND IT MORE THAN DOES THE JOB.  I FEED THE SIGNAL TO THE SUB THROUGH THE XLR OUTPUTS ON MY NUMARK MIXDECK AND THE L1 COMPACT THROUGH THE MASTER RCS OUTPUTS. THIS ENABLES ME TO MINIMISE THE LOWER FREQUENCY ON THE L1 AND COMPENSATE WITH THE B1200-PRO SO THE INTEGRATED BOSE AMPLIFIER DOESN'T WORK AS HARD. THE RESULT IS VERY ARTICULATE MID AND HIGHS AS BOSE CAN REPRODUCE AND A NON-BOOMY POUNDING BASE THAT BLENDS IN PERFECTLY WITH THE MAINS MID-LOW FREQUENCIES. MY SYSTEM IS ONLY USED IN 100 PEOPLE OR LESS VENUES.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR MY NEXT GIG. I HAVE THE PERFECT SMALL FOOTPRINT SETUP. THIS SUBWOOFER IS SMALL, LIGHT AND POWERFULL ENOUGH TO FULFILL MY NEEDS AS A DJ. ARTICULATE TIGHT BASS AND USER FREINDLY ATENUATORS FOR COSTUMIZING SOUND REPRODUCTION. AWESOME LITTLE BEAST!                
I just received my Behringer B1200D-Pro Active Subwoofer and I am blown away at the quality and power of this sub. I played Halloween night and can say that the performance of this small sub was outstanding, I used this in conjunction with 2 new EV ZLX 12 Passive speakers...... impressive combo.                
I bought this as a blemished unit for a substantial discount, but could not see a mark on it and it seems to work just fine. Main reason to buy was to fill in the low end for a pair of line arrays I built using eight 2-1/2" speakers in each, and when properly adjusted it sounds great, with more volume than I need. I also used it with my conventional Harbinger ten's for a small gig with the bass player going straight into the PA and it was excellent for that too, in a small room.                
This subwoofer made a night and day difference. I use two behringer 15" speakers for DJ and they hit , but when adding this subwoofer it makes the sound. If you get it you will never want to be without a sub again.. the sound is amazing . I wouldn't recommend using it for big venues as it is just a small sub. But using it in small to medium venues it will do the job. I currently ordered another one and waiting for it to arrive. Can't wait to see how much two will do.                
Bought this sub for a DJ gig in Manhattan but ended up not using it (I got it the same day and didn't hook it up right). Finally spent some time reading the manual for my Behringer XENYX X1622USB mixer and got it to work. It's an amazing compact little sub with a big sound. Fits in the trunk of my car with 2 B115D powered speakers!! It's perfect for a small venue. I could transport all my gear to a gig in the car with room for 3 people on the back seat. I have the 18" sub for bigger gigs but I'm thinking this might be just what the doctor ordered. That said, the 18" sub is by far a much better fit for wide open spaces or larger rooms because it moves air like you wouldn't believe. But for a small gig in a small to medium sized room with rapid setup... this is awesome!!!!!!                
I had no grand expectations when I purchased this unit. I bought them to do small weddings and private parties. For $299.00 you get a decently built sub that will add some ok bottom end to a small DJ set up. You have to watch your levels as it will clip when the bass sounds its best, but I really can't complain about its output. My small rig of QSC K8 tops and these on the bottom sound really good. I kind of regret not getting the EV ZXA-1 instead, but your talking $600 vs $300. I did not think that I was getting the extra $300 worth of sound with the EVs. I have a Pro X rack with a Denon MC6000MK2, rack mounted wireless mics, mounted furrman power conditioner, lights, table , cables, 2 tops and subs that fit in a Ford Fiesta subcompact car. I am going to purchase the EV EKX 15sp Sub for Medium to large gigs but for 50% of my work, this set-up will work fine. If you are a club DJ I do not recommend that you get these. You need boomy bass for a club, and you won't get that with these or any other 12. (Maybe QSC K Sub at 3x the price). Time will tell how long they last, but all in all a good deal.                
This class D amplification continues to amaze me. These little gems really put out great bass. The enclosure is very well made and the coating is tough as nails Ive never seen anything like it. They do exactly what they are designed to do and that is filling small/ medium size venues with sound.They do not have a long ( throw) like larger subs that you have to stand way back to hear the bass, These put all the sound right where it needs to be. Ive read some reviews that said they had trouble with clipping but I had no issues .. If you like playing material below 40HZ all night long you might want to get a 15" or 18" sub. For the size, weight, features and cost it doesn't get any better.                
I have recently been upgrading DJ equipment to smaller, lighter, better. I suffered a major back injury a few years ago and hauling my big heavy rig with power amps, compressors, mixer all rack mounted in a 300# rolling rig box plus the 4 speakers wasn't working anymore. I mated this Sub with 2 EV ZX12s 1000W active speakers and a small Behringer 6 channel board and WOWWWW!!! The EVs stand alone sound really good but adding this Sub made it amazing. Like watching a 2d movie then seeing it in 3D!!! It's small, light and very punchy. Sure the 15" is more boom but for the weight and size I'll keep my 12. I've gone from about 600 #s of equipment to just over 200 with better cleaner louder sound than I've ever used. I can do rooms up to 500 people with NO Problem. With new smaller LED lights I carry my complete Rig in a Dodge Charger with room for 3 to travel. Unreal. Gotta love the new technology. I recommend this sub for any DJ or live band setup. Adding a 2nd Sub for bands would be recommended.                
Great sound! I'm very happy with my purchase from ZZounds.                
You get a lot of “Bass for your Buck”! I bought this little bad boy because I was tired of hauling my Big 18 inch subs to gigs. Now I don’t want to say this little bad boy puts out what my 18 did... But it does put out some good Clean Bass and I will be buying a 2nd one to cuple and will be more than enough for any mid size venue. Get it you won’t regret it!                
I purchased my B1200D about 5 months ago after I Sold my 2 Eurolive B1800 pro passive subs that weighed a ton! I had owned and used them heavily for live music and Mobile DJ gigs for about 6 years. These days I am just DJING and did not want to haul those big subs and thought I would buy one and give it a try. When it got to the house how small and light the box was in comparison to my 18 inch subs. Oh my!!! But when I hooked them up and heard them there is nothing little about them they put out a lot of clean and defined bass. The cab is super sturdy and looks nice. It’s perfect for a small to medium venue 100-150 people. I am in the process of purchasing another to pair and use for bigger venues and I will be set... Don’t be scared feel confident buying these bad boys they won’t disappoint or let you down.                 
I wanted a small compact light weight sub, not to thump bass but to create a 3 way system with 2 way cabs. So these fit the bill. I have actually had good results with Behringer in the past. New units were on back order so when this one used one came available I bought it right away. Unit did not work, however ZZounds sent me a return shipping label and made an immediate refund. Great for ZZounds, not for Behringer. I ended up buying an EV from ZZounds instead.                
I just bought 2 of these and let me tell you. The sound is incredible and the best part is I've only tested and used one. It has me second guessing if I even need 2. So much power it's unbelievable. And the sound quality is amazing with so much definition. This puppy can hit across all the bass spectrum and can get very low. Plenty of head room, adjustments and features.Cons: Well built and solid, but quite heavy. Also would have loved if Behringer wouldn't have provided optional caster wheels. I want to add them, but scared it may void my warranty.Overall: For the mobile DJs I highly recommend these, just keep in mind they are solid and heavy. Considering the quality of sound, and the amount of power you are getting. These are a dream for small budget studios. So the bottom line here is, don't hesitate. Just get them, YOU WILL "NOT" REGRET IT!                
I bought just one of these as part of my new smaller & lighter mobile DJ set-up along with a pair of Behringer B615D's and a Behringer 1204USB mixer. This speaker is so strong that even at a lower level with only one of these you'll be impressed by the way that it sounds & how it compliments the B615D's and fill a large venue with ease. I'm really impressed by this speaker's tremendous sound & power and I'm glad that I purchased this Behringer B1500XP sub                
A great sounding speaker. Great lows, crisp highs. Well built, and good features.                
Recess handles for easy carrying of speaker. Stand mounts in bottom of speaker. The only downfall would be speakon connecters, The best way to connect, but not everyone is set up for them.                
I use two Behringer EP 2500 amps. One amp for my two Behringer mains and one for my (2) 18" Subwoofers {Not Behringer} Due to this match system It was easy to achieve great sound from the start. I found the manual to be very user friendly and informative.                 
Found the speakers package from the factory in top notch condition. After carfull inspection of the speakers, I found them to be of great workmanship. In my opinon, These speakers were built for on the road abuse. These speakers are built to be used.                  
These speakers are worth every penny and more. Don't know how they do it.                
No Problems with any Behringer products. I have used their EP 2500 amps for 2 years just about every weekend for gigs, and they just keep pounding. The Behringer mains only 2 months, but going strong.                
Behringer made these speakers easy on the eye. Have had positive comments on the design and sound.                 
I feel that I can expect years of service due to past performance from behringer. I feel I could buy a higher price speaker, But not a better built and sounding speaker. I have check several different brands, same size and type of speakers. And found Behringer to be the all out winner.                   
I run 2 each B1520's and 2 each B1220's no subwoofers and powered by the 1200 watt PMP5000 mixer which I bought as a package deal. Awesome sound and power not only for the price. My last PA had 2 jbl 115's and 2 each EV force i 115's. The Behringer speakers sound as good for WAY LESS MONEY. I will never waste money buying other brands just buy top of the line Behringer and you can't go wrong.                
People that complain about having speakon inputs have never pulled out a 1/4 jack by stepping on it!                 
Excellent light weight and multi position design allows them to be stacked or laid on their sides in 2 positions for use as monitors.                
Even thoght the box caught hell from OOOPS [UPS] the speakers were flawless and the same with their design and construction. I ONLY WANT MORE OF THEM!                
Only the Peavey 2 15's can compete                
Don't know!                
Only the Peavey 2 15's are Sexier!                
I believe these will be the last speakers I will ever need but even if I do blow them up I will buy more of the same! I plan on buying 4 more plus a Behringer 2500 amp!                
The highs and mids are crisp. But don't expect a lot of bass. But most people use a good subwoofer for that anyway so no huge suprise. So for highs and mids they're good. I used to be a 'Peavey only' person and picked up these for my own budget system for live sound at convention centers, churches etc. They sound every bit as good as the Peaveys that we have at church.                
Handles are good. Weight is no worse than any 15" 2 way speakers I've handled. These were my first to use Speakon connectors. I like them so far and think the speakon connections probably give a better high power connection. I like the way they can be used as stage monitors as well.                
Plug and play. Learn your eq like any other sound product. The instructions tell easily how to turn the horn for use as a floor monitor.                
Quality seems good. I've not over-driven the speakers but they seem to handle the power good. I use a QSC amp and have cranked them high with no big distortion problems. They survived UPS with no problems or blemishes. Connectors seem mounted very well. I don't have any quality concerns.                
I think they're worth the price and would serve good for most applications. I doubt you'll see Behringer on any big name band's stage anytime soon, but in sound, I found that many are snobbish about 'brands'. Compared to Peavey (I've used Peavey most), I think they're a good buy.                
I called the company prior to purchasing the speakers and they were helpful enough. I was put in contact with a tech, not just a warm body looking at a computer for pre-fabbed answers and I appreciated that.                
The main draw to this product is it looks good and the price is good. For what I use them for, I'll probably get a couple more and a more powerful amp.                
These don't have quite the SPL rating as say the Yamaha S115V, but still have a good rating.                
At first when I took them out the box I figured they would be difficult but they were easy for what its worth if you get the subwoofer to go along with the speakers you have one of the best sounds out right now.                
sounds great. a little e.q. but not bad                
has only neutrik connectors. better current carrier than other connectors. make sure you prepare for this.                
stamped 15. sounds great though. awesome low end for the $                
better than some higher priced speakers                
look great                
I've been biukding my own or buying my own pa speakers for 30 plus years and I have to say this is Behringer best PA speaker design yet.  For a 15 inch PA speaker, it is compact, light making it easy to maneuver. With the mixer set at 0 decibel and connected to  a Xenyx 2204USB mixer, the signal quality is audibly smooth and articulate. For small to medium venues,  you don't need a separate sub. The bass this beast puts out is very punchy and exceptionally musical. The mid/hi frequency output is crisp, clear and loud. When I pay these off, I will purchase the B1500X 3,000 watt powered subsubwoofer counterpart to these PA speakers For bigger gigs. I am extremely impressed at their affordability and second to none quality build. Behringer is a big enough name for me when it comes to PA/dj equipment.                
Ordered this sub completely out of curiosity. 3,000 Watts for $700 seemed to good to be true. I know Behringer gets bashed but they have come along way with there products and the way they re built. Long story short, this sub hits and hits hard! Its tight and punchy and when the bass boost is put on it really drops it to a lower sounding thump. If not using a cross over it will clip fairly easy with the bass boost on but can be easily dialed in. Cabinet is built solid and very well. I have 2 EV ETX 18’s as well and this Behringer can hold its own. It’s doenst have the deep low rumble that the EV’s have but it will not disappoint. If you are looking to spend less then a $1,000 on a powered sub then these sound just as good if not better then the other brands at a higher price. Do yourself a favor and give them a try!!                
Using the cheap gemini xover and the behringer 2500 amp. Just bought this item and I will absolutely recommend it. I upgraded to two of these subs and for the money I paid, myself and the croud was amazed.                 
No complaints here                
Very well built and very sturdy.                
compared to the higher priced subs, these are the bomb.                
Never had to call.                
I expect to keep these for a while. When it is time to buy new ones, I will buy them again.                
This Sub does hit really hard. It absolutely gets the job done with providing those Deeeep low's, hard hitting bass (rap, reggae, techno, dance, etc.), and does an excellent job of handling those 1600watts of power. The only thing about this sub that i don't like is: when used outdoors it tends to seem a little on the rough....kind of mushy sound side. But hardly enough to notice unless you are the kind of person who know's PA equipment and are someone who knows what to "listen" for.                 
Simple Features, Bi-Amp, or Passive. Haha, doesn't get any easier than that.                 
Need i say anything? Piece of cake.                 
I give quality a 9. Behringer is not in the business to have the BEST sounding equipment. They provide people like you and I with the opportunity to have a large scale sound PA system without causing finincial strain and frustration. Their equipment sounds great for the money you get and this sub is an absolute perfect example of that. Keep it up Behringer!!                
For the money, this product perfectly does the work for what you pay. I would suggest this Sub to anyone!                 
I have not needed any kind of support yet for any of thier products. So give an 8 just to be curtious :)                
Uhh......don't really see the need for this question. I wanted it, so i bought it right? haha                
Overall, i think that Behringer is doing a great job and hopefully will keep coming out with better products in the future. I know that i am completely satisfied with all the their products that i own, and i really don't have anything negative to say about them. HUGE bang for the buck. Tell your friends!                 
Huge BASS and punchy! This Sub is perfect for my rock band.                
Doesn't need accessories.                 
Super easy to use. It has internal crossover. I went from my board into the sub then into my mains. That's it.                
Made very well. Extremely durable and it looks beautiful.                
The price is great. I paid $340 for it.                 
Hopefully won't have to.                
It is very sexy. Black and sleek.                
I will keep it forever.                
For a 'value-branded' product, these subs do a very good job!  Let's face it, if you're looking into Behringer it's likely because you may not have money for, say, EVs or JBLs.  To a large extent you tend to get what you pay for with sound equipment.  That said, these subs are very, very good for their price range.  They can handle a lot of power and certainly fill out our sund quite nicely.  I did compare these to some higher end gear, and they do a really good job of holding their own!                
Any passive sub with a built-in crossover is a good thing!  Being able to run from your subs directly to your mains without additional amps is nice.                
For the mosty part plug n play!  If you opt to ust the crossover, though, you must be sure to have the biamp/passive switch in the right position.                
Solidly built overall.  I have pushed these with no distortion, and the speakers don't overextend themselves when you crank it up.  Crazy heavy, but again it's nice to feel like you have a solid piece of gear so it's par for the course.  Overall, anyone with a clue knows that Behringer is not in the "top of the line" equipment tier.  Their products exist to provide the average Joe with a way to assemble a quality large scale system with a smaller investment, and they do that quite well.                
For what you pay, you clearly get more than your money's worth with these.  Also, you can't beat the fact that ZZounds not only matched but BEAT a competitor's procing on a pair of these!                
Gave a 5 simply because I have had no need to deal with Behringer for any suport.  I have these subs, a powered mixer, a bass amp, and other Behringer speakers as well, and over the years have had no need for support.  That's probably the best thing you can say.                
What?!?!?!  It's a sub...you want bottom end you buy one (or 2!).  They do look nice, but they're speakers.                
These subs work very well.  They do what you need them to do, and the added crossover feature is a nice touch.  I will keep these until they die, and based on the obvious quality I would think that will be a long time from now.                
Good overall sound for a value line subwoofer. I have no room in my rack for a crossover, but when used with either the QSC or Behringer knockoff amps, you can use the switch on the back of the amp. This sub has a passive input which helps just a little more too. Still some sound coming through I wouldn't want in a subwoofer, but for saying this system doesn't have an active crossover AT ALL...it's great!                
I don't use it, but it does have a biamping feature that provides you with the passive crossover. If you only have one amp this is a cool feature. You can patch directly out of the back of the cabinet to your full range satellite speakers. Not many cabinets have this feature.                
Really simple, plug your cable from the amp to the "IN" port. If you have satellites, plug them into the "OUT" port. And don't forget to set the switch on the back to "PASSIVE" or "ACTIVE". (I think those are the options for the switch)                
A really good piece. If you didn't know what the quality of Behringer was, your first thought would be more along the lines of JBL or Yamaha. But the price will tell you otherwise. I have some of their electronics too, and I have NO complaints. Great gear especially for someone wanting good entry level stuff that doesn't break the bank that you can definitely depend on!                
Definitely worth a look!                
Have had no need to call.                
This isn't a flashy to the eye cabinet. Looks really similar to all the others. But price, specs and the features drew me to this unit. And it serves it's purpose very well.                
The only beef I have, is the rubber feet. My trailer has a non skid style carpet and the feet got stuck many times loading the first few shows. I eventually tore them off and went to my local music store and bought a set Peavey replacement feet which did the trick. Not a major deal but worth mentioning. Have had this for over a year, and the carpet has held up fine. But beware as with all carpeted gear that sits on the floor, don't get it wet with soda, beer or rain. Smelly carpet usually gets a thumbs down at ANY event!                
Great piece. it sounds better if not on mono. maybe cause I am pushing this with a behringer PA 1500 amp. I may have to buy a stronger amp to put it to the test, but other than that, great for the price                
no complaint so far, is as easy as 123 to set up, Idiot proof!                
If you have a good crossover(3 way stereo or better) it do you justice.                
Solid as a Rock!. Build to last a lifetime, no doudbt!                
for the price, there is no doubt, you wont find a better product of this quality and brand at this low price, Do It, regrett it.                
have not have any problem so far with this two units I bought in 2004. that's why I rated a 7.                
great looks. it gives that pro-look and great presentation of you and your equipment, it look slike you pay lots of money for it,"that's what I say"                
Like I said be4, I had it for 4 yrs, still no complaints.                
The sound from these things is awesome!  They deliver all of the lows you need for just about any gig.  Be it dj,or band.
Its punchy and loud and also sensitive for a sub this size.                
In order to use this as passive, I had to purchase a seprate speakon connector and solder it to a 14 gauge speaker wire for my amp.make my own
connection.
I now have different speakon cables I use, one when I use the internal crossover, and one when I use the crossover in my Behringer fbq1502.
It may be work to some, but I consider it part of the hobby and educational.                
plug and play.                
built solid, the grill could have been a hair thicker, but otherwise A+                
Cant be beat                
Very atractive                
Behringer has come a long way, I believe its because they make there own stuff now and don't need to give their blueprints to some sub contractor in China. (although they are still in China.  Behringer City to be exact)                
It sure does what i expected it to do and so far it has passed all my tests.                
The crossover feature is really helpful and really came in handy when i only had one amp for 4 speakers, also the feature to only have to use one 4 wire cable from the amp to the sub and then a 2 wire cable from the sub to the top is a great feature, if you don't know how to do it, learn it before you buy if you're buying 2 tops and 2 subs.                
you plug it in and that's it                
the quality is good for the money but still could be better                
The value is huge, you're getting so much for your money, if you don't have a big budget, look no further. It's as simple as that.                
there is a terrible support for Behringer products just to make that clear, these are low end products assembled in china and so when it comes to a hardware problem it's easier and cheaper to buy a new product                
the speaker is made out of a plastic wood and looks pretty similar to all other speakers so it's the spec and price that turns me on, if that's what you're looking for.                
The product has a really great value and both looks and sounds great and if you ask me, I'm buying at least 2 more subs and 2 more tops.                
Love the Eurolive series of speakers. Have (2) subs and (4) 15" Eurolive speakers.
The sound is unbelievable and the price is great. Have DJ'd parties from small to large, I haven't had any issues yet                
These subs are all around great speakers, the only thing I would ask Behringer to improve is the crossover. Awesome speakers, I won't get rid of them til I get out the business.                
Simple, just plug & play..                 
Have no complaints. Sturdy design, stackable, strong handles for ease of transport. Easy to clean material for those party goers that have a habit of putting drinks on speakers.                 
Can't go wrong for these prices. Lots of bag for the buck.                
Haven't needed to use them, which says a lot about the product.                
I plan on keeping these, now looking to add the powered versions.                
For what it is this sub kicks!  Great for dj work or bands.                 
The best feature is the built in cross-over.  We daisy chain these with our mains and it works perfectly. No crossover needed!                
Plug and play!                
Ive played over 150 shows with them and have had no issues.                 
Great                
Havent needed it                
"Truth" is a good name for them. Each speaker comes with its own response curve. Mine shows fall off at 40 hz, they only claim 50, and good up to 15khz. .I use them for mixing, so everything I hear on my computer is clean, flat, and clear. I hear things most other people do not hear. If you care, they are what you should have.                
amazing sound sound unbelievable great.......small monitors but hit hard like the big ones....sound is unbeatable at this price...would recommend to anyone looking for a space saving monitors that sound great/..............                   
adjustable controls to compensate for your acoustic environment.. making just perfect for your studio................                
plug and you ready to go................                
product is great made....heavy duty and weight like a real big monitor..........                
its worth every penny...............................                
GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
not planning anytime to upgrade my monitors...they sound great..space saving and sound REALLY LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1                
Having used a variety of monitors, I was surprised how well these stack up. They sound far more expensive than they are. The build quality is solid and they have an unobtrusive appearance (I prefer monitors that blend in).  I use them for daily listening and comparisons with my main monitors. They have a nice low end (especially for the size) and detail is on par with more expensive monitors. They aren't fatiguing at all and sound quite neutral. I would easily recommend them to anyone on a budget.
The only issue I take with them is they make a decent pop when I turn them on. I've wired them every which way I can and it made no difference. I've never had a set of monitors (I've owned a dozen) that made a similar pop. They operate flawlessly otherwise.                
Very solid sound, Balance of sounds were similar on speakers I played the final mix on subsiquently. The Bass was still right where it was, as were high parts. No surprises on any type of speaker set, even cheap laptop speakers reflected the mix done on the truth monitors pretty well.                 
very solidly built, and in this price range they are outstanding.                
Speakers in this price range usually come with 4" or smaller speakers and don't have seperate amps for each speaker. The value is incredible.                 
no issues so far                
It looks great, like a speaker should.                
I searched for at least 3 months. I don't see a reason to search for another monitor set.It meets all my goals. If it were stolen. I'd buy the same thing as a replacement.                
If you couldn't figure out how to connect these with ease then Lego toys are more up your alley                
Never needed                 
I can truly say that I'm blessed with this product. I'm new to producing and I brought these monitors 08/2014 with no issues with set up or product period. I'm still learning the effects to put on my sounds but I can say that with the little I know that I get dead on mixes with out going back and forth to monitors and car speakers. Never used other monitors but very satisfied with this product

Sound is so clear and detailed that I'm shocked at times of its clarity and precission                
Crossover design is very well made and matched to its drivers                
So easy to adjust and connect                
Again, I use these units 10 hours a day in my recording studio and they are fatigue free                 
It's price is ridiculously low for the quality you get out of these monitors                
I haven't had any problems so never dealed with the factory                
Looks OK...it shows the quality of materialship                
I've owned them for over a year now and they will be with me for a long time                
I don't know what that first guy's issues and malfunctions were (his, not  the monitors).  I auditioned these in an A-B comparison with Mackie's.  The Behringers were over 90% as good as the Mackie monitors... for 2/3 less of the price.  At $600 a pair these would be a great deal.  At $300, they're a steal!  The imaging is so precise it's beyond stereo and clean on into 3-D.  The bass is also precise, punchy, and there's more headroom that you can stand being in the same room with.                
I'm giving it a 9 in the features department.  I can't think of anything else I might need or want, but I'm sure there's SOMEthing.. maybe a remote control so you can set levels and such without touching the sound board?
One of the big things to remember is that these are sold as matched pairs, and that, as an Active/amplified speaker pair, the amps are designed specifically for these speakers, to match them.  That's a whole lot better than finding out your speakers are flat but the amp is coloring the sound.                
Out of the box, plug 'em in, they sound awesome.  You CAN tweak 'em, but ya don't need to.                
Again, a 9.  They could have been made of solid hardwood or titanium or something, so they don't get a perfect 10.:)  These are studio monitors, and I don't know of ANY such monitor that can go on the road straight out of the box, but they're certainly well built and attractive.  The covers come off easily, but are not flimsy.  I've had no issue with any of the pairs I've bought so far.  (I set up project studios for other people as well.)                
I'm still not even sure how they manage to make this without going broke.   Others sell far lesser monitors for more money.                
I'm sure there's room for improvement somewhere. Maybe the rep could carry them into my studio and build the custom stands for them, hook up the wires for me?
I've never had a problem, so I can't say how their customer service department is.  That said, since the very best customer service is to not need them at all, in my experience, they deserve a 10.                
When you hear these things, feel the punch of the kick drums through them, SEE the 3-D imaging in your mind's eye, they become more than just black and sexy.  These things are awesome!                
If I had $10,000 to spend on monitors, I might find some audiophile speakers to listen to a final mix with, but chances are that I'd have mixed it with these anyway.  
Fact is, we listen to our music at much higher quality and through better equipment than most of our audience ever will.  If they got any more accurate, I'd wonder how they cloned me. Live or Memorex?  More like Live or Truth?!  You could probably spend more money, but why would you want to spend more and get lesser monitors?                
these monitors are aweful.  Had to send them back once (to germany) for waranty repair.  They are not recomended for stereo mixing.  Spend some money.  don't buy crap.                
I'll start off this review by noting I've been using these monitors now for 7 years, so I'm not some excited newbie I'm actually a guy that's been recording for about 17 years now and have had this product for 7 years. I'll start by noting how flat these are. They are perfect in that whatever I play on them that sounds bad sounds bad on all other systems. Whatever sounds good translates to sounding good on other sources. Being I've had mine so long I have to rate the quality very high as I've had ZERO problems with mine - no joke... not one problem, though I've read some horror stories from some owners. That being said I'd like to note I've read some slight speculation on the net that the older models, such as mine, are far better in quality than the more current models... again though that is purely specualtion from 1-2 people.
I've tried upgrading, cause we all want the supposed "best" no? I've tried Dynaudio BM15A's, Mackie HR824's (MK1 & MK2) and I keep coming back to these and returning the others. I will say, the new Mackies are awesome but the bass is just way too much for a "half-space" setup, meaning a setup where there's a wall right behind your speakers. The room acoustics need serious treating due to the Mackies low end response and that costs thousand in serious bass trap to fix the problem. I don't have this problem with the Behringers, yet I still have great tight punchy low end, just not as low as other brands go. In all honesty though most consumer listening sources don't have a good accurate sub 50hz response anyway.
I don't know what else to say about them. I mean, they're flat, they're super accurate, they're super inexpensive, and I've had mine for 7 years and they're still going strong. Your mileage may vary of course so you're on your own. But after all this time I thought, "Why didn't I ever write a review? After all this time I think I have something valuable to contribute".                
These are basically Behringer's knock-off of the Mackie 824 active monitors. The Mackie 824 is an incredible sounding monitor with a true 3D stereo depth that words cannot quite describe. This is why the go for $630.00 each!! When I was looking for monitors I compared the Mackie 824s to the Behringers quite closly, switching back and forth between them for many days, listening to a number of different tracks. I kid you not when I say days. Although the Mackies are marginally better and I emphesize the word "magrinally", I went with the Behringers. These monitors are basically the exact same sound you will get from the Mackie 824. Only on a select number of tracks did the Mackies outshine the Behringers and only for a few seconds. The price difference is not justified considering that you can get a pair of Behringers for half the price of 1 of the Mackies. I have owned them for 5 years with no problems what-so-ever. Behringer is an amazing company that churns out amazing products at amazing prices.                 
Same as the Mackie 824

They are still kickin ass after 5 years. Even if they were to blow out today I consider it a good use of my money                
Great sound! Really clear, phat basses, nice hi range. very dynamic. Sometimes more bass than what you figure....Low EQ graciously!                
VERY customizable. The switches on back let you tweak it to your studio environment.                
Plug-and-play...what more can you ask for?                
At 33lbs each...these things are BEASTS! They feel pretty solid, just like their sound.                
At $339 you can't beat them! Excellent for the small studio. If you are doing electronica...these will deliever!                
Never had to use their customer support...shouldn't have to if they are good :)                
These things scream "I'M GONNA RIP OUT YOUR EARS" sitting on my desk. Obey and love the Truths!                
I am very pleased with these monitors. Rich, clean sound, very accurate. Sexy looks. Great!                
They work amazingly for my setup.  If I were going to upgrade my speakers, I'd have to upgrade my room first!  I've had them for about 4 years now and have used them heavily.  They've been solid.                
Unbeatable for the price.  Power-save feature's threshold is a little too high for casual listening sometimes, but for studio work it's never a problem.                
If you can't get these working, you probably have no chance with music.  Plug, and play.                
They've survived a move from my parents house into my own house without any problems, and have endured a lot of careless power surges during power-up and power-down.  The one was attacked by my cat, and the foam around the woofer got slightly sliced, but after I carefully repositioned the tiny V-shaped slices, it hasn't effected the sound at all.                
Yeah, you can't beat the price.  If they were twice as much, I'd consider other brands.  I've been unimpressed by some of Behringers' other products, but these speakers can't be beat for the price.  Most people won't be able to notice much difference when comparing to much more expensive speakers.                
The design is beautiful.  They mean business.  My friends are lined up to buy them when/if I eventually move on.                
I just bought the matching subwoofer unit for these.  If something were to happen to them, I would replace them with the same item.                
I would imagine there are more accurate monitors available at many times the price but accuracy can really only be measured using rather elaborate equipment to compare a sample input vs. output.  I am not going to buy such equipment to tell mean what the variance from accuracy is detectable.  However, I can tell how good a monitor
produces sound that is satisfactory to my human ears and I must say these monotors sound very good to me.  They sound as good to me as many of the very expensive monitors.                   
The monitors have some adjustments for room acoustics in the back which is fine with me.  I don't think automatic room acoustic adjustments are really necessary.                
A breeze, plug them in and turn them on.                
I have used these monitors for over two years with no trouble or detectable degradation of sound.                
From my experience, there is no other monitor available which is such a great value.  I believe it is worth significantly more when compared to the competition.                
I have never needed any support so I can not rate it.                
I own a pair of these and have no thought about buying another brand.  Since they have been in regular use for two years, if one of them fails, I would by another of the same if available.                
I can safely say these are great monitors at a great price.  I suspect there are others available at a much greater price, but why spend more money if you are satisfied the what you have.                
 I own two pair, so I have the same ears at both studios I play in. You can get great mixes that sound good everywhere                
you listen, how hard can that be. It takes a little time to get your ears used to them, but just listen to your favorite cd's for a little while.                
they are built like tanks, just recently survived a fire, covered in black soot and a 1000% humidity, cleaned them up and they work perfectly                
for the dollar you just cant get a better monitor, you have to spend more than twice the price, just to get a LITTLE better sound                
never needed them                
they look great                
like I said before, I own 2 pair. with the money I got from insurance, I could have bought almost any monitors, but I still chose to get another pair, and donated my old ones to a friends studio                
I couldn't be happier with the sound. Everyone here seems to notice that these puppies stand out in the crowd of studio monitors. As with all monitors the secret to getting good mixes is getting used to the monitors, the way they sound. These monitors are very easy to get used to. The first thing I had to learn was leave the bass alone. If it punches through on these monitors it will sound fine on anything. They might even be a little bass rich... but there is an adjustment switch to control that on the back panel. I just left it in the normal spot... because like I said, it is very easy to get used to.                
Features??? C'mon... it's a powered monitor. It has balanced inputs, 1/4" and XLR, which makes them versitile. Our drummer uses them to power his sound onstage when he uses his electronic kit in a small room gig. Makes his V-Drum kit sound great.                
Plug 'em in and go.                
Built like a tank. I still handle them with care though... no rough housing here. The only stress test I give them is sometimes we rehearse in my studio and we all plug into the board and the Truths are the only sound re-inforcement we use. We do a rough mix and play through them. A cool way to practice. These babies will certainly fill up a small room. Loud enough to get the wife complaining about the volume.                
Best deal on the market... you have to dump $800 to get anything comparable. Although Alesis has come out with a powered monitor in this price range, I'm curious to how it stands up against the Truths.                
Don't need any.                
They are the heart and soul of my studio... BACK OFF!!! You can't have 'em.                
I can't imagine looking for a replacement for these. I love the sound, I'm used to how they sound. I'm getting great mixes the first time now, instead of going back to the mixing board over, and over, and so on. What I love about them, is I can turn the volume very low to hear how everything is sitting in the mix and then I crank them up to check the bass and the mix is perfect, everything balanced and being heard when the bass starts saturating the room. That's how you know you have good monitors. If you can't get the mix right with the volume real low... chuck 'em out the window. If you are losing too much mid's with the volume down or highs or whatever then you can't get a good mix. The Truths don't lie to you. Excellent pair of speakers.                
The B2031A monitors come as a matched pair. Left and right placement doesn't matter as they were manufactured symmetrically to each other. The sound is clear, transparent, very flat and translatates to the outside world perfectly if mixed correctly. They sound like studio headphones but not on your head if that makes sense. Great imaging...good bottom end...crisp and smooth highs...large "sweet spot". I use them to mix/master all genre of music. 90% of the music I track and mix is R&B...hip hop/rap. But I also sample metal...rock...country....blues....electric...classic...oldies..etc. These monitors deliver on what ever you can throw at them and reproduce it flawlessly.                
The most useful features I would have to say are the room compensation switches on the back of the monitors. Monitors twice this much didn't consider these features. So even if you were to find a better monitor (at 3 times the cost), if it didn't feature adjustment settings for you to taylor the sound...guess what? Yep, you've wasted your check (for some) on a monitoring system that want translate well for you. The only exception to this is if you have a PROFESSIONALLY sound treated room for monitoring. I don't mean a few bass traps or foam pads on the wall..I mean the works down to insulation behind the walls!! These B2031A monitors let you adjust the settings based on your surroundings and that's woth their price alone....very thoughtful Behringer. These monitors are heavy if you've read that in other posts...that's true. But I like that about them...the won't get knocked over easily and their build quality is awesome. They look nice and very intimidating for those times you want to show off for the artists you're working with. I've not a single problem with them and most importantly they get the jobb done.                
Pretty simple to set the TRUTHS up. Be sure you use BALANCED cables with the TRUTHS to avoid any possible noise. They accept XLR or TRS inputs both of which are balanced by the way. I'm running a Mackie 402-VLZ mixer which utilizes the 1/4 TRS inputs.....no noise at all. Very clean and tons of gain available. Just plug into you mixer or audio interface and you're mixing/mastering in no time. Can't get much easier.                
QC from the manufacture is a job well done. No flaws have bee found...they work as stated and they sound great! They feel very sturdy and well built....I'm sure these will be in my studio for years to come. I use them weekly for hours on end and they keep screaming like champs! Once you register them you get a 3yr warrenty so its a win win for you!!                
This product I can honestly say is worth its value plus some. You get great features and value you'd have to pay 3x as much with other brands.                
Haven't had to contact the manufacture and don't think ill need to any time soon...BUT if I do ill be sure to post the experience and details for you.                
This product will appeal to producers, musicians, artists, and engineers all the same. The value is what catches your eye but the performance will blow you away!!                
If you are reading this review I'm sure you've read a ton of others trying to select the best reference monitor for the money. We've all heard and read the horror stories about Behringer products...yes I was thinking just like many of you and almost made a bad mistake. Zzounds does their research too and these B2031A monitors are built at specs 3 to 4 times there value!! I took the leap of faith, purchased these monitors and All I can say is-look out competition! I'm just like most musicians and we all know that money is very scarce, so making wise purchase choices is vital. I've looked at, researched, listened to and compared several of the other competitors: KRK...Mackie...Alesis...Adams...Yamaha...even the super expensive "Gens". Save your Money and let the "TRUTH" set you free from all the headaches I had doing all this research. I work closely with a local producer that was sponsored "$$$" with nearly all of his equipment. He's had the KRK rokit 8 and the Yamaha NS 10 monitors for over 5yrs now. He knows those monitors very well after that long of experience with them...my TRUTHS came in about a month ago and I called my producer friend over to help me remix some songs I'd previously done on head phones (I know....never mix on headphones right!?!? Google me at: SOLO Production Squad for more reading). Once we cranked up the TRUTHS they blew us away...literally!! These beast move some air and get crazy loud! The bottom end is definitely there and not exaggerated like I read in some reviews, the highs are crisp, transparent and not harsh. The monitors are very "FLAT" and that's what they should be. We mixed two songs while he was over and we could not believe how good these monitors sounded compared to his more expensive setup. We rendered the two songs down to mp3 to see how well the monitors translated to other systems. We played them on the PS3, Xbox, Mac book, DVD player, an old disc man...even in the car while we drove back to his studio. After the 20 minute drive, we get to his studio...pop in the CD...WOW just as we mixed it at my studio!! Perfect TRUTH. He ordered a pair on the spot! Sorry for the long post my friends, but I figured it would be best if you read one long review oppose to thousands of short ones that don't help you. I almost feel into that hype off monitors, but trust another researching addict....don't let the TRUTH miss the space they deserve in your studio setup. We've all heard it growing up and normally its true.."You get what you pay for"....yeah I get that and I understand it, BUT I will say this, when you get more for what you've spent doesn't that change the entire saying?!?! Behringer went over and beyond on this particular product...the compensation switches on the back proves they took time to get this one right. Plus giving a fair fight out among the competition is where it made the difference for me. Sometimes when you spend more you really aren't getting better...you're paying for the name plate on the product...its a smart approach called marketing. Can't knock the business aspect, we all have to profit to survive, but the TRUTHS stayed true to the actual value to product ratio and delivered the world a wonderful monitor system for real worl musicians....Thank you Behringer and zzounds for making my dream a reality I could afford and for others like myself that don't have sponsors "$$$".                
I bought a pair of Roland DS-90's about four years ago and have been using them up until recently.  They were medium priced at the time (about $800 a pair).  I always had a difficult time getting the bass mixed right with those monitors.  Strange, but true, I'd have to go listen in my car on my stock, cheap stereo to assert the mix.  On a whim I decided to try these monitors.  ...I'm very impressed.  What took me 20-something mixes in the past is taking 3 or 4 now.  These are very accurate studio monitors.  All you need to do is listen to a reference track and then mix!  DONT let the price fool you.  I know there are more "accurate" monitors out there.  However, for the price, it's impossible to go wrong buying these things.  What can I say... I always said I'd never go 'on the cheap' but these things are such a pleasant surprise to me I have to say who cares!!                
The back of the monitors have switches to adjust to the room.  I've left them to the default setting (flat).  So not a lot of bells and whistles but one should look for accuracy in a studio monitor- not features.                
Very impressive...  These are accurate speakers.  Yeah, I'm certain if one spends a lot more you'll get good stuff.  But man... for the price it's not possible to beat these things.                
I haven't tried everything but I have compared these to a pair of monitors that cost over twice as much (monitors I own).  These monitors have saved me an extensive amount of time- and that equals money.                
No idea.                  
I'll use the word "impressive" again.  I can't give them a 10 because I know there are better studio monitors out there.  However, if I rated these on a price/performance ratio they would be a "10"                
From about 500hz and up it sounds great. Very flat, very balanced, fine detail, in other words high quality that you would expect from speakers much more expensive.
At about 150hz it has quite a peak (system resonance) which makes the sound a bit boxy. From about 150hz it goes downhill. At about 100hz the output is very weak. Below 90hz the reflex port resonance becomes active and makes sure you have a decent basskick sound.
The problem in lack of the higher bass is typical for this kind of small monitors with high pretentions. Reflex port is tuned too low which results in a dip in output between the speaker and the port. You cannot have it all. If you tune the port higher you won't hear a lot under about 60-70hz. The size of the monitors is simply too small for flat big sound.
I tweaked mines with a parametric equalizer. Now the sound is quite flat till 40-50hz. The sound is absolutely great.
Compared with a Alesis Mk2 passive the truth comes out a lot better. Where the Alesis sound agressive (the have quite a peak at around 5.000Hz and below 400hz they fall) the truth sounds very balanced.                 
Go and buy it. For this kind of money it is probably the best.                
I only miss real balanced bass. For this we need something a lot bigger and a lot more expensive.                
after only 30 minutes of shopping around online, I found zzounds! they were very helpful in completing my order, and the pay as you play option is a big deal breaker for me! needless to say. zzounds will be my only supplier in music gear.. I have bought the NI maschine- Behringer studio monitor speakers and the Komplete audio 6 usb interface! and I haven't been disappointed yet!  keep up the good work guys! and I cant wait to continue doing business with you for years to come! I accidentely gave the overall 4.5 stars but couldn't change it.. it should read 5 stars.                
The mids the highs sound great, maybe there is to much bass, but you can ajust that on the Monitors themselves.  The stereo image on these beasts is kick ass!  I would say these sound as good as 1000 dollar Monitors!                
being able to adjust for room accoustics is a big plus.                
very durable! I have them on seaker stands so there is no problem with the monitors being wobbled or moved or something.                
for the price I paid these are more then worth it!  the SOund sounds lush and full great mids and highs, maybe have to adjust the base but hey it's there if you have to.  They have a great wide stereo image.                
I like Behringer's products and I have delt with there support once they were great!                
they look very sexy tilted towards me and in back of my desk here...yes very sexy monitors!                
I really think that I will be using these Monitors for a long time.
there durable, sexy, and sound great with a wide and full stereo image.  They look great on my set up.                
Care is needed to faithfully follow the setup instructions in the manual.  Very versatile with many settings to mold the speakers to the room environment.  These will definitely give you the truth if you let them.  I also own the big 15" Tannoy studio monitors (my reference) and 6 other pairs.  For studio work, nearfield, one on one, these are very hard to beat.  Amazing for the price.  Bass begins at 50 hz, but I would avoid a sub as it's not necessary.  Enjoy!                
I have only had these monitors a couple of months, but let me tell you they sound and look great and would be bangin in any studio.I like the fact that you can crank these babies up and trust me theyll take the heat.when you here about monitors that do this and that and dont deliver,theyre not talking about behringer. I am a true fan and owner of these magnificent monitors. thank you behringer and zzounds for making my world a little bit better.............                
Great all round sound, tweakable to suit the room and style of music.                
The various knobs for tweaking are extremely useful.  The LEDS on the front are also a very good feature, especially the clip LED.  The extra hard and heavy casing creates a solid monitor that will last a long time.  Should have blown one of them by switching on a condensor mic on close to full gain.  A terrible thud and all the LEDs went off.  Thought I was done for.  Opened it up, everything was intact, reconnected it and LEDs came back on and sound came through...whew!!!  That means reliable!                
Excellent quality.  My experience with Behringer is that their speakers and power amps are very good and very reliable.  You have to be selective about their processors and mixers.  Touch their digital mixers at your own risk                
The best value for money around.  Price does not mean quality...as they say at Behringer "Just Listen".  I would bet that if Mackie were to house the same Behringer technology in these babies, they would sell for tripple their current price!                
Never had to use them                
Definitely a figure 8 woman!  And she don't need a grill on her to make her look better!                
Very long time.  If something went wrong, I would replace with the same product.  As for the issue of RF interference, guys pay for the right cables and observe the rules of laying out your cables. Don't bring your cell phones into the studio.  It has never been an issue for me                
These monitors were purchased for my wife to listen to music on her iphone. They deliver superb sound with out cloudy tones. Performance gets an A plus do to the no stop abuse at high volume with out missing a note.                 
These sound as good as more expensive monitors I listened to in the store where I bought them.                
Only downside -- The amplifiers amplify any FM carrier that
may be present on the AC mains. A better EMI/RFI filter on the
AC input would help out. I added one externally, which quieted the
signal, but I'd expect that to be built in.                
Sound as good as monitors twice their price.                 
Haven't had any need for support.                
These just plain work and work well. Who doesn't want that? If I could afford it, 
I'd have a pair in every room.                
I'd buy another pair if I had the money!                
Very Good,mids and highs were alittle too strong.Easily fixed with adjustments on back.Good bass,no need for subwoofer.Did pick up a hint of radio interference but was able to fix it.                
There are adjustments on back so you can tune them to your room.They worked well.                
Quality looks very good. They are heavy.No grills on front.                
Blown away for this price range,Outstanding!                
Have not needed support.                
Look Great.                
Will fulfill my sound needs fine.Pleasantly Surprised!Brought a tear to my eye!                
I rate it a 10 because the sound I hear and the sound from my headphones are the same.  Very important when mixing down.  My mixes have been "Perfect", this is to say when played through car stereo, boom boxes, radio play, etc. all sound the way I would like to hear.  I've used these monitors for over the last 3 years and absolutely no problems.                
Features are all on the back, room location, volume, enhansement. etc. to customize location.                
For the price, definately the best                
Dollar for dollar, can't beat the value                
All my Behringer products have not had one single problem                
As good as anything out there                
I'm actually so satisfied with this product I don't even consider looking for new.                 
Very quick, sharp, very full. They were right next to my very large main PA speakers and while sound checking my 'booth' speakers someone commented on the sound quality thinking they were the main PA.                 
N/A, except for good input control on speaker.                
Great, solidly made with no nonsense.  (although no grill). Looks like it should last for ever. Drops a point for on the road use. The casing is wood and will look tired very soon. I will be making some sort of casing for mine for road use.                
seems very well priced. They do not advetise like some other companies I could mention do.                
n/a..not needed so far                
looks the business, and is.....street cred intact.....                
great sound, very big and defined, well made. Only negative is no grill option, and for road use wooden finish                
Sound quality is fairly flat, the upper frequencies are a bit unusual and take some time getting used to.  As far as mid-range and bass is concerned, pretty accurate, and that did surprise me.  These things are LOUD even at it's lowest setting.                
You basically can adjust the frequencies to conform to the room.                
Plug and play... I kept everything flat on the back settings.                
I'm giving it a seven at the moment..  I just got these and they feel sturdy, look sturdy and even sound good.  But it's behringer.                
Undoubtably the best value out there.                
n/a but behringer is good about warranties..                
yeah, these speakers are staying put I like them.                
I have a pair of Yamaha HS80M's and although they are more accurate they are about $300 more.  Behringer came through for my A/B referencing against them for a fraction of the cost.                
The sound is actually very, very good.  I gave it an 8 because I haven't heard all of the monitors in this price range, and there are only a few with similar specs and price, I mean like two or three.  The highs are crisp and airy, but not hollow while the 8.75 inch woofer pounds out the lows if they are called to do so.  High quality flat, flat sound, I mean it sounds good w/o an eq. I heard everything like I should.  Iv'e made a 3 track (rythem acoustic guitar, bass guitar, and synth drum) medley to test the waters, I was very accurate from my car stereo to my living room stereo.  If you have a studio, and are not trying to keep up with they Jonses, these are the ones to get.                
All of the features that all the other monitors costing 4 times more have.  And they actually make a difference when I switch them.  I listen to Donald Fagen (originally from Stealy Dan)_ His music is good, but I mainly listen to his recorded sound as a reference for me.  He does his own stuff.  ANYWAY, the features leave nothing to desire on these monitors.
Keep your high end, price inflated brand names, these will more than get the job done.                 
Plug n play, what can I say?                
Built to last, thick dense fiberboard, and metal amp. cage, big transformer, and  clean soldering work with a minimal vibrating enclosure, just like the ad says.                  
I would have paid 400.00 for these.  Everytime I turn them on, I can't beleive how little I paid for them.                  
Haven't needed it                
Very atractive speaker monitors.  Smooth lines and solid looking                
I plan to have these for a long time, in fact, Im thinking of getting a pair for my theater system, and getting rid of all that 5.1 stuff.                
Great stuff they have Room compensation switches, Input trim power,Low and High frequency adjustable switches- everything to give you the truest possible sound- smashing!                
The Quality is Exellent these things are very well made and are durable taboot! Very good looking in my opinion too. Which is great!                
I paid                 
These monitors simply do not lie.  They are dead flat, and accurate to the point of painful, with a poorly mastered track.  I've toyed with the settings on the rear, and even boosting/cutting sounds, they're still simply dead flat.  They are worth FAR more than what they're listed for.                
Generally speaking, I don't like monitors that have a lot of "toys", but the tools on the back of these are a simple necessity for different studio environments.  I also quite like the auto power off, to save energy.  It's a bit too sensitive for my liking, but I quickly found the sweet spot to keep them on at a lower volume.                
You hook them up, they play.  They play beautifully.  Now, that said, take some time to set them up properly and you'll be positively amazed at the sound quality.  They come with a rather extensive manual.  Take a few minutes to read thru it.  It's worth your time.                
Everything is flush and firm on these.  They are BEASTS, at about 35 lbs each.  There's no rattle from the woofer, the bass ports are properly curved to stop excessive resonance and wind noise.  I'd like an option for grilles, but honestly, I don't need them.  I likely would not use them on the road, but if treated well, I'm sure you probably could.                  
Is there an 11 rating?  If there were, these would earn it.  You'll not find another monitor in this price range that even begins to come close to the quality of these.  
If you want big room, huge bass sound, these are not for you.  These are professional monitors, to be used as TOOLS in a studio environment.  Properly set up and used, you absolutely won't be disappointed.                
I've dealt first hand with Behringer a few times.  I've been constantly impressed by their attentive and fast customer support.  I had a mixer of theirs, long ago, that was out of warranty and I needed parts.  They not only had them in stock, they shipped them Priority Mail for free.                
They're beautiful.  Enough said.                
Honestly, for my use, I can't see buying other monitors unless something unforeseen happens to these.  However, they're built like tanks, so I can't really see that happening.  If I lost these, I'd buy another pair in a heartbeat.                  
This pair is my first active speakers. The bass is punchy. High is very sharp. Overall is outstanding.                
It seems to me features are pretty standard along with other active speakers. The most useful is the auto off feature.                 
Plug it in and play. Very easy to use.                
QC is not good. One speaker is more signal sensitive than the other one. Every time I turn off the power, one speaker has a loud "pop" while the other has only slight "pop". It is the QC problem.                
For the price, the sound is very good.                
Not sure. Did not contact the manufacturer. I did not contact Zzound which is the best in handling the return process.                
The appearance is fine. Not really outstanding.                
Overall is decent. Not a great speaker. You get what you pay for. The major drawback is the QC. You can see the difference between the two speakers.                
Great value for price. I use them with a Behringer sub to compensate for low end. I've been using them for 2 years without any problems. Then I moved to Chicago and they started picking up some hispanic AM radio station. Very disappointing. And yes, I use only balanced connections and PROEL cables.                 
Depending on where you live/work it can work as a great AM radio!                
Looks solid and professional.                
These are basically everything you want in a monitor. The clarity is comparable to a monitor five times the price and 100 times the hassle in setup and tuning time. Although they are similar to the Mackie HR824 in many ways, as cited in another review, I believe they were actually modelled after a much better, much more proven monitor, the Genelec 1032A. This is the monitor of choice in most recording studios with small format rooms. I am a professional engineer and producer for many artists and labels in Canada and I prefer the sound of the TRUTH B2031A to the Genelec or the Mackie any day. The EQ is perfect for heavy rock and electronic, and dirty acoustic tracks shine through wonderfully. I did have a problem with a slight dip in gain around the 150Hz range when working in a smaller 10x12' room, but most of this is due to the more absorbent rear wall of the studio. When working in a well balanced room, vocals especially astound me with information I didn't previously hear on the facet mounted Genelec system.                
XLR, BAL or UNBAL 1/4" inputs, Standard power cord, more features than any other monitor in its class, durable, I took them on the road last month, they accidently spent a few hours in -20'C weather, warmed them up and they were fine in an hour! Huge power reserve, hey... put em in your car and rattle the windows.                
They work great set up vertically and the sweet spot is found easily. I left the notch/shelf/pass filters all in their normal/neutral position and just plugged them in. I ran a few tests comparing them to the farm of monitors available at my studio, including the installed Genelec system, Yamaha, Mackie, Tannoy... and they really blew my mind. You really just plug them in, and have a listen, anything wrong will be appearent, and there is enough control for adjustment to fit your room. Set up on a horizontal axis (just out of curiosity) they were still the best bang for the buck. Mids had to be notched a little, and the sweet spot was much smaller, but they aren't recomended for horizontal use anyway.                
again, very durable. When they say 'matched pairs' they mean it, no difference from left to right at all. The break-in period was about two days of casual use mixing piano, flute, electric guitar, and percussion.                
Its Behringer, you're always getting twice the quality product you paid for.                
I havent had a problem at all with these, but I know Behringer stands behind their products. They've gotten a bad wrap as being cheep quality / lower grade... just because they decide to put their best into their products, but not charge you an arm and a leg for it. I use an MX9000 Mixer on the road exclusivly.                
it looks just like a Genelec 1032A at first glance, but I would say its even better looking. I bought a pair after using them for only two hours in another studio.                
Great monitor, and if you cant afford these, or just have a smaller mixing room and need a smaller monitor, I've heard great things about the smaller TRUTH B2030A. You wont be let down. I expect to use these for many years to come.                
I heard these at my buddy's studio and was very impressed with their sound. When I found out what they cost....I came right here and scooped up a pair of my own. Two days later they were delivered! Stupid fast shipping to upper left coast!!!                 
I havent listened to them yet                
The b2031a are new, it is basically the b2031 with minor improvements, I have contacted Behringer, some improvements include
A)B2031A's have magnetic shielding to protect against interference from computer monitors
B)B2031A's have a more easily accessed power switch (on top, instead of underneath power input connector on originals)
C)B2031A's use polypropylene diaphragm woofer - B2031 use polycarbonate. PP supposed to be more resilient...
No more info is available untill they hit the stores.                
I would wait to get these. If they went through the trouble of upgrading the b2031, then it must be better, they don't upgrade just for fun.                
Sounds really great, just don't play it too loud while mixing "Fatigue". I still haven't put them to extreme use as yet... but I like what I'm hearing now...                
I like the auto-power switch on the back, room compensation beautiful to adjust the speakers to your studio size.                
You just plug 'em into your mixer and you are set to go. No hassles.                
Probably the only short-coming in this department is the fact that the woofer is exposed and as such can easily be damaged.                
This is value for money. I paid N$ 5000 that's about U$ 400.                
These are great for what I know of them and have lots of quality and dimension to them. I can't tell if they grew on to me or I just wore the drivers in enough because I didn't really care for them at first. I've been listening to them all day and they're finally starting to rub off on me. I did have to change the switches the back alot. The best setting I got were as follows: lowfreq=0 roomcomp= - 4 and high=0. I've owned KRKs, genelecs, NS-10s, Mackies, etc and these can compete. IDK how they translate yet, because I've only heard the same mix I did on the 2031a's through the new iphone 5 buds but there not bad just a little muddy in the low end (which can always be fixed with a dip around 40-80hz). And yes some people mix, yes MIX on the iphone buds, IMO they are this generations average bookshelf monitor.  I made my first beat on these and sold it for 200 not knowing how they would translate "0" but the person I sent it to was in Boston, I was in LA, and he said the mix sounded great!! So i guess they did translate well to his system whatever he was using. BUT I was using Waves and McDSP plugins and was referencing the final master of the compilation to 50 Cents Get Rich Or Die Trying album, comparing and tweaking my beat to make it sound closest to the way 50s album did. And it worked, my beat sounds great I can believe it sounds so professional. I keep listening to it over and over! Whoever said it dosent translate good can eat dirt. I'm a pro and I have done 1000s of mixes on 100s of different systems. I have to tell you tho...Ray Charles and The Beatles sound amazing through these after listening to them all day. Remeber I'm going from my TRS interface to the XLR inputs on the Beringers. I bought these $150 pair used. So it was definitely worth it IMO and I made my money back plus 50 bucks for 1 mix. I really really really wanted to get a pair of Focals tho, but these will do for now until I get those. Again I got a steal for 150 used on Craigslist! The signal is coming from my alesis io26 ( which has awesome A/D , D/A converters. Let me say the Alesis IMO is up to quality as my old apogee duet 2 IMO and shimmerzzzz). But back to the B2031a's they sounds pretty good and NO fatigue. I've literally been working with them all day and the more I listen to them the better they sound. IDK how, but its scaring me. I honestly thought they were junk at first. The guy I picked them up from said they were sitting around for a while so at first after hearing how thin they sounded I decided to put a couple towels over each speaker and bumped some 50 cent and Eminem pretty loud, while I went out, so I would wear in the drivers. That seemed to help a bit. What really truly helped was sitting there listening through all types of high quality 320kbps mp3s getting used to and learning the speakers. I just got them yesterday and it took me a the whole day to learn these 2031A's, and thats pretty crazy because I'm a professional engineer and I NEVER have to "learn" monitors. I guess these just have to be taught to you. But I really do kinda love them now and I would buy them again if I could. 
So to sum these up these are great speakers, they sound like garbage when you first get them, but don't throw them away. Listen over and over and learn them. They will bring great results and you'll fall in love. 1 more thing the low end is pretty quite, but it could be my mixing position, but I recommend a sub if you can afford. I dont have one but it still sounds great!                
I can't believe it sound better than headphone alot(pro heahphone). I can head anythings clear.the best studio monitor. I went to many stories to test the sound from many brands but I did not like them all. I read the
review (Behringer TRUTH B2031A Monitor) and falling love with. good sound good price.                
must include pro speaker cable.                
plus and play.                 
look sexy for me                
good deal and good price.                
I hope the service will be good.                
sexy baby to have.                
I'll buy them again if they get old.                
These are great sounding monitors! I checked them with several CD's that I know well and the reproduction and stereo imaging are excellent. You can hear everything very clearly. The amps are really quiet and monitoring at low levels yields great results as well.                
Lots of switches to compensate for room acoustics and monitor placement. Several people have mentioned that they run the 2301's at 
-2db on the treble because they are so bright. I didn't feel this was necessary on the 2301A's.                
Seems to be very well made. They're solid and pretty darn heavy too.                
Excellent "bang for the buck!" Especially for the 8 3/4" woofer and 225 watts of power per speaker.                
The warranty gets sent back to Germany. Got to wonder if it will be a hassle getting in touch. I have had a Behringer mic pre-amp for over a year with no problems so I don't expect I will have to use support.                
The 2301A's are a great addition to my set-up. Good looking, nice materials, and well-made. From the pictures I thought they were dark grey but they are actually black.                
I'll keep these for a while. They are a great value and very accurate/neutral sounding. I'd love to have another passive pair for my stereo. Compared to the other monitors I've been looking at in this price range they are unbeatable!                
These are the best monitors in their price class by far. You have to go above $1k per pair to get any better. The sound is smooth, accurate and detailed, although I did find that slight changes in placement made big differences in the accuracy. You'll have to fool with the positioning a bit but once you get it right you'll be amazed with the sound of these speakers.                 
What accessories do you need with powered monitors? Power cords and signal cables. These come with power cords but not signal cables because obviously one cord won't fit all users' needs.                
Plug 'em in, turn 'em on and go. It doesn't get much easier.                
Incredible for the price is all I can say.                
Value-wise these are actually a 20 but the scale only goes up to 10.                
Don't really know - haven't needed any support yet. I doubt if I will.                
These monitors bear more than a coincidental similarity to Genelec 1031A's and are therefore quite sexy.                
I can only tell you that I bought these monitors before I actually heard them, although I heard just about everything else in the same price range and I was elated when I finally heard them. They blew everything else away.                  
if you never heard really good studio stuff you might think these are studio quality . not for real studio install. these are lack luster monitors
decent features wish  they had auto repair as they blow after 1 year                 
not for mixing not for any thing but duffers                 
blew in a year                 
you get what you pay for                 
did not expect much . just gave them to charity when they blew  as the 1 year just exp.                
they look slick but  need real grills                
wish i would have had more to spend.  these behringers   truly  suck cant believe the reviews , who are these people who like these toys                
Comparing with the price these are great. sweet spot is broad and stereo image is excellent. You can turn up the gain to its highest position with no distortion or coloring. I test these speakers with sine wave with 10HZ intervals and the result was great. these monitors are FLAT. Ofcourse ther was a pick at 120HZ and a dip at 180HZ but these are my room rezonance. never under estimate room acoustics. Those who complains about the radio interference hvae problem with cabling I guess. Always use balanced cables for sound equipments.                
the controls on rear panel are very handy. and the limiter is accurate.                
Just plug and play.                
the cabinet looks cool. it's built like a tank.                
worth every dollar                
Ihaven't had any problem yet                
obviosly there are more accurate and expensive monitors out ther but for mu pocket these are the best.                
buy it and enjoy the quality of a high resolution studio monitors.                
good for price                
lots more than most will ever know what to do with                
plug and play                
this company needs better quality control.  some stuff is just junk, while other stuff you can't break.  my speaks are fine after 3 years even with the "buttons" pushed in by the one year old                
sound better than anything else close to the price.  will get mackies or adams when i can, but for now, it beats the headphones.                
just for price                
the radio/interference problems went away when i lifted the ground.                  
Ok, I'll rate it an 8 to not skew the average -- but before you buy this, please note the fact that they do not include a +/- db range for their claimed frequency response in any of their online documentation.  So, they could easily be basing their claim on a +/- of 5 or 6db, also known as "very colored".
I doubt any company releases a monitor (or any speaker) without having created a few frequency response graphs, so their reluctance to share the information with potential customers is a red flag to me.                
using with mixer with computer...sound great...don't have to match speaker with amp. they already done a great job.                
good power reserve                 
Had them almost 1 year , still pounding.                
just wrote a review after they blew in a year, the weak point is the lousy amps that are under powered and not sheilded, but before giving them  to a local church i turned into passive . wow what a difference when using a real crossover and good amps . even just passive with a 6 mfd cap on the tweeter they sounded great .
ok                  
bottom boomy highs dull . very good mids very neutral over all hard to bring out bass and treble with limted controls                
my exp with these may be isolated but the build seems poor, great am radio receivers, sound great passive                  
yes. but would  highly recomend the passive model                   
 poor cust support compared to other higher price co.s  i expected to just be able to order a new amp it didnt happen that way and they arent really worth fixing when its so hard to get replacement service parts                   
looks nice                 
would be afraid to buy another product from behinger because of they do not seem to hold up . you got to replace it couple years thats not value. would buy the passive model                 
SUPER!!

FOR THE PRICE...they're cool.  otherwise, any serious bass work and be prepared to experience port chuff.                  
good tweakability for a powered speaker of this price, and you can "dilute" port chuff by properly adjusting the frequency response of the bass on the rear, as well as attenuate the highs.                
BEWARE - CITY DWELLERS :  these monitors pick up radio interference, and they don't even have to be connected to anything...simply "ON".  this is probably a Behringer thing, i presume.   yes, they're heavy, but that doesn't mean they're "quality."  harsh highs is not a myth with these, but can be attenuated nicely with the high frequency response adjuster on the rear, set to -2db.  you're paying 340 for the pair, so what do you 'really' expect?                 
other than serious radio interference and port chuff, they do sound good...for the price.                
n/a                
n/a                
on a serious budget?  as long as you don't have high expectations and/or don't use these for serious engineering/mixing, you will be satisfied.  they definitely get the job done with a nice touch.  this seems to be a good studio monitor for the project studio on a budget looking to upgrade from more "consumer"/"pro-sumer" level speaker products.  i give it an overall 5:  because...if you experience it, the radio interference is a serious, serious let down.  renders them pretty much useless, and you will find yourself quickly utilizing the re-seller's 30-day guarantee.

They are called "Truth" , Well the truth is that they sound bad. The sound of these monitors can be best described as harsh and clinical. If you want to know what your mix will sound like out these in the real world,dont use Behringer monitors                
Features dont matter if the main thing - the sound - is bad                
Easy, plug them in and see for yourself                
Behringer quality, will it still work tomorrow ?                
You usually get what you pay for,but with these, you get less than what you pay for                
Support is as bad as the product.They do not want to hear from you.                
Thanks, but No Thanks                
Spend just a little bit more and get something else                
i don't know how useful this review will be to many who read this, as i don't mix music. i use the Truth's for listening to music i download onto my computer.
these speakers do get loud. the bass is solid if not slightly muddy. i listen to a lot of 70's fusion, and Prog Rock, and the experience is overall very enjoyable. the speakers tend to get a little bright at elevated listening levels, but i am sure that can be adjusted out. not enough of an issue for me to fiddle with right now.
another little niggle is that there is RF noise filtering through. more than likely because i opted for cheap audio chords, and the speakers are on my desk right now very close to my computer monitor. it's likely a quick fix will be to purchase quality cords and put the speakers on stands away from my monitor.                
these speakers are adjustable, and can likely smooth out any sonic rough edges. i have yet to tweak mine.
the 8 3/4 woofers and their 175 watt amplifiers are what these speakers are all about. Chris Squires thunderous bass lines are exactly that. a very powerful listening experience for near/mid-field speakers in this price point.                
getting them going out of the box was simplicity itself. but tweaking to find ones personal sweet spot never is. adjust, listen to a variety of material, adjust, listen to a variety of material, repeat as necessary. tweaking is never easy (at least for me).
but if the sound out of the box is right for you, then these speakers are plug-and-play.                
these speakers are SOLID. very well constructed, should hold up very well to hard use for a very long time.                
nice...i am very pleased with what i have received for my money. do recommend!                
i did not buy these speakers for sex appeal, i bought them because my M-Audio 40's were inadequate. these Behringers are actually overkill for my what i do with them. but it's comforting to know i would have to try really, really, really hard to hurt them. couldn't say the same for the M-Audios.
but as far as appearance...these are guys speakers, very beefy, with an almost sullen attitude about them. all black with little green eyes, there is nothing dainty about these speakers. actually they are kind of monolithic, and quite capable of turning your grey matter to mush. they are noticed wherever you place them.                
it really depends on how well i am able to keep things in perspective. because of how powerfully these speakers play, i am already considering an upgrade for my subwoofer, which will then require a speaker upgrade, and the madness just takes over.
but if i am able to remember these speakers are just for listening to music through my computer, then i will have them for a very long time.                
The sound of these monitors is super, 359.00 or 500.00.
The lows are well rounded and punch, while the highs are crisp, and true without being overbearing. (I have my tweeters set at -4 cause I m in a  10x12 bedroom.)
They do crank, but are really intended as a tool that I have come to find very useful.
The controls in the back allow me to tune the box to the room as I see fit.  I dont think there is any right or wrong way, seeing as every room is different as well as everyones definition of a "good sounding recording".
I am in the process of just expierimentation and tweeing here and there to find a sound I like with my giutar and keyboard.  f I need to compensate for sound somewhere, I have an EQ (also Behringer) that will take care of that.
Overall great sound.                 
This comes with all the bells and whistles I expect in a studio monitor worth recording with.
They include seperate tweeter and woofer output controls, as well as room compensation in case I use it in a corner of the room, which tends to make the bass boomy.
Also included is an auto off swicth which I leave on "on" and just switch them on every time Im gonna use them.  On auto, they turn off
after 5 min. if I play them at low levels.  not a problem. 
Controls:A+                
plug in, swich to "on", find your sound, and get after it.                
Built like a tank.
Very heavy, because of the big transformer and magnets thing thing has.
8 because the finish around the plastic plate arond the tweeter and woofer could be smoother.
Now if thats my only gripe, I think thats pretty good.
No radio sounds hear.  When there is nothing going through them, I have to walk up to them to make sure thier still on.                
269.00 + free shpg at MF new. nuff said.                
Dunno, never have called, or needed support.                
Well, I never thought of speakers having, sex appeal, and I've never had lust for equipment, but they are attrative and look professional.
I guess if they were hitch-hiking, I would pick these twins up!!!LOL
Overall, Georgous, smooth lines, good design, a real contender in the studio monitor market.                
Overall, I cant stop listening to these things, I have to listen to all of my music again to hear how they sound through these.
I recommend these monitors if you have a home studio for demos, or going for the gold.W
What you hear out of these seems to hold up to Behringers claims.                
They are amazing for the price !!! Almost "Mackie like". :-)                
Just plug and play                
VERY SOLID !!                
Weel worth the price                
Very easy to work with, very responsive                
I have three sets to include sub woofers                
Have had two of three sets for two years, they are still going strong                
THEY SOUND GREAT!!! YOU JUST HAVE TO AJUST THE SETTINGS IN THE BACK TO YOUR ears I HAVE A PARE OF MACKIES AND THEY SOUND BETTER THAN THOSE AND I ALLSO HAVE A PARE OF KRK ROKIT8'S THEY DONT HAVE AS MUCH BASS AS THE ROKIT8'S BUT THEY COME CLOSE BUT OVER ALL I GIVE THE BEHRINGERS A 10 IN MY STUDIO THEY GET THE JOB DONE.                
NO ACCESSORIES CAME WITH THEM ALL THE FEATURES ARE USE FULL.                
VERY EASE!!!                
VERY WELL!!!                
YES!!! THEY SOUND LIKE THOUSAND DOLLOR SPEAKERS.                
I purchased these speakers about 3 or so years ago. All was well until about the second year. One day, about a year ago the woofer of one of the pair began to pulse with some kinda power surge. The speaker was never the same since. The problem became progressively worse. Now after 3 minutes of play...the haunting pulse overloads the speaker and then goes flat line. it cost between $150 to $180 get one of these jokers fixed, so you see my dilemma. For what it's worth, if you have the money go with something that's built a little better. If funds are tight and you're looking for a decent sound the truth will do you well. In short these are "in the meantime" speakers they sound pretty good, but don't look to get any longevity out of them. In my experience they are the best bang for the buck, but that's just until that eminent final BANG!                
Sounds good and even. Not the best but for the price it's hard to beat.                
Plenty of features for a pair of speakers.                
Plug em in and go.                
Well built and a good design. I would give it a 10 (considering the price) but RF interference is a problem. Even without any cables plugged in it still picks up the radio. For most people it seems to work fine though so it looks like it depends on where you're located. Buy em if you're feeling lucky.                
Great value if they don't play the radio while you're mixing.                
Haven't contacted the company so they get a 10 because I imagine they'd be OK.                
I like the sound of these monitors, although they sound more like hi-fi speakers than studio monitors. The highs are a little too bright, and even with the attenuation switch for the highs maxed out it is still a little too bright. Also the bass could be a little tighter.                
All of the switches on the back of the monitors help with tuning the monitors to your room. It has all of the necessary inputs too. I don't like how the speakers "pop" on when in auto-on mode.                
Easy to use if you know what you're doing.                
I had no problems for the first year with these speakers, but it seems as soon as the warranty expired (knock on wood) the problems began. One monitor began humming at times. The other one suddenly burned out the power supply and an IC. The cost for repair was not worth it so I have decided to buy different monitors. If you look inside at the internal components of the amplifier and speaker boxes you will find that the quality is a little sub-par. Hot glue is spread everywhere, but for this price range I would say the quality is acceptable.                
These are a good value if you want some 8-inch monitors with the capability to reach low bass frequencies.                
Ok, these aren't the best monitors around, but what do you expect. I use them along with B2092A sub, and they sound great. Great response down to 180Hz, and the sub takes over from there. I've never heard any Radio interference, and I live in an area that doesn't have any FREE radio frequencies.                
Pretty much all of the features that you'd expect from studio monitors, right up there with monitors that cost 4x as much.                
Hmm, not sure if I've used anything that is LESS complicated. If you can't figure out how to use these in 5 min, then you should probably choose a different hobby/profession.                
No problems so far, and I've had them for about one year. I've used them both in my studio and also dragged them around for small house parties, and they still perform like new. They can definitely stand up to reasonable wear and tear (just don't drop them).                
Hmm, nothing in this price range with this much power and quality, so I guess that deserves a 10.                
Don't know, never had to use it.                
I use these monitors for recording and mastering DJ mixes, and so far I've haven't had any complaints. These are great monitors and definitely worth buying if you're on a budget (under $500).                 
Picks up an incredible amout of noise from the environment (radio stations, computer noise, etc.)  Since I got rid of the one setup that minimized it, they're now paperweights.
When that was under control, it's not great, but for the price, pretty good.  The low end lacks definition, the highs can be overly sibilant. I think they were going for cheap and bassy, which they achieved.  
Overall, though, you just can't have other &@#%ing radio stations playing through your monitors!                
About what you would expect.                
How hard could monitors be?  Other than trying to fix the quality (see below), nothing to it.                
Seem solid, no physical issues at all, seems like they would survive considable abuse.  I've been tempted.                
Obviously, since it's now useless to me, it has very poor value.                
I'll likely avoid Behringer in the future, and I wish I could go back in the past and avoid these.                
I am surprised how good these sound.
They actually sound good at lower levels too.
 I did switch the highs to -2db, but have not decided "yet"
 if it's the best setting. It's great to have controls to accomodate your control room.
For the bad news,
I was a bit bummed to see the cover lifting on the top right edge of one of the speakers. This is where Behringer QC fails.
The speakers sound so good, I'm questioning returning them for a new 'no blemish' set. They come in as matched pairs with a freq. chart.
I also own several other near field monitors including the Mackie HR824 which I paid 1600.00/pr. 
These honestly give Mackie a run for their money. Yes, I'd like to bad mouth Behringer, but I can't for what you get for the $ !!!
 I've always liked the Mackies, but man these sound good too.
Hmm.  339/pr....dang!  After picking these heavy mothers up and listening to them, it surprises how much you get for 339.
For whatever it's worth, I've been working in the music field for over 25 years and have a project studio in Phoenix, AZ                
Bass falling apart (literally! The woofer huffs and puffs) when connected to a Motif 8 and playing low piano notes at very moderate sound levels. May not be an issue if you listen to canned music and for some mixing work (though I'd have my doubts).                
Good range of features for what they are.                
Easy to use.                
The price of the components going into these speaker is ~$50 (each). The finish product performs accordingly. Might be good for some but it didn't work for me at all.                
I returned them. Great speakers are a wonderful joy to use. These won't buy you that.                
N/A                
Nope.                
My quest was simple: I wanted to amplify my Motif 8 and have it sound at about the same "quality" as my $30 Sony headphones. No way, Jose! Not with budget speakers. I went through varies speakers before learning that you have to shell out a grand to come close to that simple goal. This are probably good for listening to canned (condensed, already-mixed) music but don't make it as tool to produce music.
The only low-priced speakers I found that wouldn't produce physically-worrisome (and very audible) woofer movements/break-downs when playing low piano notes (or worse, accords) were the Alesis M1 Active mk2, but they very much color and smear.
They are exactly what you first might think before wishful thinking taking over: "Too good to be true."                
IF you just go and listen to these speakers, you will probably like them.  You will notice that they are very bright to the extent of feel too sharp with the high end. You will be stoked to hear all that detail, but let me remind you that hearing things that you mormally don't can equal innaccuracy.  That, I believe, is the case here. The EQ on the back helps but doesn't solve this issue.  BIG NOTE: just because they sound goo doesn't mean that your recorded projects will translate well. These are a bit frustrating to work with in that area. You'll always be compensating your mixes from these monitors to home stereo systems. They'll take some adjusting to for sure.  Because they are bright, you mixes will sound dull on other sound systems.  If you choose to master with these, go brighter than you think you should.                
Can't argue with all the input options, separate volume knobs, and room adjustment settings.  They're nice.                
As I said before, you get what you pay for with these as far as working with them goes.                
As an engineer, I do not push my equipment since I want to make both my gear and my ears last for a long, long time.  However, I blew out two tweeters within a year.  The first one was replaced for free, but the second was beyond warranty scope.  Not to mention payong shipping for these monsters both ways was not cheap.  As I'm becoming more familiar with different types of gear, I'm becoming a non-fan of Behringer in general.                
I would say that they are a good value for the money.  I would simply save up and buy better speakers (which I have now done).  If those tweeters don't start crackling on you, then you'll like them.                
Never dealt with Behringer.                
They look great - an obvious copy of Mackie HR824's (which I now own and use).                
Don't be fooled by people who say that they sound just as good as Mackie HR824's.  I can't imagine that these people have done actual projects with the two of them.  Yes, they sound good, but we're not using them for listening enjoyment here, we're mixing for the real world.  No, they don't mix nearly as well.  No, they're not nearly as accurate.  Yes, ear fatigue is a definite issue with these.  Yes, they have great overhead with the powerful biamps.  Yes, they cost about one fourth of the Mackies.  I'm not saying they're terrible or wonderful.  They are budget speakers.  Period.  I like them for what they are AND I would (and have) saved my money and bought monitors that I am much more content with.  If I could buy them again, I would not.  But then again, I just wanted to get things started in my studio and had a tiny budget to start out with so I bought inexpensive speakers - viola!
HERE'S A CLUE: these are entry level speakers. Take them for what they are.  The vast majority of the reviews that you read for these monitors are from people who have never done serious recording before.  Nor have they tried other monitors outside the store.  I started out with them quite happily.  Now with some more skill and experience, I moved up and gave them to my intern to work with at his home.  Seriously, if you had the budget, would you even be looking here?  You're just not going to copy Mackie monitors for 1/4 the cost.  It would be nice though!                
You get what you pay for.  These might be adequate for a home theater setup or something.  If you're serious about monitoring, no way.                
Features are a copy of the Mackie HR824.                
Pretty simple here.                
Cheap, cheap, cheap.  There is a GOOD reason that the Mackies cost four times as much.  They're four times as good.                
Gotta rate them high here.                
They'll get back to you by email eventually.                
If you're serious about getting good monitors, you do not want these.                
Save your money and get better monitors.                
This product compares 100% to the Mackie HR824's. Why spend all that money when you could spend less for the same sound. I owned both and sold the mackies and so did 4 of my friends. Don't be fooled by price; expensive is not always better. They sound great.                 
Excellent! Smooth and clean. Highs crisp without being harsh. Bass tight. Something no one else has noticed, the enclosures are VERY solid - which is why they're so heavy - and which is one reason why the bass is so good. Tap your knuckles on the side of one of these and you hear a high-pitched "whack" - try that on a Mackie and you'll hear a low-pitched "thud." And they play loud - I've had these cranked up way past the point where the red warning light blinked and so far no problems. The bass remains tight and the highs clean all the way.                 
One of the ones I was going to buy was dead when we hooked it up - not a good sign. Other people have commented on Behrenger's spotty QC - so beware. Also, I wish the speakers had some sort of protection for the drivers. Be careful when transporting.                
If I was told that these speakers sold for $600 I'd believe it. At $300 street price, they are a steal.                 
I like the way they look.                
I am VERY critical when it comes to sound and speakers in particular. I have owned speakers in the $2000 to $3000 for my stereo - and I am truly impressed with these.                 
Man! These things sound great.  We have mackie 824's at the studio and mackie has nothing on the behringers.  Everything stands out in the mix, it's almost like having a seperate speaker for each instrument.  Other monitors tend to slur everything together and end up sounding like home stereo speakers, but not these.                
There's all kinds of switches to tweak the sound.  I'm not going to list them here, download and read the manual at behringer.com                
When I got them, I was taking out one speaker and accidently dropped it on the floor.  Ooops.  No damage, I was more careful with the 2nd speaker.  These are very heavy speakers, not quite as heavy as my Marshall TSL100 head, but close.
To the idiot who claimed these pick up radio signals: BULL!  I live in NYC and I have no problems what-so-ever.  None.  Maybe you shouldn't buy you audio cables at radio shack, dude.                
I prefer these monitors over the mackies only because the mackies are too bass heavy and I end up compensating for this and the mixes are not as true (universally good sounding) as the behringers.                
I've never called them, never had to return anything, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, 10.  Their website is great; one of the best ones out there.  PDF manuals and huge JPG's for every product.                
Want it?  Hell, I already got it.                
The 2031a's sound fantastic, they're damn loud, true, and at $339 just blow everyone else away.  Brand name snobs diss these monitors all the time and usually without even hearing them, but that's because they paid too much and just ass-u-me high price means best quality.  It doesn't - just look at protools (blech) vs sonar & cubase.  I'll take sonar or cubase over that protools crap anytime.  If these monitors were priced the same as the mackies, I'd still rather get these.  Everything that behringer puts out isn't great, but these sure are.                
At first listen I was disappointed, because the highs were a little high for the room and the bass was a little muddy. So I moved them off my wooden desk and onto my futon to destroy any sympathetic resonance. WOW!! What a difference. They came to life. The imaging is better than anything I have heard in the under $700 range. Slightly better than the event TR8s, WAY better than the m-audios, tampas, rolands and everything else I have heard in that range. I work regularly on my partners set of HR824s and these are similar in many regards. They dont have the xtra bass that the Mackies do, but this can actually be a good thing. There is a little accentuation to the mid highs that isn't controllable by the switches in the back, and they seem to have a rather small sweet spot, but as a whole they are amazing, and I don't mean just for the price.                 
The adjustments on the back are essential for anyone who isn't EQing their monitors and wants to compensate for room abnormalities. I wouldn't have bought these if they didnt have that.                
all I can say is they are heavy. i have only had them 2 days, so i have no idea how durable they are. i do know the auto power mode on one of my speakers doesn't work, but I am turning them off when I dont use them anyways, so this doesn't really matter to me.                
It is rediculous that these cost so little. Guess it pays to have Mackie do all your research and development for you.                
They are sooooo sexy                
This is in relation to their cost. I would prefer the Mackies or a pair of KRK V8s, but I aint paying for the slight upgrade in sound quality. They are, for the money, the best monitors I have ever heard.                 
Very little noise. Goes loud. Great sound. Amping my seagull acoustic with an LRBaggs M1 Active and an AKG C300 mic. Perfect for "hearing myself" when composing/practicing my own material.                
OK the marketing materials that show you putting this on a stand with a boom are *stupid*. I didn't really believe it could make sense. I tired it. It doesn't work. Get a separate stand. 
Very, very nice *small* package. Very solid feeling. Smaller than I imagined, which made me happy.
Love that it has phantom mic power for my AKG C3000.                 
Super easy to use. "No Duh" front panel. Plug in whatever to the two mic/line inputs.                
It feels so solid. Could use just a bit more "polish" on the look and feel. The "Behringer" triangle on the speaker grill is a little bit crooked! EQ knobs could use just a little more "positive click" when centering the EQ.                
Price can't be beat. Sound is great. Super easy to use.                
Don't take this support ranking to mean much. I have a number of Behringer products (mixer, direct boxes)...never had a problem so I don't know what their support is like!                
Who wouldn't want this? I can think of so many times that I want amplification without breaking my back. This really is a go-anywhere unit. Wanted it when it was first announced...now I got it.                
I can easily see getting another of these to go with my 1204 mixer for a quick, cheap, easy-to-move system for fun gigs with friends - especially for getting the vocals out above the cacaphony!                
This is what you are looking for. 
It's crystal clear, loud as h---, and small. 
Each member of our band bought one and we are all thrilled. We don't even need our PA speakers for practices!                
1) I was considering a passive monitor but am I ever glad I got this with its EQ and volume! 
2) We all really like the way this monitor lets you attach your boom mic to the top of the monitor. Many other reviewers complain about this for some reason, but I don't know why. They supply you with sturdy attachments and two locking rings that allow you to adjust the the position of the boom exactly how you want it and then lock it tightly in place. Very clever design. (German—what do you expect?)
Here's my big p.o.:
Assuming you are in a band, and you want to connect more than one monitor ( we bought 3) to the other(s)...good luck figuring it out. My other band member and I took two evenings to figure it out! The manual is devoid of any information that explains how to connect more than one monitor. So I'll save you some grief and explain it now:
!)  To connect your PA to monitor: Plug chord into your PA's "Monitor" jack and to the "MIC/LINE 1" jack located on the front panel of your new monitor. This creates (what I will call) your Master monitor. This monitor's volume determines the minimum volume for all other "slave" monitors connected to it. (Note: each other "slave" monitor's volume can be individually adjusted higher (but not lower).
2) To connect Master monitor to a slave (2nd) monitor: First you have to buy a 3-Pin XLR Male to 3-Pin XLR Female Audio Cable. Plug in the female end into the "THRU" input, located at the back of the Master monitor and plug the male end into the "MAIN IN" input, located at the back of the slave monitor.
3) Repeat this connection method for other slave-toslave monitors.
IMPORTANT: Keep all the monitors' volumes set fairly high, (3/4 all the way or more). We had our monitors hooked up correctly but under-estimated the volume required, which resulted in no sound.
It's built like a German tank. No worries that it will hold up well.                
This is so cheap when you consider all you are getting. It's a little PA + a litle guitar amp + a little CD player...all in one, all at the same time.
I really recommend this high quality product. 
Before our band bought these monitors, we used to rent 3 big, clunky floor (wedge) monitors for $30.00 ea month! But these little Behringers are way better. This is the ffirst time in my 35+ years of playing that I can actually hear my voice midst the loud noise our band makes (and I play right next to our drummer!)
Just bought them, but highly doubt there will be any problems.                
I wouldn't even want to practice with my band without my Behringer. I am spoiled rotten now.
This deceivingly small monitor is all I ever hoped for.                
This is as important as my mic. It isn't a "nice-to-have" item. I would buy another and another if I had to. It's really that good.                
Amazing sound quality from a speaker that weighs less than any speaker I've ever used with this kind of clean, clear power.  From auditoriums to gymnasiums to outdoor venues, crystal-clear audio (and, at least in my experience, no unwanted echo!)                
Versatile, adaptable, with jacks to suit my needs and mics and I can set it on a shelf, on a microphone stand or a Camera tripod (which I use primarily).                
Plug and play.  Simple as that.  I'm in no way a tekkie or inclined to mess around with umpteen controls.  For the pro who wants that or the performer who wants to plug it in and get on with it, this is a winner.                
I'm a performer who likes to keep the costs down and the quality up.  This is the best value I have seen for a speaker with this kind of power and flexibility.                
Haven't had a need to contact the manufacturer.  The speaker is solidly built and will take a lot of abuse.  I know, because I work a lot, carry my own stuff, and I know a good speaker when I see one.  This is the best--well-built, lightweight, expandable.  What's not to like?                
Try it once and you will love it.                
I keep this baby under wraps.  If I lost it or it was stolen I would replace it with the exact item.                  
I can't get over how good this thing sounds, given how light it is.  Three-band EQ let's you fine-tune the sound locally - after you set it at the board.                
In/out on the front panel including RCA jacks for ambient sound between sets.  Line in/out on back for daisy-chaining.
Even has phantom power.                
Plug it in and go.  Very intuitive.  My only complaint is that its angle on the mic stand is fixed and sometimes I wish I could have more control over the direction of the sound.                
I've only had it for a few months, so it's hard to assess long-term durability, but it works very well and it's easy to carry.                
Lightweight, high power, plenty of control.  For $200 this thing is a real bargain.                
Haven't needed it, but the manual is very thorough.                
This is exactly what I was looking for.  I have a tight stage with no room for floor monitors and most musicians are uncomfortable without hearing themselves.  I bought 3 of these and they're perfect.  Drummers love them, too!                
I would replace it if it stopped working out of warranty.                
This monitor has saved my voice! Our band uses these as personal vocal monitors on a very small loud stage. We have found them to be especially useful by plugging our mics into one of the three channels on the front and running each output in the back to a seperate channel on the house sound board. Just make sure you dont turn the monitor's channel input up to high cause it will distort the house. 12 o'clock seems to be good for sm58's. We are able to hear our own vocals very good and can take them out of the stage monitors which avoids feedback.                
Not to impressed with the mic stand boomarm "extention". We found that putting the monitor on a seperate straight stand worked much better because we could adjust the monitor's height.                
Sounds great! I wish there was a four band EQ, or just make the frequencies smarter. Who needs 100hz knob with a 6.5" speaker? It needs a 1.25Khz knob. I'm still happy though!                
Behringer has really tightened up their QT. Thank God for that!!!!!!! This is a great monitor!                
Better than paying twice for that other brand!!!!!!!!                
I have other Behringer products. A "light bulb fuse" blew in one of my Behringer floor monitors. I called Behringer...they gave me a case number and had me call the company that makes the fuse...two days later I receive a package in the mail. Reasonable price, cause fuses aren't covered under warranty, fast shipping, great service!!!                
Fits great on a straight stand...not in the center of a boom like the say. It's small and light weight...doesn't take up much room on stage!                
Could use some pre-amp LEDs for input levels. Overall...saved my voice!                
I was looking for a compact, efficient musical instrument amplifier/speaker at a reasonable price, and discovered the Behringer.  Sound quality and feedback rejection are excellent.  Highly recommended.                  
No accessories needed.  Most useful are the separate instrument and mic level controls.                   
Two units can be connected together to expand coverage.  It also accomodates low impediance and high impediance mics automatically.                  
Quality construction.                 
When comparing features, this German-made unit is less expensive than US-made competitors.                
Excellent support from zZounds                
I am so satisfied with this device that I recommended it to another musician who also has purchased it.                
As this small monitor is only needed to provide our guitar sound to the three of us (sitting in a close semi-circle), we are not in needed of excellent tonal quality. Specifically, because the speaker is so small, it does not provide any deep bass. But the tone controls can be adjusted to at least make the sound this monitor produces to be pleasant and comfortable. 
We use this speaker as our only stage monitor when we run our sound through one or two Bose L1's system adjusted to relatively low house volume. It helps us hear our sound easily without having to increase the house sound.                
The quality of the connectors is excellent, and they provide the ability to easily interconnect this speaker with other speakers.                
Determining how to connect the mics and guitars, and control the volume and tone was straightforward. The control knobs are solid, easy to see and adjust.                
I am consistently impressed with the quality of material and construction of all the Behringer equipment I have owned.
I have owned various Behringer products, e.g guitar amps, powered and non-powered mixers, equalizers, feedback suppressors, cable tester, and all have been made with excellent construction. (However, some of the mixers seemed to have more noise than those of competing brands.) 
The item I am reviewing today (B205D) is their small powered speaker/monitor, and I am VERY happy with its performance!                
Behringer consistently provides more features on their equipment vs. all the competitor's similar priced items... and always at a lower price!                
Never needed to call/email support, but their User Manuals are well written and clearly explain all the controls and their functions.                
This monitor can be used on small stand, table, or just placed on the floor. Because of it's small size, when placed on the floor it does not seem to "get in the way" when located near your feet... nor is it visually obstructive to the audience!                
If mine was stolen, because of its size, quality and features... and low price, I would not hesitate to buy this exact same product again. In fact, if I were considering a wider stage, I would buy 2!                
I really like the clean and clear sound that I get from this unit.                
The multiple inputs and the pass through on this thing are great.                
This thing is very easy to use.                
When I got the unit, I was really happy with the quality of how it was made.                
For the money, it is a great buy.                
I fills that need for someone who wants some monitor but not earphones.                
I love this unit.                
I am a keyboard player for a cover band Old Rock, Blues, and Country
and this thing is the best for monitoring my keyboard good construction
mounts solid to a mic stand, if you play keyboard this is a great item to have.                
Have not used support yet                 
I bought the Eurolive B205D to use as a monitor for our band's drummer. It is perfect for our needs. So much so I am going to order another for our keyboard player. I think it is a good value and the foot print is no more than that of a microphone stand.                
I used to lead worship in a small church of 100 people and the pastor then (as well as the elderly) would complain about the noise coming off the stage from my guitar amp......well, this little box solved everything!!! (well not everything, I'm not there anymore, but it solved the noise issue) This was my vocal monitor and it was great for that! But I had already taken my amp home and was just running my pedals to the house (lame especially playing a hollow-body Gretsch) and the problem remained. I liked my monitor up really loud and even worship team members (the pastor's wife mostly) would complain about the volume (which this little gem has plenty of!!!)...then it hit me. I pulled the B205D off my mic stand and set it on the floor, plugged my pedal chain into the Line 1 input and ran a mic cord out of the thru to the house PA system. Eureka!!! It made the perfect "in-church" guitar amp. All I did then was turn the main volume down so as to bypass the B205D's speaker, got some in ear monitors, and we were rockin' and rollin'!!! I want one of these for my self now. It achieved great, tube amp quality, tone without the hassle of micing your amp and worrying about stage noise in a smaller venue!!!                
Honestly, this is the first time I will be using the PA speaker on my own. My previous experience has been with my foray in Karaoke by way of an ex who is also a Sound Engineer. We initially utilized Behringer products and I liked the size (as well as the sound) of the product and now that I am doing Karaoke on my own, it only made sense to go back to a tried and true product for me.                
wow, this little thing rocks! i am more than surprised how much output this thing has, and the sound is unbelievably natural, especially for vocals and guitar.   as stated before, the boom mic attachment is a  bit lacking, but that is the only downfall. just use it on a seperate stand and leave the wedges on the truck! why waste $$ on mackie, when this little guy does the exact same thing? i have it mounted to my drum rack, and will be ordering more for the rest of the band.                
My band has been using this these units for about a month. They add a lot of flexibility to our setup because we can actually use them for band rehearsals and not have to lug around the heavy equipment. Just daisy chain them together and you have all that you need. For gigs they save us a lot of stage space and allow us to personalize our monitor volumes. We also no longer experience feedback due to stage monitors. I accidentally dropped mine from about 5 feet onto a hard stage floor and there was no damage. I highly recommend these units.  I have not needed manufacturer support, so the rating for that has no meaning.                
Have several Mackies... so long as the Behringer holds- up, it is a great price! Don't expect to run all instruments thru it... just vocals, some guitar and maybe some keys.                
just what I need!                
seems fine... time will tell                
again, compared to the Mackie... half the price!!                
heven't needed it?                
I'm sold on the sound of this thing for the small intimate gig. I was not one to believe it until I saw a friend use one. I ran out and got one immediately and used it on a small bar gig. I put it in my back pack and took the train to the gig instead of driving in Manhattan with my larger speakers in tow. I really enjoyed it. Very powerful for the price.                
This baby rocks! No more floor wedges, no more 25-35 pound space hogging monitors. I am a drummer that needed a monitor to hear the vocals and guitars. I didn't need any bass as I am sitting next to the bass cabinet. This thing cuts through with plenty of volume to spare. I love that is is small as many of the venues that I play are very limited in drumming space. What is so amazing is that this thing delivers it all (except low end) in something that is the size of a shoe-box and weighs only 6 pounds. The guys in my band all are ready to ditch their heavy wedges and buy one.                
I tried to use this as an all-in-one bass amp and vocal monitor.  It works great for guitars, fiddle, vocals, but bass is just too farty.  In addition, it has lot of flabby sound if you don't plug in an xlr plug/cable to the input/outup xlr jack in the back, air escapes and makes a noise.  
It is too farty, as I said, for bass monitoring, unless you are at a low level.  It could be that I didn't have the ideal settings for using this with a bass, but I would just go with a smaller bass amp if you need monitoring.                
I use these in school as instant plug & play PA systems in halls and classrooms, AV monitors for presentations, choir foldback monitors, small ensemble foldback monitors and anywhere else I need usable volume and ease of operation. Don't expect extended bass or treble since you won't get it, but the sound is more than adequate for most purposes.
I prefer these over large monitors when playing as part of a duo since the sound is clean and controllable.                
You can plug in just about anything and get a reasonable sound. There is a stereo input option [summed to mono] as well as XLR and jack plug combo sockets, all with separate volume control, plus master level.
And an additional input and link output at the back. Oh, and a nice bright blue power on LED.                
You can plug in just about anything and get a reasonable sound. 
For non-techies they are ideal. Mounting on a mic stand is not brilliant due to the fixed angle of the 'top hat'.                 
The case is solid and nothing seems to rattle inside. The pots are the weak link as with most equipment at this price, but take care of the kit and it should keep working.                
It's a Mackie clone and does the same job for a lot less dosh. Mackie's build quality seems to have gone downhill of late [maybe I've been unlucky]. I've not had a Behringer failure yet, but I do try to have a back up, just in case.                
Pay more and you might get a better finish and possibly more reliability, but I like the feel and solidity of these monitors, and they look the business, so perceived value is quite high.                
Not perfect, but when viewed overall, the value is excellent and the sound quality good enough for most applications. I certainly expect to use them for a good many years and would happily purchase another one or two if necessary.                
Behringer did not miss a trick with this piece of gear. It suits my situation perfectly and has changed my opinion of Behringer products. Absolutely satisfied!                 
This is an AWESOME upgrade of the already fabulous B205D powered monitor. This unit is just MORE of an already great thing. The built in MP3 player makes it the end-all practice tool and the extra channel gives me everything I need for live monitoring situations. Just an AWESOME piece. I love it.                
Loud for such a small speaker. Nice bottom end though it won't handle today's dance music, disco music for a wedding reception sounded great.                
Could use a handle of some kind.                
We'll see how it holds up.                
It worked for what I needed it for at a very fair price, much less than other manus.                
Really don't know. I've owned several Behringer products over the years and never had to call for support.                
I bought 2 of these 6 months ago.  I've performed with them with a quartet and trio in bars, coffeehouses, and outdoor gigs.  The sound is so good that it turns heads!  My 88-key piano sounds better through these than any of the big iron I've ever run it through.  And guitar and vocals are just crisp and musical.  As floor monitors down in front or mains on stands these are superior speakers.                
The built-in 70db preamp with bass/treble is a great feature, sorely missed in many far more expensive powered speakers.                
No learning curve at all - no need to look at the manual.                
Very well constructed and finished.  Totally dependable.  These speakers live permanently in the back seat of my car, next to my 88-key piano.                  
Haven't needed any support.                
The simplicity, completeness of features, and sheer fine sound makes these speakers a must.  Buy them because they sound a LOT better than any of the large 12/horn 15/horn speakers I own from major companies.  These
speakers weigh 15 pounds each - painless to put up on speaker stands.                
Now that I have these little wonders, I'm moving along about half of my other much bigger passive speakers, because they just don't compete for convenience or for sheer sound quality.  I expect to use these for years to come.  If they were lost or stolen I'd *immediately* buy 2 more.                
I am not a DJ. I just bought this to replace my blown out Bluetooth speaker in the backyard. And what a wise choice. The speaker sounds amazing! Sounds like I have a live band playing in the backyard. And I only have one. The only thing I can suggest is if you are using this for personal home use. Make sure you get the cable that converts the stereo signal from device to a mono signal to the speaker. If you dont, the sound will not sound correct.                
I received these 5 days ago and I must say, they pack quite a punch and clarity for such a small speaker. I hooked them to the 100 hz hi pass filter of my B1200D subwoofer and the sound is impeccable. For small size (100 or less) audiences, the are perfect.                
I ordered a blemished unit and saved a lot. It arrived looking like new. I have only had a chance to use it twice but it does the job. I will not know how long it will last but it is built well and I have other Behringer equipment that I have used for years and they are still going strong. I use this for guitar/singing as a solo gospel singer. My pastor had a smaller competitors unit that was nice but this has much more power and is a bigger speaker. 
I got a good deal on this because it was a return. When it arrived it looked like brand new. I have a solo guitar/singer gospel act and this is great for the Church/Auditorium type venue. My Pastor usually lets me use his 30W Roland Cube and it is nice. This just needs a small mixer and has much more power and better sound. Haven't needed support so I gave them a 3. I own other Behringer products and haven't needed support for them.                 
Perfect for outdoor wedding ceremony music / slide show presentations / mixing @ home!                
The sound from the B210D is pretty clean with a slight hint of grain in the highs. It produces very little bass, but it sounds decent with acoustic recordings. You get much better results when using them with a subwoofer,leaving most of the bass to be handled by the sub. They are better suited for midrange and highs. I bought them to use as monitors for my Mobile DJ system, so i did not expect too much from them.  Sound is decent for the low price. Would recommend using a BBE Sonic Maximizer or if possible DBX Driverack PX.                 
Easy to use.                 
The quality is very good for the price. Like how lightweight they are.                 
Pretty good value for the money.                 
It has a nice design.                 
I bought these to use as monitors at my DJ gigs. Did not want to spend too much for personal monitors, these fit the bill pretty good for now. Can be used in a small system with Subwoofers crossed over at 100hz or higher to get the most out of them. Using a BBE 882i Sonic Maximizer really opens them up a bit. Got them with the Play As You Pay option from Zzounds,which is awesome. This is my 4th purchase from them. Zzounds delivers every time.                 
The sound of the speaker is clean and crisp! It produces an unbelievable for such a small speaker. I've recently used two of these speakers to cover four ballrooms at the Ramada Inn located in Philadelphia, Pa. I didnt even have the volume up a quater of the way and the sound was excellent throughout the whole room. Although the woofers are only 10inches, those bad boys were able to push out an enormous amount of bass. I wanted to purchase a pair of JBL's but my budget would not allow such.  I am not a firm believer that Behringer is committed to providing quality products that can compete with the competition.                
The most useful feature are its easy to carry handles located on the side of the product.  The speakers are abou 23lbs. The handles enbale you to carry them around without straining your back.                
I was planning on buying a pair of JBL's after my event was completed and trading in these speakers for cash but I'm so impressed with this product that I wish to keep it within my possession.                
Economical & light weight with reasonable sound quality & power. I recommend for use as a floor monitor or small pole mounted PA system, or for fill speakers in larger venue. Very wide dispersion so may overlap with other monitors. The tuned resonant enclosure is too boomy for my taste, so I lightly pack foam or cloth in the two vents on either side of the horn. Then use an equalizer to smoothly roll up the low end. For clubbing or "driving" type music the boomyness is probably OK. The B210D is not as clear as it's bigger brothers the B212D and B215D. Surprisingly the 15 inch bi-amped B215D is the clearest of the family. But much heavier and twice the price.                
I bought two of these speakers to use in a location that books weddings and small conferences. They sound great and can get very loud which is good because they use them outdoor as well. Compatible with just about any application.                 
These speakers are a great value for the price.                 
I was looking for a small monitor that would give me good sound for acoustic music and double for a vocal monitor for a 4pc. classic rock band. I took a chance on the B210D because I have a older pair of passive B212 Behringer speakers that for years rocked hard and still sound good. Im very happy with my choice. All the reviews I read were correct. Great sound bolth highs and lows. Lightweight, dosent take up much room,( at fifty those are important things!!!!) With a sub or for small Gig could be used for front end sound, it has that much power and Quality sound.                
I use these powered speakers in a stero pair.  They sound very good lots of power without being muddy.  Let me clear, these are not the best sounding studio referance monitors, and they are not priced that way.  For live sound use or as a DJ they deliver room filling good clean audio.                
These speakers have 2ch. Parametric EQ, Level, XLR & 1/4 inputs with an XLR link output.  That is all the controle you could want in powerd PA's.                
Plug it in, turn it on, turn it up...What else is there?                
The build quality seems very good.  With the built in handels they are easy to move and setup.                  
For the price I know of nothing that even comes close.  You could spend 2X the price and get speakers that may sound better, but only in controled acoustic settings, not in the real world.                
I called the company once to ask a question, got a quick accurate answer in English...That was all I could ask for.                
You simply can't go wrong for the price.  These do exactly what you want and do it for a great price.  They just sound good and are very easy to work with.  Buy them, you won't regret it.                
I use these speakers for my mids/highs and run it thru a Behringer Crossover and the sound is AWESOME!!! What makes it better is I have 482 BBE Sonic Maximizer!! I played them by them selves and they have some punch to them, but you can tell you will need subs for bigger venues. I also use them as just PA speakers in a band for 250 to 300 ppl and the sound is awesome too. These speakers are a no brainer. Price, Quality and Sound are awesome for there size.                
Power cords are short, but you can buy more that are longer, no big. Bass and treble adjustments are really acurate. The line out/ pass thru is handy too for expanding the system. Also its 550 watts at peak, 280 watts rms @ 8 ohms to woofer (450 watts peak) and 65 watts rms @ 8 ohms (100 watts peak). This is well enough for any gigs for medium to small venue.                
Bass and Treble adjustment to tweak your sound, awesome!!                
They have a little weight to them, but light enough to carry both with one person. the construction is really good...its not cheap at all. For the speakers in this price range                 
Very high value!                
needed none yet                
Very nice look to them and most portable speakers i've come across in a long while.                
I've had a pair of these little puppies for a little over two years. I didn't buy them here (although I should have) but did buy a Behringer B1800D Pro Subwoofer from zZounds to go with them. I am a mobile DJ and these babies have done quite a few shows both indoor and outdoor and I am always getting compliments on how well my system sounds, even from other DJs who have a ton more money invested in their speaker systems. I use these and 1 B1800D powered sub for my small setup and I am more than satisfied with their performance. They have sound quality that you would only expect from a much more expensive speaker. They have plenty of projection in the mids and hi's and decent bass in a small indoor environment but for larger venues or outdoors you definitely need a sub to get enough bass.                
The speaker it self is durable, a little heavy but durable. I own 2 and saving for 2 more of the 15's. They sound clearer than the Mackie Thumps and almost come close to any Peavy I have heard. Even with the bass turn all the way down I still get a good low end. I get compliments, referrals, and business after every venue from these 2 alone. I also have 2 Harbinger 12's that don't even come close to the quality of these bad boys. Simply put, I really enjoy my decision and look forward to get my of Behringer products in the future.                 
I am very happy with my purchase of the Behringer powered speaker...not just because of the brand but because of the ease of the transaction. The site is chock full of every kind of musical-related product and in addition to that, ZZounds has a friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff to assist. I am very impressed with ZZounds and will continue to utilize the site for all of my musical needs!                
Great sound, great service. Using this for my home karaoke set up. Can't wait to add another one. Sound is awesome!!!                
Bought these to use for vocal monitors. Clean and powerful. Don't try to over saturate them with low end. They're only 12"s. I can't comment on manufacturer support. I haven't needed any from Behringer yet and own many of their products.                
This was very easy to setup and use. I did it quick and was up and going at my gig in no time.                
It seem lick it is built to last a long time. Now I'm very careful with my thing anyway but still it look like it will last me a long time.                
For the price and what you get WOW just cannot beat it anywhere. I always shop around and this is worth every dime.                
I've not had to call for help yet.                
It looks like it cost a lot of money.                
So far I am please with these speaker and will be using them a long as I do my thang as a DJ.                
Good sound. There is a LOT of bass for such a small package. I play keyboards through mine and have to EQ out some of the bass.                
Like the EQ on the back, the balanced input and the link capability.                
Plug and play. And the knobs on the back are protected by the design of the cabinet.                
I used one for a little over a year, then it sounded distorted at even really low volume. Good price for a good sound, but when they break you might as well throw them away. I wished I had spent a little more and bought JBL or EV. I recently sold a Fender amp made in 1968. It had the original tubes and still sounds good. There is no way anything made by Behringer is going to last that long.                
Best bang for buck 2 way Powered speaker system.  Light and Loud.  A little noisy when there is no program music, but otherwise good.                
I like the in/out options as well as the low, mid and hi adjustments.                
Plug and Play is all you need.                
For this price range, it is the best value.                
Best bang for buck.                
I have not had to deal with them, so they get a hi rating from me here.                
It's good.                
I would get this again.                
This speaker will get earbleeding loud, but it has no low bass and the tweeter clips easily.  I've replaced it with JBL EON515 and I'm a lot happier now!                
Quality is great! I brought this product for pool side and it really delivers!!!!!                
Volume control on each speaker is a very good feature                
This does not get any better!!!!!! Ipod with a play list and speakers =  goodtime....sorry mr dj                
The Behringer B212D was surprisingly light and I questioned the actual power rating as a powered speaker. It was affordable and has good clarity but overall I am slightly disappointed as it unlike a real power amp cannot be turned up all the way as it produces very harsh feedback at all frequencies. When matched with a behringer feedback destroyer only produces feedback free performances at half volume.                
Nice punchy sound from this small light package.  Excellent for outdoor venues.  Very easy to use.  This is a great buy.                
One of the reviewers was disappointed with the bass response from these cabinets. Perhaps if you're a DJ and use them for bass heavy dance music they might not be the best, I don't know. I use them for vocals and an instrument or two. We have a trio, guitar, bass, drums and are occasionally accompanied by a keyboardist. They sound great for vocals. Sometimes we'll mic my guitar amp and run the keyboards through them as well.
EQ your sound correctly and they do a great job.                
The slightly rounded front of the cab leaves the metal grill prone to damage so I try and be careful when packing up and loading them in the truck in order to keep them looking nice. The handle design is good                
Plug and play, no biggie here.
What does add to the ease of use is the light weight of 24 lbs. I had some great sounding Peavey SP-5 cabinets but at 66 lbs. each it was more than a hassle to load in and set up. At the odd venue where you need to go up a flight of stairs instead of struggling to get a cab up there I can grab two of these at once with ease                
Beside staying aware of the metal grill and packing to prevent damage and dents to it, the cabinets are well constructed.                
I am very pleased with these. I purchased an inexpensive product and didn't expect much. I intended on keeping my large cabinets and only use these for venues that made a big heavy cabinet impractical. The rest of the time I intended on using them as floor monitors. After using these and hearing how good they sounded for our needs I was glad to sell my old cabinets and use Behringers exclusively for mains. We have been setting up with one of these positioned slightly the band to double as a monitor. We have had no problems with feedback. If we begin playing larger venues and need to add additional floor monitors I will add more of these cabinets.                
I have had no problems with them so no need to ask for support                
A nice looking product                
If lost or stolen I would replace them. I feel they were a very good value for the price. I think they will last a long time given proper handling and usage                
The sound quality is awesome. I cant say no more. It's clear and marvelous. Although I haven't tested it on any other setting than my own apt. but the sound quality is brilliant. I tested these Behringer Eurolive B212XL Speakers on New Year's Eve, and the party lasted hrs continous. They really rock. Eventhough one has to adjust the the input signal, meaning the EQ on your mixer, but besides that they are brilliant. 
One of my biggest concerns, I think, is the subwoofer. With no doubt, the sound on these speakers is great. But, I think Behringer have to keep improvining the quality of the bass. I think there is not that much response to the low frequencies. In other words, there is not that much of a deep bass output. I had to adjust my EQ on my mixer, Behringer DJX 700, increasing the the "low" and reducing the "high and mid" until I could find the the right balanced. So, I believe the sound quality is right, but my concern is the bass.  
This is brilliant. It's not complicate to install. I would say the setup is easy.                
This product is definetly made well. I have no problems with it for now. So, I believe these speakers were made to last for ever.                
Yes, yes, yes, my speakers deliver great sound. And what's better than to have equipments that deliver great sound quality at totally affordable prices. Thats what I like about Behringer products. This company makes real good quality products with a lot of features on it at totally low prices. Honestly, Behringer is the best. No doubt about it.                
Yes at all. Behringer is great, especially for the people who don't have a big budget, but are looking for a good product with lots of features on it.                
The desing is perfect. This product has an authentic look, and is adjustable to particularly any setting.                
Well, I expect to use this product until it last, no doubts. In case of technical and physical problems I would say that's a whole another issue.                
Rich, fat, clean and wonderfully affordable.  These 28 pound beauties outperform the 70+ pound EV Eliminators they were purchased to replace.                
It would have been nice if they came with covers or if covers were at least available for them.                
Easy to load, easy to set up.                
They seem very well made.                
Very affordable.                
I'll be sorely disappointed if I ever have to replace these.                
These 12's have a really good kick to them, especially for the size, and weight(at 26 lbs. makes for an easy breakdown at the nights end). You can use them as stage monitors, or throw a stand under them and use conventionally.                
The 1/4" connectors, and speakons are true professional.                
Super easy to hook up, and not much to learn.                
Behringer...German quality. Great size and shape for mobile gigs for both DJ's, and bands.                
Great value for $150 each you can't go wrong. 800 WATTS                
Great enclosure for the money. The cabs are not as deep as I thought they would be- size wise. The sound great for 12's.  The titanium compression driven horn has a good sparkle without being too harsh.                
The enclosure has a solid, quality feel to it. The grille is slightly flimsy, but should protect the woofer for most light duty mishaps...                
Pop it on a stand, plug in a speakon cable and you're ready to go. Havinf parallel 1/4" jacks AND parallel speakon jacks is a real plus. It can also be used as a floor monitor.                
Very good build quality for China. Plastic is not the most durable material for a speaker cabinet, but, for light duty sound work, it should work out just fine.                
Awesome speaker for the money.                
Behringer has always been great to work with for me...                
It suits my purpose very well.                
It should last me for a while...                
I use these pair for vocals.I was very surprise how good they sound like.very crisp, just like what i'm looking for on a vocal speaker.                
The very usefull feature that i like other than good sound quality are the built in carrying handle on both side of the speaker.                
I take good care all my equipment. This pair looks like its well build to last.Don't have any problem so far.                
best product you can buy for the amount of money you pay. 
I have any warranty issues so far, so cannot comment on it.                
I chose these pair because it works good for my applications and I would buy it again.                 
what a speaker, clear voice, moderate low, and most of all vary crisp highs... easy to push these speakers with 200 rms, and they are vary loud for such a 12 inch 2 way speaker...  the design is good, the quality is good as well....   these speakers are much louder than my older 12 inch speakers...   the bass is ok, but these speakers are more for vocals, music and crisp highs...                  
I just bought the BR212 Euro Live spaekers for DJ purpose the highs are great but no bass response at all. The product is ok if you need some crisp highs but other than that could have been better designed for more active sound. I am switching over to Peavey PR15N's I have heard them many of times and they sound great. No comparrison between the two. The experience with zzounds has been great. They are very helpful
and recommend them for your purchasing.                  
The Free Speaker Stands make it a Good Buy.                
Like i said before great sound for highs. cannot seem to adjust very much or they sound distorted and the horn starts cracking. Very easy to setup and use.                
Seems to be built very well as far as durability,but as for the componets it's hard to say how long they would hold up.                 
Great buy for a novice who wants to play and get some experience.                
I have only dealt with zzounds and they are great fast response as far as Behringer i have no idea did not keep the speakers long enough to deal with Behringer.                
Definetly a Sexy looking Speaker                
Satisified for one day and made the determination to exchange                
The Speaker is excellent.                
Good sound nice rugged build worth the buy                 
Sounds great, works great                
I bought 4 of these as stage monitors but was not happy at all with the sound. After replacing all 4 of the 200-watt, 2-inch voice coil woofers with 350-watt, 3-inch voice coil woofers these things are as good as most of them out there. They now have way more bass and are much louder too. Happy to say that after spending another $260.00 on parts, these are 5-star speakers. The original woofers are very poorly made and have no protective circuitry, so be careful with them! The compression drivers and cross-overs are a good match for far better LF drivers, so Behringer dropped the ball on these. The HF drivers are protected, so go ahead and beef them up with better woofers!                 
For the price, the sound quality is good.   I don't think there's too much else in this price range, except the Peavy PV series, that can do any better.   The highs and clarity could be improved, but I would expect that in a higher-end speaker.                
Basic 2-way speaker, but the dual speak-on and 1/4" combination jacks are very handy.                   
There's nothing to it, like any passive speaker.  Plug and go.                
So far, after a couple of months, so good.                
Great for the price.                
Really, I have no opinionm since I haven't dealt with the company as of yet.                
It looks good and compares favorably to its competition.                
I will probably use this product until it wears out, or something with better sound quality for similar money comes along (which I don't expect anytime soon).                
I got a pair of these to practice with my metal band and to use as a PA for when im playing EDM around the city. I just have to say..WOW. These things are awesome. just one by itself is louder than my line 6 half stack, which is one of the louder guitar amps you can find. The sound quality is excellent, You could run a whole band through it, and I do. Although, you may want a pair for that. When used as a pair, these things start to drown out the rest of the band when playing in our practice room. Man i dont have to worry about getting our volume on par with the drums. When im playing club music around the town I dont have to worry about what kind of sound the venue has, this thing will do a great job. And if by chance its a really big venue who insist on running thier own sound, I just use these as stage monitors, or just stick one behind the drummer so he can hear everything. The only thing i would say is watch for clipping, some of the newer models have an indicator light on the front so you can make sure you know when clipping happens. For some smaller events, i just turn these things backwards.. this allows me to play very loud without feedback and gives me a view of the clip indicator light on the back side of the speaker. that being said, you have a high volume ceiling for clipping and feedback so it is only an issue if you are extremely loud.. which these are. Each of these things put out 126db at one meter. So when i say these are loud i mean it. Also, the bass hits hard, 99% of the time this is all you will need.. but if you want earth shattering bass, you will want to check out the B1800d subs to go along with these..
I promise you, get these things, the value is undeniable, and i dont think there is a better deal on the market. These by themselves are a full sound setup.                
I'm very impressed with the sound!  It's very clear, and plenty loud, even with the dials at 12 o'clock.  I love powered speakers because of the built in amps.  We use JBL powered speakers that are very comparable in size and these sound just as good, and they are a bit lighter, and a couple hundred dollars cheaper.  I love how they are designed to be both main PA speakers, and floor monitors.  They are not meant to withstand a lot of bass, even tho they do handle it well - main pa speakers are really meant for mid to high range.  These paired up with a couple of subs would sound great for any application.                
The features are awesome.  I like simple, and this really is a plug in and play type speaker.  High and low EQ and volume built right in, but you shouldn't really have to make any turns on the EQ knobs because they sound great set at '0.'  I like all the built in components as well; the limiters protect the speaker, the crossover, etc.  The molded plastic case is well built and I see it lasting a while with proper handling.                
Ease of use?  Very.  Plug it in, turn it on, adjust the volume and eq, and that's it.  No external eq or power amps required.                
The quality of how it's made?  It's as pretty as a powered speaker can be.  The power button and eq knobs seem to be well built as well as the input and output jacks.  The metal speaker grill is just like any other powered speaker grill.  The pole mount under the speaker is very handy, and the 45 degree angles allow the speaker to be arrange in a variety of ways.                
The value is the main reason I buy Behringer.  Power to weight ratio is awesome, well built, sounds great, durable, and low cost compared to other brands that are just as good.                
Never had to have a product serviced or replaced by Behringer, despite some of the other reviews, but I have called them with tech questions, and everytime I've called I've had a pleasant experience with very knowledgable staff.  I will be looking forward to finding some matching Behringer powered subs!                
Sex appeal?  You wouldn't catch me humping it, but it looks like a powered speaker should look - modern.                
I would replace this speaker if I had to because of all the features and value I've listed above.                
Great speaker, and very affordable. If this is your price range, these are the best you can find. After alot of research, it was between these and the Mackie Thumps. After a side by side sound test, it was an easy choice                
Simple 3 knob eq. Plug and play                
I gave it a 10 because it is well made for the price range.                
I recently sold my big rack of gear because, i got sick of hauling it around with me to gigs, and also got rid of my 76 pound JBL's.. I had a friend who had told me to check out these Behringers,  and he told me about all the benefits of having powered speakers, so i decided to buy one to check it out..I am extremely impressed with the sound of these powered speakers, and also love how light that they are compared to my old speakers..These sound fantastic,  and they have a lot of power..I just ordered a second speaker to use as my mains for my Karaoke/Dj show and also for gigs with my band..These sound a lot better than my old JBL's,  very clear highs, and plenty of bass..I went to a Local music store and compared these with the JBL Eon's , Mackie Thump, and an Alto powered cabinet, These sounded better and were cheaper.. So I called and ordered these from Zzounds,  and I am an extremely happy guy..Lightweight, Great sounding, powerful, and very reasonably priced..I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for a Quality Powered Speaker!                 
The response to my DJ system is AMAZING! Everytime I DJ I feel like im in a nightclub having a blast, never had speakers like this definitely the best ones thus far!!! This speaker is perfect as is !                 
Everything is nice and tight, smooth edges, pretty heavy due to the awesome parts within the speaker to produce the awesome sound! But all around its EXCELLENT!                
This product is definitely worth its price, the performance that the speakers give out is amazing!                
N/A                
The appeal matches my DJ equipment to the T, its gives everyone the look as if it were to be "FIERCE" and it questions you saying "Are you ready to party?".. Thats the kind of appeal this speaker give you! The best!!!                
The best speakers I've ever invested in! Never will be replaced! Excellent sound and quality all around! if the ratings can reach to 20, I eouldnt hesitate to rate it that high, and also zzsounds for their awesome payment plan if it wasnt for that, I wouldn't have these speakers.
Thanks zzsounds! 
AJ                
This Speakers are Awesome!! Great sound, Highs And Mids are excellent. I wish the Lows had just a little more Thump!! But its perfect for the events the do.                
Built in Amp!!                
Light weight for us guys to carry around!! Black plastic cabinet & finish that will last a long time!!                
Well worth it!!                
For a powered speaker under $300 (actual price was $279.99)the sound is clear with good amount of detail and bass. With 126db output they get pretty loud. I paired them off with the B1800D subs using a DBX DriveRack PX and they sounded great. Very impressed with the sound from these Behringers. I was not expecting much from them.                 
Good and simple features. Has 1/4in TRS and XLR input along with XLR output which is good for linking more speakers together.  Also has volume, bass and treble controls wchich make it ideal for use as single PA.                 
Very easy to use and setup. Just plug them in and you're ready to go.                 
The quality is as good as any other.                 
The value of the B215D is incredible when you consider the price, power, weight and sound. $279.99 is a steal.                 
Have not needed to call support.                 
The look is clean and simple.                 
The Behringer B215D gives you alot bang for buck. I own JBL PRX and SRX speakers and was looking for a budget speaker to kick around for the occassional low end gig. I as blown away by the sound and value the Behringer B215D offered. Was not expecting the level of sound and quality the B215D produced. I have used Behringer in the past in a small club that has 4 B215D and 2 B1800D as their system. They rock good and hard every weekend. They give JBL,EV,QSC and Mackie a Real Good run for their money at a 1/4 to a 1/3 the price. You can buy 2 B215D along with 2 B1800D subs for $1799.95 from ZZounds and thats including $41.99 shipping for the subs. With their Play as You Pay program you can't go wrong. I ordered mine on Friday afternoon 8/5/11 and got them Tuesday 8/9/11. I highly recommend these for any DJ beginner or pro on a budget looking for good sounding set of speakers.                  
I use this for Zumba and R.I.P.P.E.D. both have loud and fun music.  This speaker sounds amazing!                  
I love it, because it is pretty much plug and play.  I don't need a bunch of fancy features, just a speaker that booms!                
This is sooo easy to use.  Just plug (in my case an Ipod) and play!                
I think this product is super well made.  It has been hauled back and forth to my classes for a couple of months now and is holding up amazingly well.                
I think the price is really good for what you get.  I purchases another speaker before this one, it was only $70 cheaper, and it was terrible!  This speaker is a super value!                
I accidentally bought the wrong cord to connect my ipod to the speaker, I called Behringer support spoke to a human immediately, and he told me what was causing my problem.  Excellent customer service from Behringer!                
It looks like a beast, and sounds like a beast.  Everyone commented on it, saying how it sounded great and looks pretty cool!                
I use this speaker for my group fitness classes in a large dance studio.  It sounds awesome!  The bass is good, and it fills the room.  It is also very easy to transport to and from class.                  
Great loud.  Great quiet.  You can use these as keyboard monitors, digital drum amps, etc.  I plugged a mic direct in.  Too dry for me.  I use a little reverb so recommend a mixer with effects as an input.                  
EQ.  The feat on the bottom allow you to stack these on top of each other.  The tops have a receiver for the feet.  Also you could hang these with threaded rod.  The inputs and daisy chain outputs are easy to use.                
Easy learning curve.  Much easier than full pa set up with crossovers etc.  I actually ran 4 of these.  2 on each side stereo right and left.  2 stacked on each other.  I eq'd the bottom more bass.  Top more high.  Sounded fantastic.  I ran mp3 stereo summed mono into 1 speaker.  Sounded fantastic.   Again, eq to taste.  I tested these in many ways.  Easy. Fun.  Happiness factor high.                
Based on the fact that the guy i bought these from had his B215A s for many years under constant use in bands and they still work great I would say reliability is high.  All things manufactured fail.  A certain number of brand new components are lemons.  Doesn't mean all Behringer products suck.  I have been using other Behringer products for years.  Read and follow good engineering practices and likely your stuff will last well.                  
I would say the price of these is a bargain.  I love Behringer amps.  I have several inucs iI use with my non powered peavey and samson speakers.  Their amps are really quiet and run cool.  Their technology is great.                
No experience                 
Looks nice.  My appeal to Behringer is their drive to help everyday people better understand acoustics and how to get better sound.  I have learned alot reading their on line download manuals on their website.  They go into more detail then you get in quick guides shipped in your stuff.                
I bought 2 of these used.  Well used as well as B215As (earlier 400 watt amp versions of these). I bought them because what I paid for the 4 of them I couldn't pass up.  I have been working with sound and PA s for years, anything and everything to fully miked bands.  I hadn't had experience with powered speakers.  These sound great.  I haven't had them long but have cranking them at work all night playing my phone as preamp through them with mp3 classic rock music.  Really loud and very clean.  EQ is handy depending on environment.   I also plugged in my digital recorder (zoom) as a mixing board and this was a great preamp as well.  Today I plugged my Les Paul through my Boss ME25 guitar board direct into one of these laying on the floor as a monitor.  It was great.   Again eq was handy.                
First of all im a sound perfectionist an i had high hopes for these speaker and well... i was right! These speakers sound great! Powering on these badboys you get a slight signal hiss but that disappears soon as you play music. These being LOUD speakers i already expected there not to have much low end bass BUT the bass is definately there and something you can feel across the room but if your looking for hiphop/dubstep bass you definately need subwoofers. The highs and mids are clear and full sounding and LOUD i honestly havent turned the volume past HALF and its almost TOO loud! So you have headroom with these! As for build quality they feel solid and a little on a heavy side but if you want good speakers deal with it. The plastic material shell does scratch fairly easy but other than that im thoroughly impressed. Everyone that hears these speakers has that "wow" face on haha ill be buying a pair of the powered 18s and another pair of these badboys pretty soon. They cheap enough to replace if they do break down on you but these a reliable so far! Enjoy!                
They sound really nice. I updated from a pair of yamaha 115 club series passive speakers. These sound as good in my opinion. 
I do use a active sub with these. I play hip hop r&b and soulful house so they get a variety played thru them. To summarize I am satisfied.                 
Well for starters, I think just like ANY product on the market (even more with budget items such as these) you have a bit of a hit and miss track record and that needs to be understood by anyone looking to buy these or ANY other powered PA speaker.  I used a set of JBL Eon 1500's for years, all the while being disappointed with the low end, always needing to bring along subs to get good sound, and also experiencing HF driver failure on both of my cabs @ separate times (And having JBL refuse to replace them under warranty!) Now working & DJ'ing at a small bar/club we bought a pair of the Behringer 215D's and I have been nothing but impressed! they have more low end then my EON's and get almost as loud on the high end! They really get abused here too,out of town DJ's and bands, getting thrown in and out of storage and 3-4 times a week to get used and abused.. We use them for DJ's, karaoke,open mics,etc.. You do need to really watch the clipping, without a clean signal they do clip fairly easily if you try to push them too hard. And we've had a few DJ's that just don't understand that, and have forced them into overload protection, but they reset quickly and keep ticking! I am so impressed with them that if I had to do it over again I would buy 4 of these for the price rather than 2 JBL EONS's and have WAY more sound for less money! Just as with any powered or passive cab of this size you will need a sub if your really trying to get that "club sound" but from my point of view, and experience over the last few years with these they ROCK for this price they are well worth every penny!                 
Inputs, outputs and High, low and master volume control.  You don't need anything else really. If you want more then your gonna pay for it!                 
Easy to set up, just take a little time really listing to them at the volume you are going to want them to be used at and tune them from there. Don't try to get concert sound volume out of them and you won't be disappointed!                 
Using these speakers is so simple, as it should be, the controls are easy to get to, feel fairly solid and as I have already stated we abuse these more than I think most of you would, getting pulled in and out of storage several times a week, used by DJ's, Karaoke singers, and as monitors for bands. And they have taken it all. Maybe we just bought the best pair Behringer ever made. But I'm willing to bet the rest are pretty close in Quality to the ones we picked up ;)                  
Personally with my experience with the ones I have used for the past two years I would recommend them 100% to any one looking for a nice, very portable, powered cab! (At just about any price)                
Gave them a 6 just because I haven't had to use the support.                
Its a pretty sexy item, fairly run of the mill look, but I like it, as do most. And it looks good on a stand in any room, not too big, not too bulky and just sexy enough haha! ;)                 
These would only be replaced for a permanent house set up,with much larger cabs and external amps. but for portability to my mobile gigs they are just awesome! Maybe if I found a CRAZY deal that was too good to pass up on the new EON powered 15's then I would replace these but at this price they sound great and are way too good of a deal to get anything else!                  
It sounds excellent, great sound quality, responds perfectly to my playing, especially to my material from my digital recorder when I play to it live, the sound is very expressive, helps me achieve THE sound I'm looking for, perfect for my style, all the sounds are great straight across the board. Sounds great with just my playing (vocals and accoustic guitar) and singing, and also with the recorded stuff, lots of bass guitar and drums. At high volumes it sounds clear and the fidelity is wonderful.                
The only accessories were the power cables. The features are simple and very easy to understand and use. That's just how I like it. There are no least useful features. I can't think of anything I would add to it.                
To get a great sound out of this thing all you have to do is plug it in and turn it on (as long as what you put into it sounds good in the first place) It has a really good variety of inputs, super options here. There's hardly anything to learn about it, except, with good quality input material, you'll get the same back out of it.                
It is made very well, extremely road-worthy, and will hold up. Great tough finish, perfect size, and absolutely a great weight, super light for 15' and a horn, and for it's size it is extremely powerful, I've never had it over half-way on the volume and it kicks butt.                
For the money, this is absolutely the best you can get. Great value.                
Don't know, and don't think I'm gonna have to find out, 'cos this thing is built very, very well. But I've dealt with Behringer before and they hook me up. No complaints.                
It has no sex appeal. But it does provide the best sound quality for the money. It is a practical addition to my set-up.                
I'll be satisfied with this item until someone comes out with something better for a lower price. I chose this one 'cos of the price and what it will do for the price. I does help my goals in putting out the RIGHT sound. If lost or stolen, I would replace it with the same thing. Like most: it kicks major butt, like least: it's still heavier than what I wish it were. Nothing that I wish I knew before I bought it.                
Ever get that feeling when you walk out of a store like "I just got over on these guys big time!"?  
I purchased these speakers in store at GC.  At the time, I was prepared to shell out $1200 for a pair of Mackies or QSCs.  I gave them both a listen, and they sounded great.  Then the salesperson said to give the Behringers a listen.  OMG!  I couldn't tell any difference in sound, and the projection was so much clearer.  At the same volume I could stand across the room at different angles and hear the Behringers so much better.  When he showed me the price tag my jaw nearly hit the floor.
I use these speakers for my band.  We mostly play full out rock shows, but we also play acoustic shows.  I'm constantly impressed with how these speakers handle when pushed - no clipping or breakup.  They sound amazing in our acoustic shows.  No humming or hissing.  Just couldn't be happier.
Bottom line folks - don't be fooled by a name.  I've heard some negative comments about Behringer, but everyone who comes to our shows loves how my PA sounds.  Give these speakers a listen for yourself and let your ears be the judge.                
Loud!Loud!Loud! Strong sound. Little light on the lows but overall good sound for the price. Highly recommend.                
I got a pair and what awesome sound!!                 
I was impressed with the sound, the thumb and the power of the speaker in general, great price for more speaker                
these speakers and very good speakers for the d j who wants quality sound and want to give any type of venue good sounding music. They sound good inside as well as outside . you must watch your control and peak signal not to over power them if using a board .                 
Love the product.  I've been in the Behringer family for a while now with some of their passive speakers.  I like this powered speaker because of the convience.  Instead of lugging my heavy keyboard amp to rehearsal..I just grab this with one hand and go.  It's sound quality is excellent and it even handles some bottom(bass).  All in all it was a great investment for me at a very affordable price.  I'm getting another one later on!!                
Love the sound of my pa system                
I bought these as the main speakers for my PA. I was impressed with their volume, though the lows were not as low as you would expect with 15s, but nothing a sub wouldn't pick up. However, after a couple of months, one just cut out and will not work any longer. I cannot even turn it on without input and it clips and shuts down. The real issue.... Try getting warranty service on these things. I have tried thru their website. Multiple calls (both times I got fed up after being on hold for an hour and just leave a message), using the care@music-group email address. I cannot even get anything other than an automated response. Normally I get warranty issues resolved in less time than I have been sitting and just trying to get a response. BEWARE....                
WWWWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOWWWWWWWWW  WHAT GREAT SOUND IN REALITY I COULDNT BELIEVE IT JUST ONE THING JUST TI B SINCIRE THEY R NOT 550 RMS BUT PEAK  BUT NEVER THE LESS THET SOUND UNBELIVABLE                
THEY R MOST USFULL FOR FLOOR OR SMALL  ROOM                 
GREAT AND SIMPLE                
THE FEEL LIKE A MILLION BUCKS                
CANT BE BEATING                
ZZOUND GREAT                
COULD B BETTER                 
I WOULD WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS                
I would definately not advise anyone to buy these speakers. I purchased 2 and within months had to send one in for repairs. The other one also gave out a few months later. I sent it in for repairs and a week later it gave out again and so i need to send it in again. Of course the shipping to the repair shop is at my cost. Behringer will not replace them which is what I feel they should do as they were practically new. They seemed to overload and shut down for no apparent reason while just turned on and not in use. I bought B212's at the same time for monitors and they have been fine so far. I suspect Behringer was a better Company when their product was actually manufactured in Germany.                
I demoed this Powered speaker and it really sounds as good as any powered speaker that would cost over $500 bills. 
The only blemish I noticed is that the EQ Knobs are not recessed or enclosed which could be a problem when loading or shipping. You have to be careful how you load them for transporting.                
Wow! These speakers are the sh*t! I'm a mobile dj and I'm running these bad boys with a Crown XLS 1000. I don't even have the mixer volume close to half way and these speakers bump and the sound clarity is superb! I'm very impressed!!!                
Plug & play. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure this out.                
Straight forward. Took it out of box, plugged them in and heard nothing but beautiful music! No learning curve here folks!                
Excellent quality & not too heavy on the back. Perfect for any mobile or club set-up.                
You can't go wrong with these speakers. Buy them! You won't be sorry!                
No problems so far, but I did email Behringer asking about what other amps they recommended to efficiently run the speakers. They responded within half an hour and recommended the Behringer EPQ 2000 which I'll probably purchase.                  
Great design and doesn't look like your run-of-the-mill speakers.                
So far, so good. I'm very happy with these speakers! I'll probably purchase the Behringer EPQ2000 and a pair of Behringer subs to complete my gear.                
It has the low end kick for outdoor applications plus enough top end not to fade on vocals. A very good match for my PMP6000. Effects come through and instruments were clear enough to pre-set. I do a lot of outdoor gospel concerts with multiple bands.                
no accessories                
Lighter than my 12" Crates                
I picked up a pair of these almost a year ago to replace some janky no-name 10's I'd been using for small gigs and to host a weekly open mic.  They sound really great, are lightweight, affordable, and for the most part stand up to well for the heavy use they get - My one complaint is that they DO seem to scratch easily, though I do tend to toss them around.
Another nice bonus is that the angle on the cabinets is perfect to lay them on the side and use for monitors if needed.
Overall a great buy, and zZounds had them at my door in like 4 days with free shipping.                
Sound is Flat.
I think that it is the most important thing in a speaker, of course, later than wattage.                
One feature very extraordinary for a speaker in this price and wattage range is...   the light-weight. Only 38.6 pounds (17.6 kg). 
Too, It has 2 plug and 2 neutrik ins, both bridgeable; it has 2 handles very useful, Besides, you can lay this speaker as monitor on the 2 sides, because the speaker's shape is symmetrical and the Ins are on back-side. And you can mount it on (35mm)pole-stand too, or even hang it of ceiling because it has a special screw for it on top-side.                
Totally                
As I told you. The sound is Flat. And when you need bass or treble, this thing really responds.                 
As always with the Behringer products that I have bought, 
the Worth for your money is the Principal feature in this company.
If I could qualify it in this category with 11 or 12, I'll do it.
There are only one kind of behringer products that I don't recommend: the digital products. They are not good still. sometimes they fail.                
I didn't need them.                 
A lesser price. I'll never tire of that.                
If you need a stage monitor: buy it.
If you need a full-range PA speaker for a small-medium hall: buy it. 
If you need a high-pass PA speaker for small-medium-large hall: buy it too. (You can buy 2 pairs of B215XL and they are similar like 1 pair of old JBL215 concert, about wattage). [of course, the principal difference between the JBLs and 2 pairs of these, it is not the sound quality, it is the directionality of highs].                
Wow, sounds killer, and for the price its a no brainer!                
snap on rocks, and no noise!                
lightweight and easy to transport!                
another wow! great build and no defects!                
primo value!                
great looking unit!                
I am a DJ in Denver and recently bought the Behringer B215XL's. I DJ'd my first wedding with them a couple weeks ago and They ROCKED! Crystal clear highs and the bass was deep and punchy! I bought the white ones and they looked classy!                
Upgraded to these and they are great... good lows and highs. When i was looking to upgrade weight was a factor and i can carry these with one arm. Got blems but i have no idea what the blem was as there is not a scratch on them and they both work great! Pretty impressed, so impressed i am looking at the 12's for smaller venues or to add too the 15's when needed.                
Excellent speaker!!!! Especially for smaller venues, however, I just recently dj'ed a wedding reception in a very large ballroom and you could hear clear vivid sound from front to back without blowing anyones eardrums. A perfectly crafted speaker in my opinion!                
Included two 25' speakon cables for free. I assume promotional from Zzounds. thank you.                
Plug and play. That simple. Just make sure you're using an amplifier with enough power and your set to crank these babies to their max.                
I bought the white speakers for dj'ing weddings. Adds a nice feel to the room and if the speakers get scuffed or black marks you can easily wash it off to look brand new!                
If I knew how well these speakers worked before I bought them I would have easily paid double for or triple for the quality of sound they provide.                
Yes. Behringer answered a few questions that I had about the speakers. Very good company.                
Love that this speaker comes in white. Perfect for wedding receptions!                
As long as it lasts I will be using this as my main speaker for small to medium sized events. Flawless.                
well how sweet it is or I say they are I have here Tascam cd recorder, now I can rock the house and record everything I dj even karaoke ,,most people like to here how they sound after they sing karaoke now they can I got everything hooked up to the Tascam recorder dual cd player,karaoke player, cassette deck and to mixers all hooked to Tascam cd recorder its so sweet my mini recording studio, thank zzounds for your help smart people will be on your site now so take care                
I paired the B25XLs with the PMP 4000 and now have a great sound system with loads of power. I run both recorded and live music through the system with great success. They have great range and sound as good as professional DJ systems that I have heard. It has enough power to sound good outdoors and has rocked a large conference room (75' x 75') without breaking a sweat.                
These speakers sound great! Up until several years ago I was leary of Behringer's reputation for quality. No more though. I think they got a bad rep (perhaps deservedly, I don't really know) but have since put out quality products. I own a couple of Behringer powered PA mixers and now these speakers and they all seem durable to me. Haven't gigged with the speakers yet so can't comment on that but I've run them in a large room with recorded music through them and they sound terrific. You can't beat the price but at the same time I would not pay a lower price for something if I didn't trust it to function reliably.                 
I was leery because Beghinger products are like Adam Sandler movies - You never know what type of quality your going to get. So far I'm pleased. I placed them directly beside other comparable brands (Mackie JBL QSC) and besides the slight nuances that each brand has they preformed well and at half the price. They appear to clip pretty easy but they never distorted or shutdown after 4 hours of constant music (MP3). I also used them for my 6 piece classic rock band and they sounded great. I was particularly impressed with the "throw" must front loads only sound good a few away.                  
I like the in - out - thru - XLR connections. I can see how the internal frequency controller might be nice to. They are built well (tank like)and weigh almost as much (bring a roadie)                
plug and play for me                
These large speakers feel sturdy.The controls feel smooth for a Chinese product. I didnt like the shiny black paint to test for lead (joking-but only kinda)                
Cant beat the price for class d amplification.                
don't want to give them a bad rating because I haven't needed their assistance.                
they look nice. they sound great. and they dont argue. whats not to like.                 
I hope they last as long as my mackies have (8 years and counting). At this point I believe I'm going to buy another pair.                
I have been researching speakers like the B2550's for a while. I needed a set of dual 15's for outside events. I have used JBL and EV single 15's in the past but since I have a set of behringer 18" subwoofer cabinets I decided to look into the B2550's. The thing is I could not find any reviews on the B2550. I did find reviews on the VP2550 which is a model down from the B2550. The B2550 is there Pro line. The Pro line has a black laminate on the outside instead of carpet. The cabinets are very well built. So I got a set and tested them out. The highs are very clean and clear and the woofers are crisp and punchy. Once I get some video of them at my next event I will post another review. My first impression though is you can not go wrong with these for the price.                
Maybe not 9/10 stars across the spectrum of microphones, but for the price...yeah, 9/10.                
Came with shock mount and windscreen in a sturdy case.  On-mic options are great for setting up according to environment and conditions.                
Pie...or cake, depending.  Easy as, anyway...                
Well made and sturdy for me.                
For the money...definitely worth it.  Several times over...                
N/A                
Classy, smooth, sophisticated-looking in its shock mount.  Only 9/10 because it's not black...                
Again, for the money, I don't know of too many comparable mics.  These price point microphone wars are doing a lot of good for the pro-sumer and home studio buffs these days; I think the B2 Pro is right there at the top.
Also, I encourage anyone reading this review to take note of the "Overall User Ratings" at the top of this list.  Look at the ratings for all the various categories EXCEPT "Overall"  Those 7 categories average out to 9.25+ at the time of my writing this review.  So, why is it that the "Overall" rating for this mic is only 7/10 stars?  That makes zero sense, but what does is purchasing this mic if you need a solid, sensitive and adaptable microphone for pro-sumer use.                
The sound of this mic is fantastic. I dropped it on a medium shag carpeted floor, and the gentle thud it made will be hard to reproduce in this price range. Seriously, comparing this mic to a MXL V57M (the only other studio mic I own), there is no comparison. The B2 comes through pure and clean, and the noise level? None. Zippo.                
I like the features of the mic, the low-freq filter, the attenuator, and the 3 patterns available are nice. The shockmount is pretty much standard, but is a qaulity built mount. The case is very high quality, and when you transport a condenser mic, you need that. Glad to see that Behringer put the extra cost in a well built, sturdy, lightweight aluminum case, with sized foam lining.                
I mean it's a mic, right. Easy to use though, the features are selectable from the outside, you can try different combos easily, without having to take a cover off, get out your headband mounted combo magnifying glass/spotlight to change patterns.                
Mic is very well made, no loose parts or blems. It has not failed to perform to this point, but I am very careful with the handling of the mic. You just can't throw around condenser mics like they're rag dolls. Will probably last a lifetime, givn the proper care. And if you use it for vocals, get a pop filter or some kind of screen. Condensers do not like moisture. And don't spill beer on it, it won't like that either.                
I looked around for a good quality studio mic, and read a lot of reviews. From what I read, Behringer is not the defacto studio mic that every recording engineer dreams of, but is one of those sleepers, that once it is tried is found to rank right there with the big guns. For the price (don't you hate that phrase? what the heck does it mean?), you may not find a better value. Oh, you can pay less, especially in the used market, but why do people sell used mics? That's what I thought, too.                 
Haven't had to use it, so that's a good start.                
It is a nice looking mic, not small by any means, but has a healthy, sturdy look and feel. It looks impressive, even if it's not black. A little bit of a throw-back look to the old radio days.                
I think I will be satisfied with the mic a long time, although I am sure I will supplement it. If this thing goes on sale, I will definitely buy another.                
yesterday i bought this microphone, and m so happy to have it for the price.  the sound response is very transparent, and clear, the only problem is that i need to build a vocal booth as the b2 pro is very sensitive., as i have my studio in my bed room. its an excellent microphone for the price  but sound quality is like high end microphones                
This mic allows me to record the true sound of my voice, which I haven't been able to achieve up to now. For the price, I am amazed at how good it sounds. I couldnt get it to come through my PA system clearly without feeding back when I tried to use it for a live performance, but thats not what it was made for anyway. I recommend this mic to anybody who wants a pristine vocal sound from their home studio.                
If you know how to master... you dont need any other mic than the one you see here. Dont waste your money on high end mics if you dont know how to master. This mic leaves you with great raw results... no mastering... so if you can master it... nothing more than good condensing a little reverb and a few others than your good. I highley recomend this mic.                
I record live music - a lot. I average at least a thousand songs a year, all recorded live. I have more expensive mics, but I use the B2s probably 90% of the time. I've used two of these mics for about 6 years now, mostly on drums, and they've performed flawlessly. I have absolutely no complaints. None. Nada. 
The shock holders work great, too. I really can't emphasize enough how good these mics sound and how easy they are to use. If you're on a budget the B2 you should seriously consider this mic.                
The sound quality is superb very close to a Nueman mic.  I use this mic in my (DAW) Digital Audio Workstation home recording system.  And I have always had faith in Behringers products and this is the best bang for the buck.                
If you are looking for versatility then this mic definitely has what you are looking for.  Whether it is for Acoustic Guitar,Vocal etc this is the mic for you.                
I would say that most of Behringers products are made extremely well with German technology.  Anything that Behringer makes is to me top quality for the price and you can't beat it.  Behringer is definitely the Musicians Friend because they cater to musicians who don't have a lot in their budget for top quality equippment.                
This is the "Best Bang For The Buck".  You can spend thousands of dollars on Nuemans,Rodes etc and the list goes on.  Or you can spend $150.00 and get a good quality mic for a awesome price.                
The Behringer support believe it or not is the best on the planet.  I have had problem with some other companies with support but not Behringer.  You see I needed another shockmount for my B2 Pro because the cable snapped on the mount.  And I called Behringer and told them and they were on the case right away.  They sent me another shockmount free of charge and that included shipping too.  Now you can't beat that for Fantabulous service.  LOL...                
The color of the B2 Pro is very indentical of the Nueman and Rodes etc.                
Now overall there are certain mics for different situations.  Like for Vocals,Acoustic Guitar,and certain drummer pieces and Electric Guitar and Keyboards this mic is perfect for.  If I was using a mic for a floor bass drum and a bass amp then I would use a AKG (D112).  Because that particular mic is good for low frequencies.                
I have used this mic to record male vocals and acoustic guitar so far and the sound is incredible.  I own several Condensor Mics and this one so far takes the cake.  Totally impressed with the sound, especially for the price.                
You can't find a mic of this quality with the variety of features that are included.                
I think I have finally found the mic to compliment the vocals I need to record and I did not have to spend a fortune to do  so.  Very impressed.                
You won't find a better mic for under a grand!!!!!!!!                
I own several Behringer products; from mixers to effects units, never had a problem with support.  Thanks Behringer!!!!                
I am definitely going to buy another one of these.  This mic is outstanding.                
You can't beat it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Unless you want to take out a Home Equity Loan!!!!                
I've done music and broadcast recording with this mic and the sound is spectacular! I went to college for audio production where I was able to play around with all sorts of expensive microphones and I can honestly tell you that this behringer ranks right up there with all those expensive mics!                
All the features I need to do professional recording. The case is an extra bonus, the shockmount is great.                
Behringer really knows what they're doing, very solid construction (I accidently knocked over the micstand once and the mic hit pretty hard, but it still sounds brand new). I have nothing to worry about with this one!!                
I feel like I stole this thing for the price I paid! I would take this mic over any other under $500.                 
Don't think I'll need support, their products are THAT good!                
Couldn't do without it, I think I'll buy another.                
I would definitely replace it if I had too. For the price and quality, you just simply can't beat it                
I've only used this mic for vocals (mostly hiphop and R&B) and it sounds pretty good.  I mean, you get what you pay for, of course, but for as bad a name as Behringer gets from my fellow audio engineers, they do supply beginners with low beginning budgets with semi-decent sounding equipment.  I recorded a whole album on this, and as a demo/mixtape quality recording, it came out pretty good.                
Come on...for this price you get 3 polar paterns, a pad and bass rolloff, the shock mount, and the durable case.  That's a good deal...great features.                
Like the man above said...it's a mic...plug it in and use it, it can't get much easier.                
For the price, the quality can't be beat.  If you got a little more dough though, I would definately go for a better mic, but starting out, you can't beat what you get for this price.  Also, I had a drunk artist drop mine on the side of my desk, which put a dent in the grill, but the mic still works great.                
Again...great value.  What you get for this low price is unbeatable.  The sound quality & features to money ratio works out in your favor here.                
None needed...the best kind of support.                
It's a cool looking mic, and it has a wow factor to it, as long as the person you're recording doesn't know anything about Behringer.  People give Behringer a bad name because it's cheap, and the quality is not all that great for Pro Audio.  When it comes down to it though, on a budget, it'll get the job done, and it looks professional grade to the untrained eye.  It's not gonna get you laid, but it could get you paid.  (A little bit)  :o)                
I give it a high score because it's great for the money, but it doesn't get a 10 because of course, you can do soooo much better with a bigger budget.  To start out though, you can't beat it's price and it gives decent enough quality for a demo, and for mixtape quality CDs.  If music is just a hobby, this is a good mic for home recording, and once you've got more experience, and more money you can upgrade to something better.  I've had nothing but good experiences with it though, and look at my first condenser mic with fondness.  All in all a good buy...I've never regreted the purchase for a second.                
Most people are so stupid about the proper use of mics ,I'll bet if the same people putting this mic down saw Newman as the name on the thing would say its the best they ever used. I owned the highest price microphones and a few low cost and some times the cheaper mic sounds better.With a few exceptions the only thing about this brand is you either get a good one or a bad one so you need to try the exact mic out before you buy,I've had this brand and was satisfied and I've had this brand and threw it away.But I will say their mic that looks like a shure sm58 sounds better then the shure I know I tried a side by side test and I own probably 40 shure mics.They had a good 8 channel tube out board saturation but quit making it. 
Good Mic for any price if used properly.                
Plug in and use.                
 Built as good as most.                
For what you pay it's the best.                
Never used it.                
I don't anymore mics as I have plenty of all sorts of mics.I don't even know how many I have a hundred or so, and I don't need any more.                   
for ever                
This is a very nice mic for the price. I have recorded acoustic guitar, vocals and drums (the B2 and a SM57 behind the drummer and one SM57 in bass drum)and all sounded great!                 
Everything you need.                
Sturdy construction                
Very happy with this product for the price                
Happy with this mic                
When i first bought this mic the sound was Flawless no more studio dollars for me, but now i can get rid of the horrible mic signal and i'm picking up a lot of air i think it's the sound card though                
You are able to change the sound using switches on the mic, definite plus                
Doesn't work well with the budget cables but when i got more expensive cables it Rocked                
I think it sounds as good as some akg's i've used in studios                 
I don't call the company i call the store i bought it from and they are a huge help it's pretty popular with the retailers (prosound magazine)                
I actually make a lot of money charging people to record they look at it and think it's worth thousands                
I Will probably use this mic Until a B-3 comes out, better than the B-1 spend the extra cash                
Clean, spit clear sounds. Transparent too                
It comes with a spider mount, wind shield and a stylish metal case.
It has 3 polar patterns (omni, cardiod, fig.8), low cut filter, and pad.                
Its made pretty decent, solid construction and look.                
GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY!!!!!                
No problems with it so far and I don't forsee any...                
GREAT!!!!!                
For a long time even after I upgrade to an AKG                
Never thought i'd stoop so low as to use a Behringer microphone.I mean,150 dollars for a mic,a case,a pop-up and a shockmount?There's gotta be compromise for that,and to make you sure,there is.
The company says this mic sounds fresh and transparent,but as other experienced engineers,i do not believe them.Why?Because the High-Frequency boost on this mic actually accentises some of the worst sounds a human can make!As every other Behringer,it sounds kinda nasty.Not terrible,but adds a slimey feeling to the sound.                
Hey,150 dollars...why did i get this mic again?Oh yes,i remember: The accessories.Costs me LESS to get this microphone than all of the accessories separately,and albeit they aren't pro quality and all,they get the job done.                 
It's a legend of mythic proportions that Behringer build-quality sucks,and may assure you that this is NOT a Shure. The build quality takes the expenses for the price.Many people here say that this mic is well-made,but compared with my c414,it sucks big.                
Hey i know i dissed behringer but this mic is good for beginners.Add the accessories to that,and you got a descent package for the price.                
How come always you ring no one answers?                
Good-looking mic,though i'll give it an 6 because it's a Behringer.Record demos with untrained musicians on it-they'll think it's at least 2000 dollars. Call in a pro and he'll leave as soon as he smells it.                
If you're on a really tight budget or a beginner,get this mic!It might not be a NT1 or a AT2020,but will get the job done,and you won't look for another mic in a while.                
this product is very very unstable, i have two of it. after two month i buy, it become noise but will work normal at -10dB, but have noise like "pop....pop...pop...pop...pop.." in few second every few minute. and have pool service in singapore and malaysia.                
very well !! got all the accessories we need!!                
just about the realibility!!  ??                
they are sleeping all the time!!                
This mic is extremely versatile and has great tone with great tonal possibilities. Technology has afforded usthe oppourtunity to have some of the best of the best! This seems to be a Neuman copy with out the Neuman price.                
First of all it comes with case, Shock mount and windscreen. The roll off switch/pad and selectable patterns are a great asset.                
This mic is built like a "Hummer". Solid feel with good finishing contruction. Connection is good!                
The price is very comporable especially do to the fact that there are so many Chinese made and mics in this price range. But remember this is German Technology.                
Have not had to use tech support yet!                
Very Elegant and solid to touch!                
My two Behringer B-2's are a necessary part of my microphone arsenal and will always be!

It's quite clear, and reproduces the entire freq range accurately, but it still sounds Chinese to my ears. I loathe the boost in the upper midrange. It sounds harsh and overly present. For this reason I limit the use of this mic, and when I do use it, I meticulously smooth out that boost. That all said, it is a solid mic. It has stood up to some minor mods that I have done to it and the circuitry is made with quality components. This is not a studio centerpiece, and wouldn't recommend it as such to anyone, but serves well as an all purpose condenser in the clutch.                
Polar pattern switching makes all the difference. I would find little use for it without the omni or fig-8 patterns.                
It's a condenser...                
Should you crack it open, you would find it is very mod-friendly and made to be looked at. The components are pretty high end name brand. Has taken more of a beating than I imagined a condenser could.                
Good value. I would recommend another comparable Chinese mic in this price range. Go with SP for a better stock sound.                
Never used it.                
Decent looking.                
I have been equally frustrated and satisfied.                
I'v used two of these mics as a spaced pair for room.  I get this electro staticy sound especialy in the high end.  I would recomend the MXL990.                
The switchable poler paterns are a real plus!  you don't see that at this price level.                
These are good microphones, and amazing value when you consider what you get for your money - case, shock mount and wind shield included. For field recording they are pretty well ideal, offering three pick up patterns plus a -10dB pad, and solid construction. I have yet to drop one on something solid, but they have survived being bounced around in transit and still work out of the box. The slight peak in the frequency response helps compensate for the deficiencies in my recording equipment, so, whilst not flat 20 - 20000Hz they're more than up to my requirements.                
This mic has the best sound of all the LDC in its price range.  You get a very nice, crisp sound in the upper freq. and is a great studio instrument mic.  Vocals come off with a great full sound.  The mic responds very well to EQ.                
Most mics in its price range wouldn't dream of coming with 3 patterns for recording.                
The  mic is very well built.  The case it comes in, although a bonus, is a little on the cheap side.  The shock mount works very well for the mic too.                
Best mic for the price.  Pluse you get the shock mount, screen, and carrying case.                
I would rate higher, but have only needed to use Behringer's support once for a mixer.  It was your average support, nothing great, nothing bad either.                
The mic has a very polished look.  You could put in an assortment of other much higher priced mics, and it would blend in well.                
I'm very impressed by the mic that Behringer has put out.  A lot of studio buffs hate Behringer soley for some of their buisness practices.  Don't under estimate Behringer's products.  They are great for the price, and you will be very pleased with them.                
this mic is awesome on voice recording using omni cartridge.  it's got a very flat response-it has absolutely no tinny upper end-it's real smoothe and excellent on acoustic instruments as well. with pad it's max spl's  are 150 !!                
you also get a cardiod cartridge-  for 90 bucks this small condenser mic sounds alot better  on vocal recordings than a Rode NT1A  and the At30305 by Audio Technica which by the way both sell  for200 bucks and are strictly cardiod!!                
there's no other mic that can compete dollar for dollar.                 
I'm going to get at least 4 of these .                
Versatile microphone - good for stage - Okay for solo - best for choir or micing instruments. I use it for a Bell choir.                
Interchangable head makes it very nice to carry for multiple uses.                
Cannot allow just anyone to change the head. The threads can be stripped.                
two mikes in one!                
This is a pretty good dual capsule microphone for $90.  I have compared it to the Oktava MK 012 and the Studio Projects C-4, and there is a noticeable difference in sound quality: the MK 012 sounds better than the B5, and the C-4 sounds better than the MK 012.  The B5 It is worth the $90 asking price, but paying more will get you a better sounding mic in the SP C-4.                
Fully equipped with dual capsules, pad, and bass roll-off switch, and case.                
Seems very well crafted.                
Worht the asking price in today's market of high-quality, low-cost mics.                
Behringer's tech support peoiple are not always terribly well informed.                
I will find a use for it.  Probably micing tambourine and other percussion for live performance                
Very flat, no advertible coloration, only a bit plus at 10-13KHz.                
For this kind of mike has got everything!                
Plug (+48 phantom) and play!                
A real bargain                
THIS MICROPHONE DEFINITELY EXCEEDS THE PRICE/PERFORMANCE GAUGE.
 IT WORKS EXTREMELY WELL ON MICING ACOUSTIC GUITAR AND OTHER ACOUSTIC
STRING INSTRUMENTS. IT ALSO WORKED BEAUTIFULLY ON VOCALS WHEN USING 
 THE OMNI CARTRIDGE!! YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG WITH THIS MIC.                  
 THIS MIC COMES WITH AN OMNI DIRECTIONAL AND A CARDIOD CARTRIDGE WHICH
  BOTH WORK VERY NICELY.  THE MIC ALSO COMES WITH A MIC CLIP FOR USE 
 WITH A MICROPHONE STAND AND A FOAM POP FILTER.                
 THE B-5 IS MADE PRETTY STURDILLY.  THE CARTRIDGES SCREW ON AND HAVE
GOLD CONTACTS WHICH CONNECT TO THE MIC BODY.                
 PRICEWISE AND QUALITYWISE YOU'LL DO WELL WITH THIS PRODUCT- IT'LL
 BE  MIC THAT YOU'LL USE IN YOUR STUDIO THAT'LL DO THE JOB. MY 
 PREFERENCE IS USE THE OMNI CARTRIDGE. IT HAS A MORE OPEN AND FLATTER
  RESPONSE.                
 I HAVE HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER BEHRINGER PRODUCTS AND THE
 B-5 IS PROBABLY THE BEST YET!                
BUY IT.                
I do Karaoke as well as mix for live bands. these speakers do it all, excellent bass response and crystal highs. Would recommend to anyone needing a good set of primary speakers for there rig. Only complaint is the handles aren't deep enough for my hand.                
I got these speakers last week. Had 2 gigs on Saturday did a school PA function then Saturday night da sound for a live band. These speakers are awesome! Ran the vocals and the keyboard through the system sounded great. Haven't had a reason to contact Manufacture support                 
A couple of months ago I bought a pair of EV115P's from zZounds. I was never happy with them because no matter what I tried their sound quality was never what I was looking for in what I believed to be a better class of speaker than what I already had. Thanks to the great people at zZounds I was able to send them back and get a new pair of Behringer B615D's. I am now a firm believer in "Don't Mix and Match" when it comes to electronic components. The B615D's work so much better with my B18D Pro Subs. They are night and day over the EV's with my sound system. Previously I was using Behringer B212D's as the full range speaker, which for what they are, aren't half bad. I've had a lot of compliments over the last few years about how speakers so small could crank out such good sound and volume. But, in larger venues or outdoors people farthest away were always yelling "Turn it up". Well, I can tell you, NOBODY is saying that now! The B615D's not only have a tremendous amount of power compared the B212D's, they carry their superb sound quality and fill a large room and still have punch outdoors even at 100 feet. "IF" I were giving any advice here I would say don't make the same mistake I made in buying full range speakers of Brand Y if you already have subs of Brand X. That didn't work for me. Also, ALWAYS buy from zZounds, they have ALWAYS treated me with respect and have the best service anyone could ask for.
I haven't contacted Manufacturer Support - only rated it 3 because rating was required for Review.                
i purchased these in April 2016, happy to report almost 2 years later and tons on mobile dj gigs underneath their belt they are still cranking out the tunes. my secret, i keep them OUT of the RED, i also made my own speaker covers for them out of moving blanket materials ( i had my mom sew them up) as they scratch easily. my only complaint is they are a bit bigger and bulkier and heavier than my precious american audio powered speakers , and my fat hand barely fits the handles on the side (wish they had a nice top handle) but other than that these speakers pump nice, i use them with a 15 inch bass bottom, i keep the volume levels at 12 o'clock and use myDDJ-SX2 for the master volume with serato dj. good sound. i use them at various events of no more than 300 people, weddings, quinces, sweet 16, corporate, private events.                
I have "not yet" purchased a pair of these speakers but as a DJ myself I often go to gigs performed by others to see their performance and check out their gear. I heard these speakers in a medium size club where a young lady DJ was performing. Although I can't offer such a great review for her show I will attest to the strength and solid, clear sound of her B615D's. I was very impressed and will surely add a pair of these to my sound system ASAP.                 
Awful. I purchased two speakers and after a week of inside use (just sitting inside playing through some music at a low volume), one stopped powering on and the other started producing a popping sound in the mid.                
Stumbled on this guy by accident,what a find.If you're a flat wound player you'll love this unit,warms and brightens an otherwise dull thud.Have used it as a live DI and recorded direct with it,the engineers were surprised and impressed.                
Like another reviewer suggested phantom power and mid-sweep would be nice,but at this price I' very happy.                
Not being a fan of digital units I love being able to experiment without having to go thru a series of steps just to change sounds.                
Seems pretty solid,not that I'm planning to throw it around.No problem with the knobs or jacks.                
Every working bassist should have one of these.                
Don't know,haven't needed yet.                
I own it;depending on the gig my rig may vary,from 1-12 combo to 400w 8-10 cabinet,the BDI21 is first in line on all.                
I wasn't looking when I found the BDI21,will probably order another.Works great over-driving organ patches on digital keyboards.I gave straight 9s' because there's always a better sound to be had.I'm a bit old school,a creature of habit,so I can see using this unit for a long while.                
I had just spent over $3,300.00 on PA equipment, mic cables, stands, etc and ran out of $$ for a quality (expensive) bass guitar DI pedal. I did my due dilligence online, and at 1st bypassed the Behringer BDI21 because the price was too low and I am of the mind that "you get what you pay for."Long story short, (too late for that) I ordered it from zZounds. It arrived right on time. (Nice job, Z!) I was really surprised at the quality of it's solid build- I thought it would be a little flimsy due to the low price, but that was not the case at all. The I ran it through the mixer and into the PA, and was really shocked at what this pedal put out in tone, clarity and power. Like- "No way."I actually bought it for a bass player friend to use when he jams with me. He has a prosthetic leg, and this would enable him to leave his amp home when he jams with me. I am a lead guitarist, so I wanted the bass player's reaction and opinion more than my own. He came over and started jamming, using my cheap bass guitar to test it out. I kept adjusting and tweaking the tone controls while he played. I was able to dial in a very real Marshall, Ampeg, Fender and other bass amp tones. He plays a "Ricky" bass and I dialed in a "Ricky" sound using the Ampeg tone I was tweaking- he stopped playing and said "you gotta be kidding me! This dam* thing is unreal!" This guy is never easily impressed with anything or anybody. I have rarely seen a product have this kind of quality for this low of a price. If you need a bass DI box and are looking at the expensive one, do yourself a favor, save your $$ and get this little tone monster.                
This pedal seems to have been based off the tech21 sansamp pedal. It may have a little more gain that the sansamp. I have had great results with the pedal in terms of tone. It delivers that great sansmp tone without a problem. The casing is made of plastic as is the switch, so if you're going to engaging the switch often then it may be a problem. I keep mine on all the time, so the switch won't be an issue.                
I use mainly a Line 6 Variax 5 string into a GK1001RB amp. I was never happy with the low end on the GK...sort of sterile. I play classic rock and blues mostly. 
After two years of living with it, I plugged the Behringer DI into the amp. The low end I was hoping for was there. Using the Behringer DI I am able to cop the SVT tone I had in the 70's, as well as the feel. It's become a valuable part of my rig. 
The DI works far better for me than the direct out on the GK, which I have used for years, both in pre and post EQ modes. The Behringer DI sits in the mix better. 
Set right, the Behringer DI gives me just enough "tube like" compression to smooth the tone and feel. 
My rig went down one night and I had to run into the PA only. The Behringer DI worked great.                 
I love the pedal, but would like it better if it had a midrange. (I'm a working amp tech, and may add one.)  There is an inherent mid cut that works most of the time, but in some venues it would be nice to add some mids. 
It would also be nice if it had the ability to be phantom powered. I may add that too.                 
It didn't take but a couple minutes to dial in the tone I wanted. The blend and gain settings take the most experimenting. I run the tone controls flat to start and just small tweaks of the tone controls is all that's needed to dial in my tone.                 
Plastic case, but as with all the Behringer pedals I have, I've never had one crack or break. Sure metal would seem nicer, but for the price, who cares. 
I've had mine for a couple years and have never had any problems.                 
This pedal is obviously a Tech 21 BDDI knockoff. $29.99 compared to $199.99. I tried this pedal out thinking if it did the job, I'd upgrade to the Tech 21. 
I never had to make the move as the performance of the Behringer is great. Low noise, great sound...                
I am a working amp tech, and have had to repair Behringer products. It has always been easy to get parts. Schematics aren't available to non-authorized Behringer techs. 
I will say that Behringer is a far easier company to deal with than Loud Technologies (Ampeg, Crate, Mackie, etc.) I even told a spokesperson at Mackie that it is a sad day when customer support from Behringer is better than that at Mackie. He sadly agreed. (I hear Loud is finally improving things.)                
Hey, It's a Behringer. Not too much sex appeal, but great value.                 
If lost or stolen, I'd buy another. It does a great job and sounds great.                 
The product performs as described. The signal strength is boosted for basses with passive pickups. I rated it a 9 since I do not have another bass direct box for comparison. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this.                
Got this online. I’ve owned two Sansamp and was about to try and save to buy another one. It’s hard on a very limited income. I loved my Sansamp when I had one. It really helped the tone and Overall punch of my low to mid price basses. Coming up with over $200 for a new one was out of reach at this time so I thought I would give the Behringer a try. Wow I’m glad I did!! It does the Sansamp thing very well. Very happy with my purchase. Not My first Rodeo                
Works good with my gold tone micro Bass and Pignose 30 Hog Amp. It gives it just enough punch to make the small amp sound bigger and that is what I was looking for. I play Bluegrass and wanted something as close to the upright Bass sound as I could get. With this combo I get what I was looking for. I'm sure it does much more than I will ever use. Good Item at a good price.                
Pedal works great and I can get a variety of tones from it...only negative I have is that it does not come with an ac power source. But for the tonality I am able to achieve I am not holding that against Behringer.                
I ordered from zZounds in early December 2014 with the free shipping. Remarkably it arrived in 2 days, when I was expecting it to take a week, so zZounds is one of the best sellers shipping wise. As for the bass di, it sounds just like the Sansamp bass driver di (which is exactly what I was looking for) it's only $30, and it is functional. The only problem is that it only works on battery power, I have tried tons of adapters (including the behringer model) and it will not produce sound with any (though some activate the red led). Overall this is a good di for $30 if you don't mind using 9 volts.                
Sturdy build, easy to use, gets the job done for a reasonable price.                
I bought this Di box over a year ago and I cannot tell enough how great this piece of equipment works.  I can dial up the recommended settings and can easily tweek those setting for ultimate sounds.  Like I said, I can't say enough.                
You can get a lot of different tones out of this thing. I bought it to just basicaly see what it could do. I was very surprised at the different tones that it could produce. This is not a SansAmp Bass driver, but it is for sure as good as most any other pedals as far as giving you varied tones that sound really great.                
It is pretty straight forward as far as features go. You have knobs, that turn and a switch button to tur it off and on.                
Gravy to use. If all else fails look at the paper Behringer gives you with it. The paper has several different to settings. If you can read you can set it up. It's that simple.                
It seems to be put together pretty well. I would not abyse any of my other equipment, so I wont abuse this. It seems fairly well constructed.                
The price is dirt cheap for what you get. this thing will work for about 90% of all Bass applications.                
I have never needed it.                
N/A                
Absolutely LOVE this product! Playing through my GK 400RB and GK 15" and 2x10's with an inexpensive Ibanez Mikro bass short scale, I can tailor my sounds to no end! I can't believe I didn't use this product ealier in my playing years!                
Been using this pedal for about 6 months now and cant find any reason not to like it! It works great, almost totally silent, and can really give a wide variety of tones as well as some serious gain boost. Highly recommend this pedal!                
It does work pretty good, but can get hissy if placed wrong in your pedal chain or if you crank it too much. It will squash your signal though if you need it to. Will also hiss if the gain or treble knobs on your amp are set too high. Leave the enhance knob off and the level knob about 10 o'clock on the pedal and all is good! Not to bad at all and would recommend.                
I play bass with an overdrive pedal and this Behringer BLE400 really put everything under control. The Enhance knob lights up your tweeters. That's cool if that's what you want. You can have very little compression or squash it like a bug. Very effective. It sounds good clean also. Great for pop and slap. Really cleans up my sloppy picking style bass playing and levels out my finger style playing.It's all plastic so be careful with it. Battery location is weird but works.                
      I have heard very good things about Behringer products over the years regarding amps and rack-mount processors and such, but I have never owned anything till now.
     For the price of this little plastic, green pedal it is worth a try, but that is about all. The ratio and threshold settings work together for very minimal compression or sustain effect. The enhance feature emits a very noticeable "hiss" beginning at about a 10 o'clock setting that gets louder the more it is turned clockwise. The level feature of this pedal is really the only useful of the four knobs. Using this inexpensive pedal as a pre-amp is not a bad idea, and works in that regard and is the only reason that I did not return it for credit.                
I was using an Arion distortion pedal, and was dissatisfied with the sound, and decided to order this one. There is a world of difference between a distortion pedal and an overdrive. Where the distortion just created noisy breakup, the overdrive creates the sound of a tube amp pushed hard, just as promised. You can't beat the price either. I would highly recommend this pedal.                
Have been using this pedal for about 6 months now and couldn't have hoped for anything any better! It puts out just the right amount of grit without full blown distortion. Good quiet pedal as well. I now own 3 of the Behringer pedals and they all work great! Would replace it without hesitation if something happened to it.                
I bought this amp to replace my MB500 (I sold it) and I must say I am pleasantly Impressed and Overjoyed with my purchase. Let me explain why I bought this head, I own a few GK amps(1001rbll,MB200,MB500(sold))that am very happy with the 200 wasn't enough power and the 500 was sometime not enough but the 1001rbll was too much and I've blown some cabinets with it, so I needed somthing with enough power that could be versatile for small cafes to outdoor events and thats where Behringer came in 2000 watts under $400 great, but how did it really sound. I could have bought another MB500 but spending another$500 was out of the question. The Behringer has the power and additional features that make it surpass my mb500 and it was $200 cheaper with a 3yr parts and labor warranty(no brainer)its the best option for me. Its light,tons of power,sounds great,and a reasonable price. I was looking at the Bugera Vehron, but Behringer owns them and their technology is in the BX2000H. My brother used my bx2000h and was blown away by the sound,features,and power that he ordered one to replace his Jeff Berlin. and yes he's a professional bass player also just listen to stephanie mills'Home, yup thats my brother on most of those recordings, his name is Doug Grigsby lll. Anyway he was so impressed that he bought one also. Its a great value, I cant speak on CS as I haven't had to use them. Just my .02.                
I must say I was surprised when I fired up the BX2000H head.  I connected the amp to 2  2x10 Hartke hydrive 500 Watt cabinets, and I used my Ibanez SR1305 5 string bass.  I took a few minutes to find the sound I was looking for, but I was able to dial it in pretty quickly.  The amp is very easy to use and has lot's of power.  My gain and master never went above 1/4.  There was no hiss just quiet power.  For the Dollar this amp is a great purchase, but I also have the Hartke TX600 bass amp which is awesome!!!                
I am in no way a professional or super knowlegable when it comes to bass amp heads. I have played on a few different amp heads at my local music shop. Of course I played the ampeg, fender, and hartke heads, and of course they are all good and I am certain there are those who prefer them. However I am not a pro or am I made of the money to be able to purchase the higher priced amp heads and be able to afford the cabinets to go with them. I had seen this Behringer amp head on line and read the reviews and for the price I figured I couldn't go wrong. Thanks to zZounds highly rated customer reviews, Payment plans, and promised fast shipping. I gave them my business and bought this amp head along with the Bugera BT210. Now after only a full day of playing around with it I am running around like a child with a sweet tooth in a candy shop!!! I absolutely love all the sounds and tonal variations I am getting out of this amp. I couldn't be happier with the Behringer amp head or the service I received from zZounds.                
Lots of power. Very strong amp but very lightweight...about 10 lbs. Nice footswitch to toggle between a clean and slightly overdriven channel, or to add Ultrabass to either channel(sounds like a chorus effect). Great deal for the money. I have used many popular amp brands and this one is right up there in quality and easily the best for value.                
I play in a doom/sludge/metal/rock/whatever band so tone a clarity are important to stand out. I play on an Ibanez and a Dean bass, both sound great through this. I needed something that was easy on the wallet as well and this was the perfect find. The sound was dynamic and easily controlled. I was able to dial in the sound I wanted right away with ease. E.Q.ed correctly the distortion sounds just right and am able to match the clean to distortion pretty easily. I dont use the compressor at all as there is no need, and the Ultrabass adds a little kick to it but if turned up too much sounds wavy and like a weak chorus, which was my only complaint for the wide landscape type textures we create. Ive gigged with it a few times and still havent turned it up past the halfway mark, it can definitely push some wattage and even wowed my friends who have been doing this 20 plus years. Overall this is a great bass head for metal, as far as other genres I cant really give a review for..                
this top sounds great w/ my Eden 4x10 4ohm Cab...and for the price you can't beat it..    I am a Pro.Bassman...                
I bought this as a backup amp to my Ampeg, but I'm using this little powerhouse more because the features allow me to dial in any tone I want.
This amp has surpassed my expectations fully! You can't beat this deal for the price.                
I'm a retired lifelong musician.  Played professionally for 18 years, and now just an occaisional fill in locally.  I also work on guitars and amps in my local shop.  This little amp is absolutely amazing.  I can hardly  imagine it has 300 watts when I carry it, let alone looking at it.  I lugged around Fender heads, Marshall heads, Kustom tuck and roll heads, so I have a ton of experience lugging this stuff around.  Again, amazing...!  As for how it works, sounds, .... its very intuitive to use.   The knobs seem just ok, but work fine.  I say just ok, as I'm comparing this to steel chassis amps with conventional transformers.  I'm not sure how much wear and tear this amp will take, but again, its so light weight, you may just carry it in a large computer bag, so maybe it will go the distance, or maybe not.  But it does seem well made, so time will tell.
As for how it sounds and functions, I find the tone and volume quite acceptable, and I really like the ultrabass.  Just be aware you need some good cabs to push these low frequencies without speaker distortion.  I've played two basses through it, a 67 Gibson and a relatively new P-bass I built with Seymour Duncan pups.  It takes the lows of the Gibson very well, and frankly as good as any other amp I've used.  As for the Fender style guitars, it seems the highs are lacking, but not by much.  And it may depend on the cab used.  I'm currently using it with two cabs, a older Peavey, and a home brew 2-12 cab with old reconed square back CTS speakers.  I must say I'm enjoying it a lot, and for this price, I may buy another for a spare....just in case I drop this little jewel.  No other amp compares to this one for the price and function.  300 watts for $150 ?  Absolutely amazing.                
Just like the title...LOUD!!!!!! I bought a behringer combo amp years back with this same configuration and only 180 watts and that was loud.....so I knew what I was getting with this amp head but.....this thing is LOUD at 300 watts into 4ohms.... love the EQ compressor and dirty channel.... effects loop in the back of the amp....with DI...for the price...you can't go wrong....like I said...LOUD!!!!!!                
Needed something smaller that could still put out a big tone, this thing does all that an then some, fits in a backpack and is super light.                
This very reasonably priced mic really impressed me. It has a nice warm tone to it, good amplitude, hooked it up with no problems and really liked the sound. An excellent choice for vocals, as a primary mic or a background mic.                
The pros at ZZ's were extremely helpful.  The mic was also delivered fast!  The Behringer C-1 is definitely GREAT bang for the money.  I use it to record my vocals, which are now cleaner and richer than with my previous mic.  I'm VERY happy with the purchase all around!  I've recommended it to a few of my colleagues.   Woooo-To-Da-Hooo!                  
I was surprise of the quality and performance I got from using the Behringer C-1.  It was not as good as my more expensive mikes but that expected.  This microphone is very good for home studio recordings.                 
I have two of these. I used them as drum overheads for years. I vocally tested them next to a Rode NT1-A. They handled transients as well as the Rode. The frequency response and clarity were pretty well identical. The ONLY difference between them and the Rode NT1-A is a slightly higher noise floor. As drum overheads or as an electric guitar cabinet mic that does not present a problem. Yes, I can afford more expensive mics now and I have them, but if these are all you can afford you won't be sorry. I haven't needed manufacture support, so I rate that as support in itself. Five years with no problems.                
Bought this as a 'warehouse resealed' model from Zzounds for just under $40. Having used it for a little over a month now, I certainly wouldn't pay more than that, and it's hard to be very positive about it's value even at that price. Here are my impressions.
The good: Pretty hefty item, feels solid. Included plastic& foam-lined case is actually better than I expected, offering reasonable protection. 
The bad: So-so sound. Can't expect stellar quality at this price, but what's most concerning is the fairly high self-noise level. The clip is flimsy and I'll be surprised if it lasts long. 
Bottom line: I bought this mic because I needed another for a casual recording session. I guess it's all right for such things, and it's always good to have another mic lying around, even if just to loan out. But if I had it to do over, would probably not buy this mic again.
ps - Zzounds required that I give a rating for Manufacturer support.  Haven't dealt with the manufacturer, so my rating there is meaningless.                
I bought this microphone for podcasting with guests. It works great, however, you need to face the microphone, so you need to sit side-by-side, rather than across from each other. (This could be solved by buying two mics.) Note: I could not get this to work in Linux until I install QaxMixer. Additionally, you really do need a stand for this microphone, so if you are going to use it for podcasting, be sure to buy a stand as well.                
This mic is great for the money. The Behringer stuff is built solid. Sure there are some lemons in the bunch but when they're good, they're a great value. Great clear crisp sound.                
Straightforward--plug and play!                
Plug and play!                
For the money I can't tell a whole lot of difference any more from the so called brand names. I have a $20 Behringer microphone I use in my band and I don't care if it gets trashed or stolen. But the sound is awesome! My snobby guitar player had an AKG he owned for 10 years. After hearing this one he ordered one and is keeping his AKG home for recording.                
Best bang for the buck!                
Never had to deal with them, my Behringer stuff is solid.                
uhhh, it's a mic?                
Great value for the money, solidly built! Buy it!                
Dont pick up sound hardly at all.                
Comes with software that doesnt pick up sound.                
Its easy to use, just plug it in and wait to record something you cant hear!                
Its made like every other peice of crap. This product is a rip off!                
Cant hear what you record and everything sounds farrrrrrrr away!                
These people cant speak english and its a waste of time calling!                
I was satisfied opening up the package and as soon as I sang my first song and realized it doesnt pick up a voice or guitar I was not satisfied at all. Very very angry!                
I had several of these mics, C1s and C33. They are all Behringer. They all sound like Behringer, and you might already know about the most famous Behringer quality. If you a clean sounding mic that does not generate a lot of hiss on your recordings, then stay away from this mic. This mic creates a lot of hiss on your reordings and therefore in my opinion is not useable.                
Well, the C3 has vairable patterns. But this is of no importance because the poor sound quality and the large amount of hiss this mic creates on your recoundings.                 
As any.... needs Phantom Power. The sound is what counts and what is important.                
OK, one must admit, this mic seems to be sturdily build, but this does not help because the sound quality of this mic can be best described as beeing horrible                
Instead of wasting money on this mic, or on Behringer gear in generall, use this money to have a night out, or give it to charity, or save up and buy something better.                
Behringer and support, these are two different things. Behringer wants you to buy their stuff, but the do not want to hear from you anymore once they got your money.                
I had some of them, I sold them for very little. No, I don't want any of these terrible mics                
For only a little more money you get something much better. Don't waste your money on Behringer                
If you like hiss, if you don't mind a very trebly sound, then get this mic. If you like a good sound, then I would recommend not to get this mic                
Features, as any                
Yes, you can use this mic as you can use any condenser mic. But how does it sound is the main question                
Its Behringer quality. So you don't know - will it still work tomorrow ?                
Spend a little bit more and get something better. Do not waste your money on this mic                
Behringer support is very bad, very bad. The simply ignore you.
Thanks, I do not want it                
Overall, its a Behringer. Its Behringer sound, Behringer quality. 
I do not recommend and Behringer product. Had too much bad experiences.
Yes, it is said these products are entry level. But also entry level products should be of a reasonable quality                
Very low self noise for an electret condenser. Excellent dynamic range. Very low distortion. Near ruler flat frequency response.
Great for drum overheads, sax, etc. with -10 dB pad, acoustic guitar without.                
Needs separate LF roll off and -10 dB switches, or at least a clearer definition of whether the -10 dB position includes the LF roll off, or not. I believe that it does, but still not sure unless I test it  with an analyzer.                
Plug and play. If it doesn't work, you forgot to turn on the phantom power or have a bad mic cord.                
Superb sound, construction, fit and finish.                
Sounds like you spent a whole lot more than you actually did.                
Don't know. This is truly a disposable device especially at this price point.                
Sounds great. Cost is near zero. Now if only Uli would shock mount some of these elements into a hand held with a two layer pop screen...                
Cost/performance ratio is great. Sound is great. Behringer is a disruptive technology force in the music industry. You may expect to often pay double up to 10 times more for products of similar quality and possibly slightly greater longevity.                
It has the best price/quality. Very good vor low budget recording.
Pro: it has a very smooth freq.char. which is esily to equalize. And very constant directivity between 500Hz and 5kHz for very good XY or ORTF stereo. With proper equalisation they sound really impressive on all kinds of classical music: big church organ @ 12mtrs distance with really deep bass (16'pipes), big male choir (45 men)+ solist @ 2.5mtrs away and 5mtr up, grand piano @ 1.5mtrs, or 30cms from hammers, standup piano @ 1.6mtrs or 30cms from the soundboard, classical solo singers (fi. tenor or VERY loud soprano) @ 0,5-2 mtrs distance. No distortion, with ORTF mode exellent stereo roominess (big church) and soundsource positioning (choir). Good sound compared to my MXL990.                
Stereo bar, pop filters. Both OK.
Missed inter-distance adapter for ORTF mode, and 90degr. adapter for mounting the stereo bar in parallel under the mike-boom in case the mikestand must be beside the soundsource. Made them myself. I must also make rubber-suspension for the stereo setup.                
Needs equalisation when more than 30cm away from soundsource, it then sounds to me like very expensive. Is easy standard procedure for me now.
    Equalisation:
When at 30cms distance only -2dB equalisation @ 8kHz needed, then very neutral and pleasent sound.
When at 1m distance or more it needs the following equalizing at my Phonic MU1202 mixer with positions: Hi: 10.30Hrs ( -2 dB@8kHz); Mid: 13.30Hrs (+1.5db@2.5kHz); Low: 14.30Hrs (+8dB@80Hz). Afterwards at home extra EQ before music-cutting on my PC: +3dB@50Hz / +6dB@30Hz.                 
XLR plug fitted difficult in only one of all my 6 Behringer C2 mikes. Good PCB, nice metal housing, feels good and looks impressive. Feels reliable. Can be used "on the road" i think. Cheap, so spare ones do not cost much.
BUT: DESIGNFAULT in microphone output circuit: XLR pin3 is grounded directly for audio, and the impedance on pin2 rises for low frequencies. Be aware: This impedance-unbalance will reveal very weak residual hum/noise from your 48V phantom power supply (if any) when0 used with low soundlevels (test it)! I modified XLR pin3 cricuit, and hum/noise now is further suppressed by 30dB into an undetectable low level. Now perfect! See my modification article on internet.                
Yes, absolutely.                
I informed Behringer about the problem and asked for modification. First time no real good reaction (pointed their finger towards my mixer). I devellopped modification myself: Second time when my modification was send to them, they respondede more serious and did send it to their devellopment department.                
Feels and looks very good, nicely small, only wanted sometimes it was black and less obvious to see, and less obvious printing on it.                
I will keep them. Becouse i want to make stereo recording in Blumlein mode, i will buy at least one set stereo mikes with figure-of-eight characteristic. Must wait for budget. If small budget, possably the cheap new Behringer C3 or the more expensive Superlux CMH-8C.                
So far I have only used these to record acoustic guitar and they do a much better job than I had originally expected,I have been able to produce a very woody natural sound both used as a stereo pair or with a single unit pointed at the 12th fret from about 7 inches away.
A few hints for the guy who trashed them. Read up on mic placement technique,learn how to work your preamp and or your mixer and you might be pleasantly surprised. By the way...they are not vocal mics!
The Included stereo bar alone Is almost worth the price of the total package and I use the 10db roll off switch to eliminate all traces of bottom boom on acoustic.                
Plug and play of course.                
The mics seem to be very sturdy and the fit and finish on my pair Is excellent.                
The price of these mics can't be beat for the quality sound that I have been able to produce with them.For a basic home recording setup that won't break the bank,I highly recommend them.                
I have never needed support on any of the several Behringer products that I have owned.                
I don't consider mics to be very sexy,but to each his own.                
If lost or stolen I would purchase another pair.As a matter of fact I'm thinking of purchasing a backup pair anyway.                
they are awesome guys, just don't miss them . i got a pair for 50 bucks including mic bar and etc... recorded my takamine acoustic guitar with my m audio fast track ultra and i got very clear, bright and natural tone. i am really happy with these. please get a good xlr cable with gold contacts.i have recorded with mogami gold cables.
good acoustic guitar +  good playing techniques + good cables + good mic techniques + good sound card = high quality audio.                
Nice smooth sound. Extremely flat frequency response. Very forgiving microphone.                
The only thing I wish Behringer had done differently would be to separate the lo-cut and 10db pad switch                
Useful right out of the box.                
For such a small mic, it has a nice heft to it. Real solid little unit.                
To get two of these mics for a fraction of the cost of what you might expect to pay for one is a phenomenal deal.                 
I haven't had to contact Behringer regarding this product                
Once you hold the C2 in your hand, you realize that it's not only a well made product, but that it may well be the cutest darn microphone ever made.                
I envision these mics being part of my recording rig for a long time.                
The sound quality is much better than expected at this price! They are O.K. as Drum Overheads, but sound really good on Acoustic instuments.                
I've had no problems. Seem to be well made and have a little weight to them.                
No, these are not Neumann KM184's but for the price you can afford to buy 2 pairs. With all of the tools in our arsenal to "beef up" our gear, these C2's are well worth the price!                
I have heard these Mic's are getting hard to find because Behringer is going to raise the price.??                
It is hard to believe two really great-sounding mics for acoustic guitar are available for $60, and from Behringer no less...but these are the real deal. This would be a steal at twice or three times the price. Comes with a sweet little case, double mic bar, and little windscreens! If you are looking for a pair of condensers on a budget, stop looking, buy these, they are wonderful.                 
I was looking in the market for cheap in price but good in quality condenser mics. I tried these out at the school I work in and I was convinced to buy these. They are like a small version of the $600 choir mics. I was going to buy another set from a different manufacturer for $100 but I ran across these and now I am happy. If you are looking for good quality mics for a small recording studio, these are definitely the mics to get for under $60. That is another thing, ZZ Sounds has the best price for these out there and free shipping.                
You can't beat the quality for the price!  Sure, you can buy some expensive condensers that are available on the market, but you'll have to spend WAY more to hear any difference at all. 2 mics for around $60, plus a stereo bar, you can't get a better deal than that.                  
See my earlier comment. Needs EQ on mixer and (if record pipe organ) also a bit on PC. Used them on choir XY/ORTF, harp XY, choir organ, big main organ.                
See EQ.                
Behringer responded promptly on my comment about poor output-balance. And improved newly delivered ones afterwards. Sadly did not award me by some gift (mikes).                
Nice, but want black ones.                
Still use them, after i modified the output cicuitry to get optimal balancing effect (suppression of noises from phantom power supply and induced hum/ticks on the balanced cable).                
I use these mics for overheads on the drum kit in the studio. They are great for the money!                
In 18 years, I've never been excited about the sound of a hi hat mic until I used one of these last night. It was very crisp and clean without being harsh. I used the other one under the ride cymbal and got exactly the sound I wanted.                
It would be perfect if it had separate switches for the high-pass filter and the pad.                
Plug it in, turn on phantom power, turn it up, done.                
It's got a little heft to it, but after only one use, it's a little hard to tell how long it will last.                
I can hardly believe I got two of these for less than the cost of a single "high quality" condenser.                
At this price, they are easily replacable.                
Wow. No really, excellent for guitar cabinets (especially any bass heavy cabinets), sound great as a stereo pair for drum overheads. Close in, they feel amazingly similar to a 57 (although I believe the sound is actually a little more focused on the Behringer)                
C'mon. A selectable 10db pad and a bass roll-of on a mic costing $25.                
Plug and play.                 
 Haven't had any problems.                
Again. The features and sound for the money are outstanding.                
N/A                
 If they would only make them in black....                
  Incredible value. I'm sure they won't take the abuse of a 57, but at 25 a pop, buy four of them.                
This mic is almost identical to the Neumann KM184 Cardiod, check out the specks and the sound, you wont find any huge differences.  For a pair of the Neumann KM184 it costs $1,459.  For a pair of these Behringer its $50.  Dont pass it up, this is a sick deal.  I've used them for micing my guitar and they're sound is great, the 10dB bass roll off switch is really helpful on the low end. I own really expensive mics, and not so expensive mics and this one has proven itself among the greats.  You gottta get um!                 
HUGE VALUE!!                
GET THEM!!                
I have been very pleased with these C-2 mics which I use to cover large and small choir performances as well as some instrumentals in live sound situations. Their cardiod pattern and good sensitivity fill the bill at a very attractive price. That's why I bought this most recent pair.  We now own 6 of them.                
These are great sounding microphones.....much better than I expected. Very natural and transparent.......these are exactly what I was looking for........overheads, acoustics, stereo recording and misc uses....                
Nice packing, storage case, pop filters and a very cool stereo mic holder......haven't used it yet, but looks like a worthwhile setup.                
Easy to use......just use phantom power, attenuation or rolloff.....the rest is all mic placement, levels and good source.                
Well made......feels substantial.....matched well.                
This is well worth the price......worth more actually!                
Have not needed support.....all the Behringer stuff has been working. there older stuff was lifeless, but they have been getting the transparent sound that I require and expect from semi-professional gear.                
I don't know if you can call it sexy, but it's built well, designed well and very easy to place in any situation.........Great!!                
I expect to have and use these as long as they last, which I expect to be a good long time, as I'm a fanatic about equipment care.....be nice to your equipment and get years and years of use.                
They work but there is audible hum. Not suitable for hifi recordings
imho.                
They look ok. Switch for high-pass is handy.                
Plug them into to a cable stick them on the supplied t-bar.                
Quite well made on the exterior.
Corners have been cut internally.                
They are super cheap but they sound it.                
No idea.                
No I don't want it.                
If you have decent headphones or monitors you will see how bad these
mikes are before you waste a lot of time recording with them.                
It has a clear small condensor microphone sound but there is a loud
hum ever present.                
Stereo bar, high pass filter and pad. Lot's of features for the 
money.                
Plug it into your XLR cables and apply phantom power, bingo.                
It looks robust enough nice metallic finish.                
It's cheap but due to the hum will create serioulsy low quality 
recordings.                 
Not contacted Behringer.                
If you know what type of sound you'd expect to get from these, you wont' be disapointed. Great acoustic/percusion sounds. Was impressed the first time using them.                
Nice stereo mount, everything you need it to do!! Don't think the case is meant to be used as a case!!....TIP when purchasing mics, keep the foam interior this will allow you to place all of your mics in a nice heavy duty carrying case.....it seems like they always use the same thickness of foam???....                
How to explain that one.......                
Solid built comparable to much more expensive mics......very impressed at this point.                
AAA+                
Have many Behringer products,.....impressed all the way.                
I have it....will buy another pair!                
Great tight sound for drum overheads. -10db pad and bass roll-off switches are nice features.                 
Phantom powered!! Make sure you have 48V phantom power on your mixer/preamp/whatever, otherwise, it won't work!                
great sounding item for this price??? 2 mics, an XY mounting bracket, windscreens, mic clips and a little carrying box make this a steal...                
It's a very flexible mic with a great sound for the price. You can literally stick it anywhere in live or recording sound alike. The best though is in mic-ing it close-up to an acoustic instrument. Might sound a little tinny with bright cymbals when mic-ing it overhead on drums though.                
The low-cut and pad is ultra-useful in my case, though i would like the low cut to seperated from the pad for more flexiblity...                
It's a very forgiving mic with a remarkably high gain before feedback. Very friendly with a standard 3/4 band semi-parametric EQ.                
No complaints on this one. Unlike some other Behringer products I've handled, I received no production defects on my 16 units (8 packs) I have currently. Feels like a million bucks and none of them failed in my shows for more than a year now. Even if it does, I'll just get another one. Great job, Behringer.                
The local dealer in Malaysia sucks with its support and warrantee with the other Behringer products i own. The only bummer of this mic actually.                
I run a sound rental company dealing with a great variety of live music, so my mics have to be great or else i'm screwed. However, being an asian country, looks and branding are still important as a advertisement. However, despite it being so cheap (By far the cheapest mic in my sound arsenal), it stands up against other mics so well i'm not embarrassed to it being there. Besides, it's rather cute.                
By far one of the best-valued products by any manufacturer I've met. Top recommendation from me.                
I use these for live sound in a small chapel with lots of reverb and they work great.
 - one for an overhead on a drum kit and I hear everything (the only other mic I really need is one for the kick) 
- another to mic a violin.  
After listening to the recordings I made it sounded like I was standing next to the insturments - amazing reproduction of the sound source - which, being an insturmentalist myself, is exacly what I want a mic to do.                
The mics came with everything I need or what for them what more is there to say.                
I just pluged them in and was amazed.                
The sound is great!  The 10dB roll off its really helpful.  That alone makes it worth the price.                
Once again the 10 dB roll off is excellent, and the sound is pretty crisp and clear.                
Easy easy                
I've done alot with um, and they can take a beating.                
Amazing value ofcourse.                
Overall i'm genuinely satisfied.  Good sound, good buy, good deal.                
Sound is good.  I bought these for stereo recording acoustic guitar which they do very well.  I was previously using a single shure small diaphram condensor mic and the C2's do a better job of picking up the wood and string sound of the guitar.  Acoustic instruments are obviously what these are designed for.                  
very neat and useful X-Y stereo mic bracket.  The -10db switch is good too.                
I love the small size of these mics.  they don't get in the way and are easy to handle                
They are simply but well made and I feel confident they could take a bit of abuse.                
These are by far the best bang-for buck microphones I have ever purchased.  I have been recording for 15 years and cannot belive what I got for $70AU                
never had to deal with support                
They look like a professional mic and I wouldn't be ashamed to be seem using them.                
Very satisfied.                
I dont see how anyone could give this a positive rating. It sounds like vocals/Acoustic guitar is resonating out of a tin can. It's really terrible, even when run through waves diamong bundle.                
garbage                
looks pretty cool                
disappointed                
For the money these are a good bang for the buck.  That having been said, it is what you pay for.  You are not buying Neuman mikes.  Therefore, to compare them to Neuman would be a disservice to both.  Because of the several options, cardioid, figure-8 and omni, these are performing exactly as I have need.  These serve as ambient mikes in a live setting for in ear monitoring.  With these set at front of stage with the figure-8 setting, performers are able to hear themselves in a "room" setting,  and they are also able to hear the audience.  They do it very well.  The indicator on the face of the mics is a great visual clue that "phantom" is on.  
Comparing them in studio to MXLs, the tonal quality is about the same, with the gain attenuated more for these to acheive the same output.  When compared to Octavas, let us just say that they really are in a different league.  The Octava(s), gain set at 12 o'clock,  had more output than with these set at 3 o'clock.  But again, keep in mind that what these are currently providing in an inexpensive package makes sense and cents.                 
The shipping box (carrying case) is very adequate for getting to me, but I immediately put them in a padded/divided mic case (SKB).  The mic holder is plastic, I would be careful in handling it.  Are they road worthy for an every night set up and tear down? probably not!                  
The switches appear to work well and do not anticipate any thing breaking but I also do not have any plans to need to change settings all to often.  Very possibly the only one would be the low cut switch should there be any low rumble transmitted to these.                
At the normal retail price I would probably pass on these for something with a little better specs.                
I have used Behringer boards for many years and have not had anything that would cause me hesitation to use their products.                
The chromed mesh has me a little concerned as to how long it will hold up.  I would have much preferred a more matte finish or black.  They would be so much less conspicuous had they been a matte black finish for what I am using them for.                 
So far what I have experienced with these, I would replace them with the same should something happen to them.  In cardiod pattern there is some low self noise with the other settings it is greatly increased because of the additional diaphragm being active.                 
The Behringer mic we bought for our congregationi is exactly what we were looking for and works perfectly in our application. And the switchable pick-up pattern allows us to use the mic in different settings without having to have two other mics. The figure 8 pattern  and phantom power is just a great way for us to interview two people with having two mics and the people don;t have to be standing close to this mic for it to pick up. All-in-all, this is a terrific mic!!                
I bought this Behringer C-3, but is is VERY noisy... I can't use it for anything else than recording hardrock! I think I will remove the PCB and replace it with my own low-noise head amplifier. The C-3 uses a TL072 as head amp, no surprise that you get noise. (The noise is even higher in the omni and fig.8 mode.)                
I purchased the mics, and was ready to return them within one hour.
One mic sounded fine, the second mic of the "matched pair",.. was
1/3 less volume, bassy muffled tone, and very fuzzy!                
The accessories were fine.(not much good unless the mics are usable though.)                
Not good unless you like the sound of A.M. static.                
They must not have been inspected!...What makes them a matched pair
if they are completely different?                
If they worked they would be a great value,....but again, not good if you can't use them.                
I had a little trouble, I filled out a more detailed description of the
support problems,....but my review didn't get posted!                
A good Ethernet cable, shielded and on a reel. I currently use it with my Midas M32 and DL32 and it works great!                
a little boxy, tell the truth. Pretty rich and full for the speaker size though. I wouldn't necessarily use these as studio monitors for mixing but they'd be excellent to listen to the mixdown in a room instead of near-fields. They could use a powered sub.                 
They can take a hit better than a set of monitors. They're lightweight and small. Behringer should include a handle in their hardware with these. 
They have RCA red/white in (they're mono, but if you have two one gets the red and one gets the white), balanced 3 pin microphone in and a balanced pin out for sending the signal to another speaker. 
I would like a 1/4 in, but you can't have it all, can ya. That's why Hosa maked an adapter for everything. 
The speakers have clip/limit protection, but I haven't gotten to that point yet. 
Get a few sets and daisy chain them with the buffered signal out, or daisy chain to a sub with built in crossover.                 
Unbox, plug in, RCA in, and turn on. That's it. Pretty easy if I do say so myself.                 
I was looking for something to PA around the house, something that my wife could use as a portable PA, and something I could possibly use as a sound reinforcement for my TV. These fit the bill on all parts, and are more rugged than home audio equipment or studio monitors. There might be a sacrifice of sound quality, but I'm not really worried about it.                 
Value is subjective, but for my personal needs, this is a high value. My wife would not be able to lug any of the standard-sized PA speakers to work in my price range. Fitment in multiple situations is minimal with the bulky thermoplastic powered speakers, and imagine how horrifying it would be to suddenly have a small child dime the volume on a Class D 1000w speaker when watching a sit-com. 
The main point however, is that there is almost no competitive-sized PA speakers on the market to this. It's assumed that the market doesn't want them because they don't buy them, but they don't buy them because they aren't sold.                 
Haven't dealt with them, and I don't expect much.                 
The design of these is such that they try to minimize Wow factors. They're supposed to be unobtrusive, like most business music reinforcement speakers. They're fairly rugged, fairly loud, fairly light, and very utilitarian. The wow factor is that they do their job.                 
These are kid-sized powered P.A. speakers that put out 80w (peak, I think, I imagine it's 40w program). Smaller than a shoebox for an adult foot, and a little over 10lb each. 5.5in driver with a piezo tweeter. They also come with hardware to mount to a wall. 
There isn't a lot of reviews on this Speaker. I bought 4 of them for a Meeting in a tennis clubhouse with 300 ppl. It was just used for voice and light music. I was blown away by the sound of these! The rooms were 40' x 60'  with hardwood flooring  and had 2 in each room. It filled each room with clear clean sound. In my sound test with music, they played louder then I expected. The music was clear, clean and punchy. Now you won't expect booming lows to shake a room, but these will make you take a second look. It had me thinking you can do a small wedding reception with them if you add a behringer 12" powered sub(s) they would do top ends nicely and clean and clear. You could also use one Speaker with just a mic for a simple PA. 
I had these running thru a Behringer XR12 AIR Mixer which is an awesome piece of gear as well. I had them daisy chained from the mixer. With that setup, you can do most events from weddings to corporate events. If add more pairs to the system it just gets even louder and even coverage.  I was able to find tripod adaptors that I could mount them on top of tripods and this made the system more portable.  I packed 4 of them in 27 gallon tote storage bin ($ 8.97  Home Depot) with all cabling as well.
My settings on the speakers were set to 1 o'clock on the dial. Even with the loud music peaks during the test, it never clipped. Even when I pushed them they didn't clip, they just got louder. The speakers do have limiters in them to protect them. Per Speaker puts out 113db on my sound test. Which is pretty loud if you get 4 of them. You can only imagine having 4 more of them. 
Over all this Speaker does what they say it does.  It pack up easy and sounds amazing. I will be using these for a mobile sound setups. These are good speakers and can't say enough.                 
There isn't a lot on line about these speakers. You know what the ads say about them and what they do.( If you use these for just speech, you will need .5 watts per person times (x) how many people will be there. This event 285 x .5 = 147 watts needed to be heard clearly. So 4 of these will be more then enough.)  But I'm here to tell how I used them. I just needed some small and portable for just Speech and light background music, for a crowd of 285. THESE SPEAKER ARE A HIT!! These aren't made to be just permanent installed speakers. I used them as a mobile speaker with tripod adaptors for mounting on tripod stands. 
I used a Behringer XR12 XAIR mixer with 2 mics and 2 iPads (One to control the levels and sound of the mixer. The other for Music) and 4 Behringer CE500Bk. The rooms were 40' x 60' and it was 3 rooms of that size. Hardwood floors but the chairs were set up in only 2 of the rooms. This system was clear, clean and no distortion what so ever. It can be heard thru out the facility clearly!  I had the dials on back of the speakers set to 1 o'clock . During my sound test I played music that had loud peaks and not one speaker clipped! The sound check with mics were equally impressive. During my sound test it was giving me 115db standing at various points in the rooms.
The sound of these are clean and clear with a punchy surprising sound that will make you take a double look. I can only imagine what 8 of these would do with a 12" Behringer Powered sub. You can get to party levels with the right equipment.  
These are really good speakers. They can be tripod mounted with the Rockville mounts on Amazon for 8.95 a pair. You can pack 4 of them, with all cabling, in a 27 gallon tote storage bin from Home Depot for 8.97. These don't have to be just permanent installed speakers you can do other events like wedding ceremonies, school functions, lecture halls, corporate events etc.... But if you want a party these can do so. I used 4 of these and I'm very impressed. I will get 4 more for larger gatherings. If you add a sub, your in party mode with these. If you need something light and portable, these will fit the bill.                 
My controller does not work with any dj program and also the headphone jack does not work.                
I needed to replace my Presonus Monitor Station V1. I was a bit concerned when I received the Behringer Control2USB and saw how much bigger it is than the Presonus; this thing is big! At 15.5" wide the Behringer is much wider than the Presonus - it takes up more desk space. On that note, I can say this this unit appears to be built like a tank! BUT, once I had it connected and started using it, I am SO glad I made the choice to try it. To me anyway, it blows away the Presonus, both in function and sound. What I was considering a possible downgrade from the Presonus is actually an upgrade! The Presonus has no USB connectivity like the Behringer and that's a huge plus; it just adds more functionality since I work 95% with DAW. I seem to get better control-response from my monitors as well (I use KRK Rokit 8s + a sub) I get twice the SPL response without having to play with the monitor's rear settings. I am assuming this is because of the VCA control in the volume control. The ability to switch meters between in and out is very useful, along with the typical studio features like talkback and source select. I really love this unit, even if it is a behemoth! I cannot say whether or not this matches the Presonus Monitor Station in actual sound reproduction quality, but I would have to say that it's pretty darn close. From the softest interludes and effects tails, to full blown screaming guitars, I can hear it all in detail the way I need to. The only drawback that I can see at this point would be lack of headphone outs - only two, where the Presonus has 4. The wow factor? Well, if you compare the price to features - I said wow! This is a real deal in today's music world. If you need to save some money but do not want to sacrifice real quality, this is a good choice! This unit will be setting on my desk for years I'd bet.                
It really (for lack of a better word) de-craps my playing.  I'm not saying it's a insta-shredding machine, but it helps.  I can get some pretty funky sounds out of it.  I LOVE playing me some Skynyrd with this, gets that perfect Sweet Home Alabama sound.  Also helps solos cut through the mix when playing songs like Mama I'm Coming Home.  Gives pinch harmonics more presence in songs like Scream Aim Fire.  Gives taps more presence in songs like Crazy Train or One.  It also adds a WHOLE lot of sustain especially in areas I needed like the last note of the Nothing Else Matters guitar solo.  That note lasted forever!                
Price was GREAT.  The sustain is amazing.  The compression is awesome especially when you switch from single notes to chords and then the chords are WAY too loud.  Plus it adds a whole new dynamic sound.  The 4 knobs do their job to help you fine tune your sound.                  
It's pretty easy to use.  No real need to use the manual unless you're gonna use batteries to power this.  Just gotta use your ears to find the sound that you want, simple as that. :)  MY personal setting is
Level - 3 o' clock
Tone - 11 o' clock
Attack - 1 o' clock
Sustain - 3 o' clock
Great sound, distorted or clean.                  
No cosmetic blemishes.  It's made of plastic, but that's to keep the price down.  The sound quality is pretty great, especially for this price.                 
I've had this thing for a couple of days now and it's gotten a LOT of use from me.  Especially because I hate the fact that my chords are so much louder than single notes (i.e. Good Riddance - Green Day)                
I haven't needed any support yet but I called them inquiring the warranty and they were very polite.                
It's pretty sexy if you ask me. (;                
I wont say it's the BEST compressor out there.  But for it's price, it's unbeatable.  If you have the money, then by ALL MEANS get the Pigtronix Philosopher's Tone.  But this thing is AMAZING!                  
I used to own this compressor. I sold it to a guitarist who didn't like it very vuch. I'm buying one or two of them again for keyboard and program use. (I like my autocom 2-channel rack compressor also.) The sound is quiet and nearly transparent- a little "glossy, creamy, pretty". I think less of it as a sustainer, especially compared to Electro-Harmonix's Soul Preacher (of which I own two), but this is quieter, smoother and cheaper, more to my general liking. it's decently built, cheesy knobs and all. I't won't likely be anyone's dream compressor, but when one can use less than the ideal, it never hurts to have a couple in your effects collection.                
I do not normally use a compressor, but I got this because of the sustain feature. I am still tweaking the comp part and may be able to use it. The sustain feature alone is a value and is great for soloing & leads.                
Simple and easy to use. Put this little sucker in front of your amp and it will turn a good high gain amp and 4x12 cabinet into instant head banging machine. A wah pedal plus this pedal directly into the front input and abra cadabra, zipity zam wish granted.                 
I've had this pedal for a couple of days now and I like it.  Easy to use.  Easy to find your "sweet spot"  Sounds great.                
This is an item I've been meaning to buy for quite sometime and when i saw it for that price i had to buy it and what a great Purchase it works great i have already found many bad cables in my Stuff so im very glad that i got it.                
I'm searching for silence when I'm not playing notes or when I'm not touching my guitar strings/ knobs, etc.Some is surely caused by my home's circuitry.I have weeded out any noise-causing (some quite expensive!) guitar cables using the Behringer Cable Tester.                
I purchased this unit to test my cables because I was getting a intermittent signal. I was tired of playing around with cables trying to find the cause. After I got this unit it nailed it right off the bat. For this under priced little wonder you would be crazy not to get it, your pedals, amp, and guitar will thank you. This unit is idiot proof to run, trust me I am not a sound engineer and figured it out within a couple of seconds with the tiny manual included.                
The first unit I bought was flaky - sometimes gave different results on the same cable.  zZounds let me return it and have it replaced.  Now I'm in business.
I checked all my cables and found a bunch of 'em with one problem or another.  Now I'm trying to get the respective vendors to replace the cables. Ha.
I also found a cable that I thought was bad, but apparently tests out OK.
I bought this device specifically because of its ability to test flaky cables, i.e. "intermittent" connections.  Very valuable, IMO.  An added bonus is the ability to check whether there is a connection between the cable shield and the cable ground.  Only 1 vendor of all my cables has such, and I found some cables with non-functional or flaky connections there  as well - even though that doesn't prevent the cables from working like the cheaper ones, it does show that something is wrong, and it would be very hard to detect that without a tester.
This tester has already given me a boost in the area of "peace of mind", and that 's a good thing because bad cables at a live event can be extremely stressful -- because it's real hard to figure out which one is bad - and whether or not it's even a cable that's bad, or whether its' something else!
The only thing I'd like to add is some more cable types - like speakon.
Also, the manual is pathetic.  It doesn't explain the lights well.  You have to check around the internet - like YouTube - to figure out how to check 1/4 inch guitar cables, for example.  These check differently than XLR on the tester.  It's absurd that they couldn't do a better job with the manual.                
Behringer CT100 Cable Tester is a practical item for any audio professional to have on hand. If you use Audio cables there is always the possibility of failure during their lifetime. When your equipment is set up and you experience unwanted noise or no signal is when this tester becomes your best friend. Audio cables are usually the weakest link in any system. This tool will allow you to pinpoint a defective cable or determine that it is functioning properly and allow you to save valuable time diagnosing audio problems. It can also be used to check our cables prior to installation in a permanent application or periodically if your audio equipment is mobile. This unit will quickly tell you if you have an open connection or a short as well. One nice feature is the tone generator that allows you to send a signal from the output of any of the multiple plugs to your amp. allowing you to test a cable in a permanent installation or long run without the necessity of having both plugs in hand. At the reasonable price I paid for this it is well worth keeping it tucked away in my road box until it is needed.                
I have had this unit for 3 years now and never had a lick of trouble with it. I have tested dozens and dozens of differant types of cables and this has accurately identified good as well as faulty cables. As far as repairing cables I recommending checking the replacement jacks for faults. I recently repaired a guitar cable only to find out one of the jacks I installed had an internal short. Good tool for both professionals and amatuers.                
Wow what a life saver in the studio. I don't have to troubleshoot my whole studio when something is not sounding right just test a few cables and it's done. Very easy to read and with pink noise for a sound check. I will most likely buy a few more for travel or gigs.                
I have only had this thing a month now but I've used it to test every cable in the travel boxes of 2 bands and I've also used it to check my wiring in a 1-chance-to-do-it-right renovation project.The 3 x 3 continuity grid takes a moment to translate to a mental image of connectors and connections but the normal configurations quickly become familiar.Haven't tried the tone functions yet.Physically everything seems solid so far. I may buy a second one because it seems to be at the other site when I need it. Support not yet required.                
This is a great tool for tracking down problem cables. I showed it to our church audio guy and he's going to get one for the church.                
Excellent features for the price.  Unit seems well built.                
Easy to use... directions clear                
No more wondering if is the cord, or mic, or pickup. this one does it all.Great price and peace of mind. Every gigging band needs one.                
Ive been looking for a cable tester that the CT100 Has to offer. I will be addyng it to my set of important 'must have' pieces of test gear very soon.                
totaly useless, do not waste your money, you've been warned, unlike me.                
came with a piece of paper that didn't even explain anything                
it is in a metal case                
it is worhless, and useless                
i contacted them, they were no help, told me to tey a find a guitar technician, whom maybe able to explain how to operate it                
it looks good but does nothing                
i'm looking to buy a different brand                
I usually hate it when people write "I don't own this, but I've heard about it" reviews.  I just couldn't resist when I saw this.  I saw this thing immediately after looking at the Ebtech "Swizz Army Knife" and CRACKED UP!  They appear to be virtually identical in terms of features and exterior design.  This one's just silver instead of blue and costs less than one third as much.  I'm getting a pair of these before the lawsuit inevitably happens.                
Has similar features to higher-end testers costing 5 times as much! A little box that packs a HUGE punch. So many different test capabilities.                
Th UI takes some getting used to. Another review stated that he couldn't use the thing because there were no instructions. Well, if you are going to be using a more-complex tester like this one, then you should be technically inclined enough to work it as well. I don't want a newbie messing with my cables. Generally it tells you everything and more, but as with most testers you have to logically think about the lights and ensure that they are doind what you want. (ie. A correct XLR cable will have a up-to-the-right diagonal line of three lit LEDs. A correctly wired 1/4 phone TS cable will be a star (a number five on a dice)).                
Very good durable construction. I worry that the switches may break off when the tester is thrown around, but the tester is cheap enough to get another one if I can't fix it myself. The male XLR jack on my tester is a bit sticky, but my friends works just fine. This is not a problem just a minor nuisance.                
For $30?!?!?! This is absolutely the best deal you will find. If you have ever repairs cables before and only been able to test them through you board (yikes!) then this is a must! Plus for a nerdy technician you get a cool toy with blinky lights on it!                
So cool and so ridiculously useful. I have fixed around 15 cable and tested several dozen in the past month of ownership alone. A Super product.                
Like I've said; everything you could want and MORE! For only $30!!                
no sound                
Everything but a speaker and voltage checker.  There is nothing made that does what this does AND has those features.                
If you can't figure out how this works you should give up now.                
tbd                
na                
As a tech I don't care about cosmetics but this is small enough to add to my belt.                
I can't imagine what the heck happened with these others who have rated this item, maybe they got a lemon.  I live in land 'o gear, Los Angeles.  I'm a musician first and a tech second but I'm a world travelling pro in both.  I work in all kinds of situations from the studio to the stage to the field and REQUIRE reliability.  Hands down the most money (and the most pressure) is in television.  Me and my tech pals are hired because of our troubleshooting capability.  On one show I do, it would cost the network $300,000 per minute if we go down. With that much riding on the gig we are provided with the tools and the time to get it right.  Most TV techs use a Q-box which costs three times what the CT-100 does and has half the functions. This particular unit will take the place of three other testers I have and one or two that aren't even made. As soon as this arrived I started pulling out boxes of cables and right away found problems that I never would have detected so quickly or accurately.  The only thing it lacks is a speaker but, take it from one who knows, even for twice the ducats this unit is well worth the investment.                
I have been a touring guitarist so I have heard many PA setups. This box does the job nearly as well as other more expensive brands. Behringer cuts corners to deliver on the price (so do ALL of the other popular brands of gear thats how they make a profit) and while that may not be acceptable for some applications, it is fine to start out this way.                
The crossover and the input/output settings are the most used features by me and the delay/timing feature is not used because I do not need it.                
The learning curve for a virgin is a painful, tedious, frustrating one, but you MUST learn the fundamentals of using EQ, crossover and dynamic controls one day so you might as well jump in, I did. I admit there was some gnashing of teeth and cursing at first, but (thanks to Behringer customer service and QSC customer service -GX5 is what I use for my top cabinets-, I have finally grasped what it does and what I can and cannot expect to get out of the device. Like I said I am still learning, but in the past month I have been cramming like I haven't done since midterms and finals in college and it has paid off!                
It is made well. It looks hard as steel in the rack and I think it is made out of steel or at least aluminum. You would never want to drop a rack case, but if you did (god forbid) this thing would stand just as good a chance of survival as the high end expensive gear would.                
Yes. It costs a couple hundred less than the DBX box with similar specs.                
Yeah I was. I have heard that it varies, but the guy I talked to really knew his stuff. Reminded me of another gear company with top notch customer service. The CSR at QSC had to call me back after doing some research, but the Behringer guy had the answers in his head (even questions about non Behringer gear)! He helped me set up my PA for the first time.                
It is in a dark rack behind the stage I don't know if anyone is paying attention to whats in there except for other sound people.                
This box made my life easier just as it should have. I don't want to go back to life without a loudspeaker management system. From FOH Behringer mixer to Behringer EQs one to mains one to monitors, then to a Behringer effects processor for the mains before going to the stage rack in back. Then, on to this box (which handles peak limiting/gate, crossover, EQ and compression when needed). The DCX is makes 3 stereo pairs of the outputs (outut 1- left sub, output 2- left mid, output 3- left high, output 4- right sub, output 5- right mid, output 6- right high) the default setup with appropriate settings and crossovers out the box. Changes are not hard at all even from the little screen on front. After the DCX a Behringer compressor, 8 channel DI box and a sonic maximizer are available, but not used for the main signal nor the monitors. I am a beginner at this, so I have no other speaker managment systems to compare this to. However, I do feel that this product and the entire line of Behringer processing gear in the same line, make a great starting point for a new sound guy. With the price I was able to fully equip my PA and as I learn and grow I can imagine I will then have a better basis to choose if the more expensive brands offer enough ROI overall.                
We are using the DCX2496 in an installed system at Church.  We have several sets of speakers at different distances from the front of the church so each needs a different delay, and each needs a different cross over frequency.  This fits the bill perfectly.  Clean sound and relatively easy to set up.  And it is the most flexible box on the market.  The user manual was a little confusing because it highlighted the automatic self determining delay feature.  Once I contacted Behringer and received a simple instruction for manually setting everything, setup went quick and easy.  The price is expensive for Behringer, but half the price of a Drive Rack which can not do what I needed.
Being able to adjust the gain of each output was a nice feature.  It allowed me to match all the speaker volumes from the same piece of equipment.  The "Sum" intermediate channel turned out to also be a useful feature in that it allowed me to adjust the volume of several sets of speakers with one adjustment.  The average user will not need this, but it is available and very handy.                
The manual portion of user interface is set up more for a technician than a "player".  As an engineer I felt very comfortable with it.  It is intuitive so I can go back any time and re-adjust things without consulting the documentation.  Can't speak to the ease of using the automatic setup features.
The product is solid and does not generate a lot of heat.  So I expect it to last 10+ years.  Since it is all digital, there are not a lot of knobs and sliders to fail, and what you hear today should be what you hear years from now.                  
If you need the features of this product it is well worth the price.  And it has the ability to be configured to just about any situation now and in the future.                 
We have over a dozen Behringer boxes in our audio systems.  Their relatively low price has allowed us to spread our limited budget.  The equipment's quality and reliability are about medium.  The one time I emailed Behringer with a question, I got an immediate and thorough response.  Very professional.  
Huh?  This is a piece of rack equipment.  I don't care what it looks like!  I'd rather the money goes into reliability, not appearance.                
This should outlast everything in the audio system.  Don't have any plans to replace it or to get a backup.                
Hi I have not listened to the DXC2496 yet, but I have measured its performance. The unit performs miraculously. according to my measurements.
The unit will be used to TriAmp my K2 Klipschorns. That is going to be long project. Probably months.                
No Accessories                
A little hard to use, you have to be technically oriented, which I am.                
I found two problems so far. The linear regulator ICs run quite hot, I added a couple of heat spreaders to lower the case temperature of the regulators.
The second problem is that the RS232 port is not wired according to the RS232 specifications. The unit does not use the connector pin ground for signal return but rather the connector shell This I have not fixed yet.                
Yes it is worth it's price, It would have cost me a lot more to design it myself if I ever could.                
Got firmware upgrade from Behringer Website. It is difficult to find this unit on the website. The connection through ZZound, however did work.                
Technically this is a marvel, but not designed for the less technically skilled person. It is hard to follow the manual, and the operation is not intuitive.                
When I get it all to work like it should it will be used untouched for many years, bu this is a research project.                
Fast shipping with a great price on this DCX2496.
Very flexible controls to modify or experminent with different frequency/slope/delay settings for your speakers.                
I do not own studio monitors and as an MP3 DJ sound quality isnt on the top of my list. No sound creeping into the next channel as I was warned about from others. 24khz digital sound quiality so its gotta sound good. PS: not an severe audiophile but wont accept anything under 320 kbps for mp3.                
EFFECTS EFFECTS EFFECTS! When I started DJying I relied heavily on effect, the two processors they throw in are awesome. Lots to play with and many parameters to tweak to customize our sound. Kill switches are awesome! Havent used the sampler too much. I gave this an eight mainly because i felt they could have done just a tad better on the quality of the effects, the pitcher mainly.                
This was my first DJ mixer ever, EVER! Got it last year for xmas and haven't stopped using it since. READ YOUR MANUAL! This is the biggest thing, you opbvilously can figure out wat the faders and eq knobs do because its common sense, defiantly an awesome mixer to grow with, you learn something new everyday.                
This is my biggest gripe but you get what you pay for. The system feels cheap, the knobs are plastic, the faders don't have alot of resistance so to me it didnt feel solid like a PIO. Never the less that shouldnt stray you away from this thing, it is a beast. The layout is intuitive and well thought out. I actually had a DELL desktop fall on top of the mixer due to car whiplash and it survived only with a bent pan knob, other than that everything else was fine, can't say the same for my numark cd players. I have been beating this thing up for a year and I play with it at least everyday for 1 or more hours so I have but alot of stress on this machine, when things started acting wonky (midi stopped working, eq kills were not as responsive) support was simple (please read below)                
I would recommend this product to any dj at any skill level. it has all the features you can ever want and then some. 400 bucks for an awesome mixer, awesome support and an awesome experience. Even if you already own one and need a back up consider this thing.                
IF I CAN GIVE THESE POEPLE AN 11 I WOULD! Behringer support was easy, simple, and freindly, and the folks at zzounds.com were awesome too. zzounds allows you to download a copy of your receipt in pdf format. when you go to your support center at behringer.com you can fill out the form attach the pdf and ship it out when you get your RA number. The prossess was simple. On top of that I had a gig coming up, I informed behringer that i needed it for my gig on the fifth, they got it to me by the 3rd, three day turn around once my product made it to the warehouse.                 
Not extremely sexy in my opinion but the layout is clean the flashing buttons are perdy and all black makes it look professional. I use this with a macbook and they go hand in hand looks wise.                
if i had the money I would obviously buy something with alot more knobs and faders like an Allen & Heath, but this thing i would defianlty buy another one in a heart beat.                 
I have had this mixer for @ 2 years now.  I have never had a sound issue with it.  No audio bleeds etc. The thing I have had problems with is LED's going out on it.  I have multiple non-lit buttons.  Reading on the internet, I have not seen this issue.  Seeming Isolated I will replace it soon with my 3 year warranty I purchased with it.  I think it is more aimed at the home DJ for the chance to be able to express, but I also believe if a PRO were to use it for a while they would drop the stereotype!  On that note, proper use, and knowledge of this mixer will actually give you lots more features than most of the big high dollar mixers!Just because you use Pioneer, don't make you Tiesto!!  Keep Spinning!                  
I've owned this mixer for over 4 years and made over 100 mixes... You can't find another mixer with this many features...even if you spend $2000. I price is incredible where I was able to purchase 2, just to have a spare. And after 4 years my new spare is still in the box, because my original is still going strong. I would recommend this mixer from the pros to the beginner. My only warning is that you will need to spend a couple of days to learn all the features...because there are so many.                
It's like the Zone 92 and the P 900 combined.  I like the fact that I have two separate FX Channels.                
This item had tremendous promise. It has the features of a much more expensive mixer. It, feature for feature, is comparable to a the pioneer DJM-850 which costs four times as much; however, my unit was defective. After about two weeks of use, the mixer would emit a loud pop, and would no longer separate channels or control volume; everything was passing through at full volume. The cross fader wasn't working nor the up faders. The first time this happened, it was the night before a performance. I didn't think anything of it, so I restarted he mixer and kept practicing. The next day, the day of the performance, the mixer malfunctioned in the aforementioned way three times during a two hour set. It was alarming to me and the attendees, and it marred the event. Needless to say, I was really unhappy. But, the guys at zzounds.com accepted my return, and I am now the owner of a fine Pioneer DJM-700.This unit is probably not for professional gigs. It will work for the bedroom DJ whilst getting his/her skills ready, but is not reliable enough nor does it possess the sound quality for use in front of any sized crowd.                
Bought it 14days after it was released in my country. Believe me, the sound of this product is outstanding, it's digital!. Much headroom.                 
It have all the many features a professional dj or club needed. I'll give it a 9, because of lack of a compressor/ limiter on the output of the chanels. This features is included in the mic function. The ultramizer is excellent.                
Easy to use. If you can read, you can cook.                
Here we comes to a small shortcoming. The internal and  sound of this unit is outstanding, but the faders/ pots knobs, and the pots are made from a light plastic. The faders are all optical, which make it noise free. This unit is the perfect one for the road also, because it's light in weight.                
This unit is the price worth. Look what cost a Pioneer DJM800. Almost 3 times more. It's not worth it.                
Not on the moment. The unit is with me for 1 day. Til now, no problems.                 
I'm happy til now. Will see what it can do on the road. I'll take my Yamaha 01V96/2 with me, incase?                
I think this was the last buy for me. This unit looks like if it can live for a decade or 2. The price was best. I think it will increase later. It features everything I'll needed.                   
It's a Masterpiece.                
I'll give it a 9 earlier, because of lack of limiter/ compressor. You don't need it. The Ultramizer function included in the effects does it.                
As I say, If you can read, you cook !                
For such a low price the quality is outstanding. Some hardware  components as pots is of good quality plastic. Not need to be of metal. Don't worry about this. I'm in the electrical business, so I know it.                
You cannot get a professional digital mixer for this price. It have optical faders, so no noise, and a digital LCD display.                
I'll tested this baby for 24hours now. It rocks!!. So.. dont't need support on the moment.                 
I want no other mixer for Professional DJ work. It's a Masterpiece. You keep it til you die.                
I't Rocks!!. Still 24hours nonstop. Love it. Sound/ effects/ faders..                  
the actual sound is ok, not bad but not really good,
there is a huge problem with this mixer,
it does not have a volume control for the microphones, so when u turn on the microphone and there is a song playing, the microphone is so loud, and u r not able to control it by itself, u r able to control the entire main output,
BIG PROBLEM - I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MIXER TO ANY DJ!
ALSO,
I've tried contacting behringer for this problem, 
they have never responsed back,
i sent multiple emails and never got an answer.                
doesnt worth it, simple as that...

The sound of this machine is best suited for long, ambient pads and massive unison saws. The effects are stunning and bring out the true character of this synth. The amount of control you have over each effects parameters let's you fine tune this machine in infinite ways.                
This synth has the standard synth fare, yet with a few add-ons that pack that extra "oomph" The oscillator section is fairly limited. Osc 1 has sawtooth and square wave options, with pitch and pulse width control. Osc 2 is square wave only, but has extra control over tone, level and pitch. The filter has a couple tricks up its sleeve. The main VCF is switchable between 2 & 4 pole low pass. Control over cutoff and resonance is pretty smooth. Not much "stepping" and is quite colorful to the sound. Then there's also a high pass filter with a unique boost function. This is great for coloring your sound with dual filters without losing valuable low end. There's 3 ADSR envelopes, VCA, VCF, and assignable, all having control over the curve of the envelope. There's a dedicated slider and menu for VCA settings, as well as the in-depth poly/unison options. The arpeggiator is quite flexible, and even allows user patterns. The sequencer is a little different than a usual enter notes and playback type. You essentially set the steps in the menu then assign the parameters the steps are effecting in the mod matrix. This allows quite deep, rhythmic control of portions of the sound. Almost like having a 3rd LFO at your disposal with programmable shape. Speaking of LFO's, there's 2 LFO's with 7 waveforms each to choose from. Each LFO has a dedicated rate and delay slider. Last on the panel is the chord and poly chord options. Chord allows you to record chords for easy 1-note triggering. Poly chord allows you to record different chord variations and assign them to individual keys. Massively deep. The effects section adds a plethora of high quality effects to your sound creation pallet. Superior reverbs, deep delays, distortion, flangers... You name it, it's there. The mod matrix allows you to assign 8 source and destinations, adding much more control over sound creation, right down to modulating small details of effects.The back panel offers balanced audio outs, midi in, out and thru, pedal inputs, headphone, and USB. Menu options allow you to access midi options for both USB and WiFi. A nice quality keyboard, pitch/mod wheels, portamento and volume knob and octave control round out this fantastic machine.                
This synth is easy enough to use for beginners yet skilled synthesists will be amazed what this machine has up its sleeve. For those looking for a jumpstart, there's a ton of preset patterns to build off of and learn from.                
The Deepmind feels very solid. Solid metal chassis with nice wooden end cheeks. Sliders are somewhat wobbly, but they're sliders. Keybed is top quality. Pitch and mod wheels feel somewhat cheap and plasticy, but they do the trick.                
The Deepmind 12 simply blows away other synths at this price point. 12 voice poly analog at an entry level price. This is certainly hard to beat.                
I haven't dealt with Behringer tech support. But they offer a generous 3 year warranty, which shows they're committed to their machine.                
The wow factor simply comes from how much power you get from Behringer's first attempt in the synth world. There's a lot of people out there that like to bash Behringer for the quality of goods. This is just not the case here. Sure, the oscillators do lack in many ways, but I feel Behringer was incredibly smart in adding in "work-arounds" to those shortcomings to build a unique and cost efficient synth. I'm constantly impressed with the amount of sound and control you have here. Behringer created a winner.                
I'm sure that this synth will continue to surprise me for years to come. Behringer were incredibly smart about creating an incredible sounding synth while keeping costs down for the consumer. Impressive sound, build quality, & playability in a wallet-friendly modern classic.                
I put off purchasing this synth because I under estimated it. I thought this would be another one of Behringers attempts at trying to make a quality piece of equipment but this isn't the same old Behringer. The Deepmind despite it's low price tag is an extremely powerful synthesizer. I don't know of any other hardware synth that can mimic the sounds of a JX3P, Juno 106, Jupiter 8, Prophet 5 and Oberheim OB6 and a tone of other sounds in between. I can't even look at my Rev 2 the same anymore. I'm completely intrigued by this keyboard and just how much Behringer stuffed into it. Unless you're a professional or well adapted to programing synthesizers it's going to take a while before you can every say you mastered the deepmind. The abilities to make patches with the synth is incredible. It truly can be made to sound like synthesizers 3 - 6 times it's price range. The sound of the filters isn't cheap sounding but instead very rich sounding. I've been making patches left an right on my other synths but with the deepmind it really does take some time to learn because as it implies it's a deep synth. I only wish that it came with a tutorial video.                
It's no secret this synth is modeled on the classic Juno synth, similar DCOs with limited waveforms, however the 8 modulation slots and three envelopes make this a powerful synth that is a blast to program.  The limited waveforms are less of a drawback than it  might seem, as it gives the instrument it's own character.  Personally I am not crazy about most of the effects, but the routing options, including bypassing them, and the ability to control them with the modulation sources makes them a nice addition.  The fan is noisy, but you can turn down the speed to acceptable levels.  The keyboard isn't good, but it isn't awful, and considering the price, it is a non-issue.  The unit does not have a printed manual and you will have to download the Deep Mind 12 PDF as there are a lot of features that are not located where you expect them to be.  It is a great synthesizer and the price is not an indication of it's quality.                
I heald off on buying for several months. I read every single review I could find. I saw all of the horror stories. I read all of the Behringer hater, posts. Finally I ordered the Deepmind 6. All I can say is WOW! THIS THING SOUNDS AMAZING! I learned the mod matrix, edit functions & effects menues. This thing is deep & diverse. Nice warm analog tones. Good keybed. Nice control surface. Built like a tank. Behringer claims that the Deepminds are the most sophisticated synthesizers ever built. I believe it. I have this synth producing sounds like several old school much more expensive keyboards. My only gripes are that most of the presets are aweful. Way to much effects & unusable but with some tweaking, they can be improved. Some of them are set to trigger as soon as the patch is selected. They have the LFO singing on its own. Easy enough to stop in the mod matrix. Several of the presets are duplicated throughout the 8 banks of 128 presets. Other than those issues, which do not reflect machine but rather the abilities of the patch (or inabilities) of the preset creators. Bottpm line is I LOVE THIS SYNTH. Best buy I have done in 2018. Glad I finally pulled the trigger.                
This thing is sonically amazing...rich,full,deep,low,and gritty.I love it                
Although there are some things to like about this board, I can't recommend it. And will probably return it.
First, the sounds: Yes, there are many "interesting" sounds, which may be quite useful for sound effects, incidental music, etc. But out of more than 1,000 sounds, there are only a handful that are "musical" or sounds that I can place in the context of "songs." That's not much of a recommendation.
Thankfully, the editing possibilities are extensive, making for at least the Possibility of creating good sounds.
Then there's the unit itself. I'm surprised no one has mentioned that it has a NOISY FAN! Maybe Behringer fell asleep in the 1990s. We don't have noisy fans anymore, certainly not in music gear that requires us to listen to the SOUNDS. What were they thinking? This alone is a deal-breaker for me. I'm surrounded by keyboards, and the only one I hear growling at me is this thing. It's gotta go.                
From the compressor to the expander and all the eq possibilities available, my tone went from"eh not bad, I can deal" to "it's tight and punchy and no fizzy hissy blah, I love it!"                
Best features have to be the parametric eq and the compressor, those shaped my tone to get the perfect punch to cut through the mix for home recording ideas and practice and gigs. Least useful (for me anyway) are the feedback destroyer and stereo widener because the feedback destroyer eats some of my tone and I don't need the stereo widener for a mono setup                
It takes a lot of trial and error to get the sweet spot but that's with any setup and it's really your own personal preference. You'll be bouncing back and forth a lot to get what you want but the time spent is well worth it.                
Quality is fantastic! Behringer gets a lot of flack for shoddy products, but this device works wonders and it is an excellent addition to my rig, they did excellent!                
This eq is $300, I was wanting an axefx which is $3000. Just do that simple math right there.                
I haven't had any issues and figured the device out on my own, so I can't really say anything about support.                
Every guitarist that's a finicky with their tone as I am, needs one of these in their rig. I could never find the exact tone I wanted with the equalizations available on the pod alone. This fixed everything.                
Wow! That's all I can say! I added this to my rig to go with my line 6 pod HD pro x, and holy bologna it is a game changer. Using it as a dual mono setup with the left channel as a pre-eq and the right channel as a post-eq out into a carvin ts100 tube power amp and i have achieved tone nirvana! If you're going to use it in a stereo setup, I'd recommend positioning it after your fx processor or in the effects loop of your amp head.                
Already had one Behringer DEQ2496 Ultra Curve Pro purchased for $360 in 2005, got the second for another location--for only $299!-Thanks zZounds.com.                
I use these not for live music, but instead to equalize high-end music theaters.                
Learning curve is a good day the first time, you MUST RTFM, but once you have a basic understanding, it is very intuitive to use without a manual.                
Don't know how Behringer does so much for so little money. Lots of horror stories all over the 'net but I've been happy since 2005, no failures.                
Nothing to compare with, this unit takes the place of at least five individual and totally different units.                
Never had to contact.                
Behringer better not stop making it!                
10+ for the digital domain, no noise! 
Since I'm using it in a dedicated listening room, I'm a little more critical of the final sound and the onboard DAC isn't the best money can buy, but is more than adquate for the $300 pricetag. You can bypass it using the digital outs if a more refined DAC is available.                
Unfreakin' believable that they can cram so much processing into 1RU. PEQ, DEQ, DYN, LIM, fully controllable Image Enhancer, MIDI control, AES/EBU in/out, Optical in/out.... seriously, this is one of the last honest-to-God-bargains out there.
I would like to see it support the Width processing whilst in dual-mono mode, but at $300, I can afford a 2nd one just for that function.                
You don't learn how to fly a fighter jet after reading a manual. You have to get in a USE it, experiment, A/B compare, etc. This is no different. The layout is rather intuitive (I have no problems with it), but it's a complex device. The multi-function jogs are very helpful, but the lack of backlighted button text makes finding the right hotkeys a little tough in darker situations.                 
No problems. Worked out of the box. Fit'n'finish is good. I'd expect to get at least 10+ years out of my home use (after that, I'll shoot myself if digital controllers are where they are today). I don't have any concerns about the quality of this product.                 
I couldn't find anything close to this price that allows me to autoeq my room.                 
The best support is the support you don't need.                 
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.                
Since I can bypass the onboard DAC and select my own, I plan on using this for quite sometime. I'm extremely satified with the product so far.                
I find that this doesn't seem to color the sound in any significant, meaningful way. I'm not pushing complex musical program material through, mainly speech.                
More features than you can shake a stick at. To have this kind of functionality for the price is just unbelievable. It's clear to me that Behringer doesn't believe in disabling features that are already on a chip just so they can have several product lines.                
It took me a LONG time to really learn how to use the RTA and feedback destroyer/parametric EQ functions. I thought the manual wasn't particularly clear. It could have explained things in a more clear step-by-step procedure related to a real-world example.                
This unit started failing right after the warranty expired. There would be occasional static in the right channel. I eventually took the cover off and started poking stuff, and discovered that there's a ribbon cable joining two circuit boards. One end of this cable connects to a header, and simply disconnecting and reconnecting this cable a few times to wipe the contacts cured the problem for a while. I've heard of other manufacturers having similar problems with ribbon cables.                
I think that this product provides incredible value: all the features you need for a main house processor in one package at an incredibly low price. If you're willing to take the risk of failure (and now that you know how to fix it), it's a good addition to your audio system.                
I've had this unit for about 3 years. In spite of its problems, I still have it in my rack and still use it reguarly. I don't anticipate it failing any time soon, but should that happen I'd probably go with a DBX DriveRack PA.                
Simply outstanding no problem after  using over a year no overheating  Sound coming out  crispy end colorful  Thank You Behringer                   
I bought this one to do some room eq due to some nasty peaks on some frequencies. After a while I've decided to use it's DAC rather than the one of my amplifier (Denon 1804). Great for room equalization.                
I cannot use all of them... But there is one I would like to have:
It should downmix DTS and DD5.1 to two channels over the digital input or an option to bypass digital streams it doesn't understand directly to the digital output. What it does is that it mutes it on those situations and the RTA just gets crazy!                
Looks great. Own it for 12 months and no problem so far. I wish that they sold the equipment with the option not to mount on a rack. I use these machine for my hi-fi listning at home.                
For the room problems that I had before, the sound I have now and the cost...                
You should put an option not to rate this. I've no experience so I give it half.                
I already have it. I've even thought of buying two more to equalize my center channel, surround and subwoofer for 5.1 SACD and DVD-Audio. But by now I will stick to 2-channel for music.                
I will keep this until it burns out! Just kidding.                
Sounds neutral.                
This thing actually does more than the manual lets on.  You've got to play with it.                
No complaints - nice display - looks cool in the rack.                
You can't find anything out there that will do what this does for $300.                
Haven't needed any on any Behringer product.                
Great EQ/RTA - you've got to use it to understand it fully.  It will work as a stand alone RTA but the manual does not talk about it.  You can turn on the pink noise manually in the "I/O" section.                
I thought I had a VU meter problem. Emailed Behringer support, and they pointed me in the right direction. Just needed more drive to meet the VU input spec.                
The sexiest to a audiophile                
I bought 4 of them for my soundco.  Use them for FOH and monitor duties and they do a great job for me.  I originally bought 'B' stock units and two of them had display issues and were promptly swapped out for me.  One other had developed 'popcorn' noise after a couple months, but all were taken care of by Zzounds or later by Behringer.  Essentially, I got brand new units back and have had zero problems past that.                
The PEQ's do a great job of notching out feedback frequencies (never use the feedback exterminator-I'll find it myself just as easily) or  and room echoes (large hall corporate A/V presentations).  The delay features are terrific for multidelay lines for the corporate work.                
It can do some amazing things, but you have to LOOK for some of them.  The manuals don't explain some of the more hidden features like overall EQ gain or cut and delay resolution.  I found them accidently while working with them.  You can actually get delay resolution down to 1.4" when dialing it in.                
It seems to be a pretty good product overall, but their return policies should at least PROCESS the returned units so B-Stock doesn't get 'recycled' without thorough testing and remediation at the factory.                
Does one helluva lot for the $.                
Excellent!  Got a real live person right away, explained the issues and got an RMA within 3 hours via email.                
Outside of the Behringer 'stigma' that the sound snobs seem to perpetuate, I like it and I'd buy them again if I needed them.                
I'll replace them                
My DEQ is a RAM-modified (Reflection Audio Mods, in California) unit that cost $725 US and is used as a DSP-powered DAC in a 2-channel, low-end, Hi-Fi.  I've never heard this machine in stock form, but, read debates online as to whether or not it had stock high-frequency problems, so I played it safe. After break-in, I was extremely pleased.  Compared to my $200 Onkyo Changer (now the transport), the soundstaging is much improved 'cause of 3 things: A) the image was far better separated from the speakers than ever before - most welcome - B) the DAC's response alone, below 30hz or so, while lacking in the Onkyo, was completely restored, and, in combination with C) the extras, like the sheer flexability of the digital parametric EQ and the digital stereo width control, make for the most solid and widest soundstaging (and the most control) I've ever had.  The digital glare seems gone altogether and I can enjoy playing the system louder now(!).  Plus the digital expander works very well, too - not a hint of clipping or "breathing", also called "pumping", as with analog desingns.                
A tremendous amount of features.                
I thought this unit would be harder to get used to than it was.  Rather logical and intuitive, once you get the hang of it.  The manual gets you pointed in the right direction, but, doesn't go far enough into the details of "when" and "why" you use it - only "how", mostly.                
Mine has been without problems since I got it in February, '07, it's now June, '07.  Well, just one problem. When new, out of the box, my DEQ blew it's 1-amp fuse every time I turned it off(!).  I was told I could substitute a 2-amp fuse without harm.  Since then it has been fine, but, it remains a curiousity, to me, all the same. I suppose this machine to be reliable, but, I've read some comments about aggregious failures.  My firmware version is 2.1 and I can only wonder if Behringer has been working on reliability issues, all along, ever since version 1.2 - I dunno, but, here's hoping.                
This RAM-modified version has transformed my system.  My speakers are three-way towers with twin 8" woofer per side, but, moreover, they're sealed-box designs (26-28k)+or- 3db. That means I can EQ them without the usual problems with boosting response with vented designs (below the 3db-down point), such as drastically increased driver distortion and audible port noise.  My point is this, the very good response of my speakers to start with, together with the precision afforded by such a great DIGITAL, parametric EQ, means, in my case, I no longer have to consider buying a good, powered subwoofer(!) - probably saving myself about $1,200.  A Swiss-Army kife, when it comes to DSP, and a great-sounding, RAM-modified DAC section.  For $725?? Are you kidding me?  I'll take it!                  
Have not had to use it, yet, but, from what I gather, it's fine if you want to ask a question, but, if your equipment needs repair...                
One of the most desirable feature sets for Hi-Fi.                
In absolute terms, the RAM-modified version's sound quality is very, very good - awesome features.                
the sound quality is pristine. i use it for live recordings and mastering.  great space saver. does the work of many other brands you have to purchase individually. if you know how to master, this is all that you need.                
for live pa, with speakers spaced apart, the time delay is a great feature to align speaker outputs, witht the stereo imaging feature, you can get creative and aim your sound at different target points in the audience, more eq's than you can handle, great digital out which offers ultra clean recordings and compatibility                
solid, well made, we shall see if it stands the test of time, in the studio and on the road                
have not had any problems, own other behringer products, no problems                
Very clean.  I often have to use one or both of the pad buttons if the signal is too hot, but it doesn't affect the sound quality.                
I was looking for a DI and I got a much more versatile device than I expected.  Two -20dB pads, balanced or unbalanced input, balanced out. Ground lift button to separate the internal grounds in case of noise.  It runs on phantom power, too, so you don't have to keep changing batteries.                
The unit is VERY easy to use -- plug and play.  The battery box was designed by someone with more patience than I have.                
I suspect you could drive over this thing.  I've dropped cases on it and it still works great. Very well made.                
You could get a passive DI for less, but the amp in this is very good and the control it gives you is amazing. I'll never buy another passive DI.                
It's got an industrial-looking ruggedness about it and it is very good at what it does.  Pretty desirable, I'd say.                
If someone lifted this from a gig, I'd waste no time replacing it.  It's great! I can't imagine it failing because it's built so well, so I imagine I'll have it for a long time.  I might have to give it a name ;o)                
It cleans up noise efficiently                
the pads are a lifesaver                
Replacing the battery sucks                
I got 4 for this price everything into the mixer is balanced                
haven't needed any                
this is a great Behringer product. Scary isn't it!                
VERY GOOD - if it works with your PA then the sound is good. Be aware that when you first plug it in, sometimes it gives off a MASSIVE SURGE through the board producing very intense feed back! This is one of the bad things about it.                 
It has 2 atenuators which are great. As stated, above watch out when plugging in!!! THIS IS IMPORTANT. The atenuators work well to cut down the hotness, but make sure and tell your board man power off your channel and bring it up gradually. If the sound is weak, PULL SLIDER ON BOARD TO OFF POSITION, and then click one of your artenuators off.. do them one at a time or you could destroy your PA speakers. This is the only 1 problem with this unit but it is a big one!! Take heed or pay the price!!!                 
Self explanitory. it has many inputs types to accomodate many applications.                 
I bought it  because it is built like a tank... One big improvement they could make is that the hole to install battery is very tight and small, and the wires going to the 9 V connector to your battery  are  very chintsy and over delicate. They should make them at least 2 inches longer, but again the cavity that the battery fits into is very tight and may not accomodate the extra length. This makes it a real pain in the butt when installing the battery. You have to be especially careful not to break the delicate wires.. But for $35 bucks.. what can I say more...                  
For the $$$$ you pay it meets all expectations                 
I have always found their support to be good, never used them on this product though... too simple no need.                 
The appeal is great, but again, it has its problems. It offers many different solutions 1/4 input, or xlr, 2 atenuator switches, a ground lift that really works, but has to bad features which destroys its integrity.. One is listed above - massive power to the PA .. follow my instructions above and you will be ok. Second -- I have found that on certain PA SYSTEMS --- THE UNIT DOES NOT FUNCTION. I never figured out why. Maybe Support may have answers. But I tried everything from switching cords, XLR to 1/4, atenuators, ground lifts... if it don't work, you're screwed.                 
I had this unit for 2 years and it has served well. but as I say, sometimes it is contrary with certain boards and just won't function. If you buy this, plan on re-investing in a back up for this reason.                 
I've been using these things for years and have given several away. At this price point it is worth sharing the wealth. The active circuitry is impressive and sounds better to me than passive DIs. The phantom power option is also great and saves on batteries. The only drawback is the small 9 volt battery compartment, but I don't foresee changing it that often. This is a great DI for a great price! The thing is built like a tank. I haven't had to use the manufacturer support so I didn't rate that one.                
I am running a Korg Krone at my church and for the life of me could not get rid of the annoying buzz that followed once I turned keyboard on. I have used several passive direct boxes and have had little luck. However, when I tried this active direct box, I was blown away by the silence. Even at high volumes, lowest of lows and highs of highs, I experience not added sound just that of the keyboards voices. Amazing product!                
I'd say the sound quality is neutral or clean pass through in a live situation.                
Most useful is the flexiiblity of this device. This is used in live open mic setups where there is a constant stream of change.  One guitarist has a battery preamp, the next has only a peizo pickup, then one who has a DI output but it's 1/4",  then another instrument with an XLR out.  This box handles them all, easily.                
Plug in, adjust gain on instrument, adjust gain on mixer, then play.                
Rugged.                
It's a bargain! You could spend a lot more, but in a live sound it won't sound any better.                
Never a problem with these.                
It's heavy, so it stays put. Has a light so you know it's on. Stackable.                
Love these. With this you can connect anything to your live sound system.                
Simple machine. I run an acoustic guitar through it and use 10db attenuation and the sound is very clean                
I have used this direct box in a couple of different studios in the city that I live in.  I remember first thinking, "Great...  ...a Behringer direct box?!?!" when I first saw it.  Behringer isn't exactly known for quality...  Anyway, hooked up, played, and was VERY please with the tone!  The tone was clean with little (if any) noise.                
Well, it has features that a good DI should have...  :)                
Plug in instrument, plug in XLR, play.                
I have been impressed with this product when I have used it.                
After having played through this DI, I would have expected it to be much more expensive!  Very good deal!                
n/a                
I don't really want it because I have a passive DI box that is still working, and I usually run directly into ProTools when recording sessions anyway.  The few studios in the area that still use analog mixing consoles have their own DI's, and I just use them.                
This is an excellent product at an excellent price.  Having recorded at premier studios such as The Process and Underground Sound Recording Studio, if this item is good enough for them to use, I know that it is good enough for anyone else.  If you are looking for a DI, this is an excellent buy.                
Puts back that which was missing...for the price...come on excellent.                
The phantom power supply is very nice to have....clean.                
This was made for the busy musician,no doubt.                
Very good product                
Not yet ,but who knows                
We were getting distortion when using with a bass off of a bass effects processor.  Also distorted with digital V-drums.  Distortion is worst if the pads are used.  We went to a cheap passive box and the problem was fixed.                
Tends to hum and hiss when pushed.  Tolerable for live situations, but not that useful in the studio.                
No jack for ac adapter.  Phantom power is a life saver, though.                
Pretty easy to use.  One thing is not made clear - is the mic cord input balanced or unbalanced?  It says both in different places.                
On the surface, it seems to be very well made.  The internal parts have come loose a few times, causing its ultimate demise.                
A good, inexpensive di box.  Don't expect Pro quality or reliability.                
Never dealt with them.                
Rather have something that's reliable.                
Already looking for something with xlr input, phantom power, ac adapter jack.  Something more professional with less of a noise floor.                
Plug it in, push a button, play.                
Has worked well for a few months.  Let's see how it does for a year or two!                
Works well.  Does exactly what a DI should, nothing more and nothing less!                
Previously I said something about the thing not being able to get rid of static coming from my computer CRT monitor. I was an idiot. 
DI box has nothing to do with that function. (Turn the monitor off or point your guitar to a different direction)
And a comment about the LINK sounding better than the OUTPUT. I was an idiot again. Get a XLR to 1/4 in. if you want to connect this to an effector with only 1/4 in. output. 
The thing works very well.
And for what it costs, no one can complain.
I use this for my guitar recording, and this is the first machine that the guitar MUST go through!                
This is a wonderful piece of equipment.  I have run my bass as well as my acoustic guitar through it, and they both sound great!  Behringer has done a great job on this one, especially with the price!  I would recommend it to anyone.                
Sound quality is basically OK. However, it is much noiser than the DI100. This isn't a problem for guitar-level sounds, but for quieter signals can be a significant problem.                
The different configurations make this unit flexible. You can use it as two separate DI channels or you can use a single in routed to two outs. Being able to utilize phantom power rather than battery is a plus.                
The noise floor is too high for my application.                
Very good price. This would be a perfect unit if the noise level was as good as the DI100.                
Behringer responded very promptly to my email requests.                
it's justa practical addition to my setup.                
Didn't make much difference to my signal from my efx processor, other than attenuate about 10db and taking away a little mid freqs.                
Supposedly quite handy with the dual independant channesl and link options.                
Sorry, Behringer, but u call this a rugged sturdy product? It is extremely filmsy, doesn't even have rubber stoppers under it. It'll go flying if u kicked it accidentally. Mine had 2 extra screw holes left empty under it. Plus the battery compartment is retarded.                
Cheap, but doesn't do much either. I returned it after 2 days and got a GI100 instead. That's a much better product.                
Never dealt with em, but good site.                
No use for me.                
Took me 5 mins before I decided to move on to another product.                
My experience with the DI-400p reveals it is not ideal as a guitar splitter/d.i. for splitting a guitar to 2 amps or recording interface and an amp, or 2 interfaces. There is an extreme signal loss at the xlr output, when you hook up a second output cable. Suddenly there is barely any output at all.  What is really needed is an active D.I. box which can boost the signal back to zero loss, such as the Ultra-G. Unfortunately I already threw out the box and receipt, so it can't be returned.
Not sure what instrument this could work with, maybe a keyboard? If you only need the one output and have only one cable plugged in it works alright.
The positives: It's well built, heavy duty, simple design, small size. Ground lift switch is very effective. 
Get an active D.I. like the Ultra-G if you want to split the signal.                
the box operates as it should, with a sold transmission of the bass signal to the sound board. the signal is clear, strong, and precise. no loss of strength or chance of tone.                
I got to say I like the sound but it's not that loud.                
It took me a minute to get it, the only thing I needed the manual for is the list of effects.                
I was about to get a vmx but I was told for a little bit more I could get this. Over the other mixers in this range I was surprised at the features.                
It is a great mixer when everything is working right, but i had a few problems with the unit i bought. After 3 gigs the bass stopped coming through on one of the channels and the microphone sounded very bad. The microphone was very high pitched and it sounded like a similar problem to channel 1 when the bass stopped going through. So i didn't plug my mic into this mixer. I just plugged it into my controller and it sounded MUCH better. It it weren't for these two issues i would have kept the mixer. I loved everything else about it.                
the worst mixer by this company ... poor sound quality ... faders is good but cross faders is leaking a lot ...sound is not at all expressive...no bad quality..not compactable with any style...poor sound... poor for both live  and recording...poor sound in different settings... pioneer players... poor low quality ... pl improve crossfaders and improve in master volume and improve on fx...                 
faders are smooth                
it is simple and easy mixer to use

pl dont buy this                 
bad support in India ... no support at all takes a lot of time ...                
bad mixer no appeal at all . too bad mixer for club live and recroding.....                
not satisfied with this product since i brought it  .... i will replace it as soon as possible. i will replace it with allan heath ...                
good but it is not very load                
has built in fx                
the person that I know had the same mixer for many years                
You will get a lot more than you payed for                
it looks good but I dislike the way the crossfader looks                 
The mixer in my opinion needs improvement on the efx panel not good or helpful selecting the efx and really just taking up space ,then the fader,line sliders are just too loose ,u only getting usb aside from that it's just not a stand out mixer for the cost,of $250! Now the ddm4000 for $350 is the pinnacle of a deal ,and the mixer can compete with the pioneer mixers that coast $1800 ,see that's my opinion,and zzounds.com is great with customers service and the Web site is also easy to use for purchasing and tracking etc!                
The spring reverb in my Carvin SX-100 Combo has a harmonic in it which is an octave above the note. As I'm an aging wanna-be Jazz Guitarist and,typically use no distortion most of the time, that harmonic became really annoying.The DR-600 was purchased basically to replace the Carvin Spring Reverb which this Behringer Reverb is doing admirably. It just set it on "Spring" and adjusted it a bit and it replicates a Fender-ish spring reverb sound. I run it on this setting 100% as I would with the mechanical reverb unit and really can't tell the difference. The glissando slides on my Flatwounds are spectacular through the DR-600.This turned out to be a really good purchase.                
The range of features on this pedal is generous, particularly considering the price!  Lots of 'verbs to choose from, and all of them are useful.                
This pedal is incredibly simple to use[I didn't even crack open the manual!].  Turn the dial to the reverb style of your choice, and set the tone/level as desired.                  
This pedal is made of plastic.  That being said, it is sturdy enough to have on stage and not worry.  This is my second Behringer pedal, and if you take care of it it will take care of you!                
This pedal is an honest-to-goodness steal.  Awesome reverb sounds, for a small price.                
I've not dealt with the company, because I've had no issues.                
This is just a practical addition to my setup.  The reverb on a backup amp broke and instead of fixing it, I bought this.  I figured this way, I could use this reverb in many different applications[in my electric rig, for acoustic gigs, recording etc.]                
This product has surpassed my expectations.  It does what I need it to do, plus a whole lot more.  And, it was easy on my wallet!                
My new amp has an effects loop but no reverb. Using this pedal the problem is solved very nicely. Playing with the settings provides some interesting choices in reverbs and if one really wants to you can create some very nice soundscapes. For me though, I basically set and forget it, getting a very nice clean bit of verb to give the guitar some depth. And the price? Fantastic!                
The reverb on my Peavey Classic 30 is noisy as mot of them are.  I bought this pedal to replace that reverb sound I need on many classic rock instrumentals. The various sounds you can achieve with this pedal is amazing for it's low price.                 
The product provides 4 dials..that's quite a few for an inexpensive pedal. The dials allow you to get a great number of different reverb sounds. Also it's easy to get at and change the battery.                
This pedal is very easy to use. Just plug it into your effects loop and go.                
For the price of this product, I think the quality is fine. It's a plastic case, but if taken care of, I'm sure it will last a long time.                 
Great value for the money.  I needed a usable pedal and this really fit the bill.                
Haven't used it as yet. Product worked as advertised.                
I don't think any of my pedals has real sex appeal.  This one fits in fine and looks good in the loop.                
Very satisfied with the price, value and usability of this pedal.                
This pedal is an obvious homage to it's Boss counterpart but that's OK cause it works great sounds fantastic and has all the same features. The difference being that this pedal is housed in plastic, that being said is not to say it's going to come apart on you. Its thick plastic, the only weak link is the pedal switch the hinge is weak and the switch it activates is small and fragile. Not a problem for me I don't wail on my pedals just something to be aware of. But it's a great deal if you buy pedals for sound and they don't necessarily need to be built like a tank.                  
Almost all Beringer boxes are made of plastic and use the same basic shell. That is not a real issue cause they hold up pretty well. My main beef with this two fold. Least of which is the fact that when you turn on the power to your effects array, most Beringer boxes on automatically in the on position. Don't get that. Secondly and specifically to the reverb when adjusting the intensity of the reverb, the higher you turn it the more guitar attack you lose. By the time you turn it all the way, it's just an echo with barely any attack. I would never have use for that. Don't know who would.                
The first unit failed out of the box.  The blue "on" light is overpowering.  The battery access is a bad joke:  You pop a retractable pin out with a ballpoint pen.  It's hit or miss, and the pedal spring can go flying, as it's not attached!  This unit eats fresh batteries.  With a new Duracell, you get one hour.  Get the AC adapter.  So far, with the adapter, my second unit is hanging in there.  I put it face down, onstage, to keep myself from being blinded by the blue light.  On a positive note: The effects sound very good.                
The sound is amazing to me.. im running it through a Epiphone les paul custom and a crate halfstack.. it gives me the glowing push sound... and has beautiful angelic oohs and ahhhs sounding almost like a chorus when i run it with my soul vibe and original ibanez cs5 chorus                
i give it a nine because it doesnt have the surround reverb but i can put it through the gate channel and compress my sound with my digital pedal and nearly create the surround reverb im looking for...                 
very easy and very accurate i absolutely love experimenting with this pedal definately a cool pedal to have.                
not bad.. it isnt build like my soul vibe or my other metal plated pedals but it will be just fine i assume.                
to me its the absolute best bang for the buck as far reverb is concerned it will be at the front of my pedalboard for many yearsx to come.                
? i dont know a whole lot about behringer this is my first product from them but ill give them props for having such a affordable pedal and useful at the same time                
not the sexiest pedal i own but it does the trick with its sound                
ill hang on to this pedal as long as i live i dont believe in trashing something like this even if i find a better reverb pedal im 25 and kids these days dump out pedals because they have a better or newer one... one day down the road these era pedals will be worth something maybe even magical lol jk                
I bought this DJ mixer instead of a traditional mixer because it has many stereo inputs and PFL crossfade capabilities. Unlike a typical DJ set up, I use it with my synthesizers, laptop and drum machines. It's great to be able to cue up a synth patch or drum beat in a live sound situation and mix it in like a DJ would. It's a great mixer but I have 2 complaints: The construction and sound quality is not great, and the effects send and return is only for the first 2 channels. That makes no sense to me that you cannot add effects to every channel. If someone puts out a DJ mixer like this with effects on every channel I'll buy it!                
product is great and has a lot of options for me to use. it is very easy to use. also love zz sounds payment plans                
Noticeably noisier than my Mackie (with nothing plugged in).  But it's not really enough to make a difference when you're actually using it.                
It has everything you need for basic mixing.  The BPM counters are so slow and jumpy they're almost worthless, but then I don't like to depend on them, so that's not a problem for me.  Maybe balanced outs would be nice, but that's a minor detail.                
Only took a minute to figure out how to use everything.                
Hard to judge.  It doesn't "feel" sturdy, especially the crossfader.  But on the other hand I have not had any actual problems, so I can't really mark it down too much.                
Absolutely a bargain.  All I wanted was a 3-channel mixer with 3-band EQ kills and this was much cheaper than anything else.                
Never needed it                
Eh, it's like all of Behringer's stuff: it's not fancy or cool, but it does the job.                
If you want to do a lot of scratching, you might want to check out something sturdier.  But if you just want to do mixing and beat-matching, I highly recommend that you buy this one and save the money for records/CDs/MP3s.                
Works to my standards, which is just fine - the EQ is great (a little simple, but works perfectly.)                
Had just enough features for the price, great value - nothing shnazzy about it, but it gets the job done.                
Incredibly easy to use; a great and simple layout.                
I haven't had it very long, but I've used it heavily and it seems to be in great condition.                
Incredibly bang for the buck. Delivers everything you need for a simple rig at the right price.                
n/a                
It's pretty plain and practical, nothing flashy, but I don't particularily care about that.                
Great deal, great buy - Behringer did it well with this mixer.                
Did beat matching, long-mix style long time ago but still have all my vinyl. Decided to make a setup for some hobby playing. Ancient Numark mixer's fader was dying so need to get new mixer. Form factor mattered because it needed to fit in a custom case. Price not really an issue. Did bunch of research - then one day came across DX626 and just ordered it - at that price, if I don't like it, I can craiglist it or give it away.I'm mixing vinyl only, don't need effects, don't need a showpiece. Turns out - I like it a lot. Even hooked up 3rd turntable. BPM meter is useful - not for live playing - but for ppl who liked to write BPM on their record labels. High end models will have lower noise - but for practical purposes (not studio) don't think it will matter. Had to do a quick hack and removed some of the knobs - they still work but wont be tripped by accident.                
This mixer does exactly what I needed it to do. Great product and great price.

ITS THE 3-CHANNEL THAT DOES IT                
IF I WERE TO LOSE THIS ONE I WOULD REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER ONE                
I am just a recreational DJ so this is perfect for me.  The seperate Low, Mid, High are very distinctive and the volume control sounded really good whne pused to the limit.                  
The BPM counter looks good, but it is very slow.  Can be useful if playing each record one at a time and then writing down the BPM.  The extra channel is a huge plus.                
Took a little while to get used to the setup but everything is fine.                
It looks really good.  The knobs and switches slide very nicely.                
Perfect for the beginner or recreational user who doesnt want to spend a lot of money, but still wants quality.                
I havent needed to use this                
Looks high-tech.  No dazzling lights or state of art graphics, but I like it.                
I am very satisfied with this item.  I wish I would have known how slow the BPM counter was.  The third channel makes up for it though.                
The EQ's are a bit wonky.                
The mic input is non-standard, the bpm counters are pretty useless.  The three channels is a good idea.  No kill switches unfortunately.                
The cross-fader is absolute crap.  I didn't even use it for half a year before it gave out.  In general it feels pretty cheap and ready to break.  I had noise appear occasionaly when twisting the gain/eq knobs.  I didn't abuse it at all, I was pretty careful with it.                
It's very cheap but you get what you pay for.  This is about the only mixer in the price range with 3 channels but the bad crossfader is a deal-killer.                
I like the silver coloring but the plastic used for the knobs is a bit cheap and what's up with that crossfader for cue listening, why not use a knob?                
I would only consider it if you are really short on funds and need something now.  Wait a few months and save up for something that won't break so fast.  I wish it would have kill switches and the crossfader was more sturdy.  I wouldn't buy it again.                
I use an ECM8000 every weekend as an RTA mic to monitor the room from the FOH position. In addition to getting the frequency real time analysis I also get the SPL reading. This helps me put a set of eyes in conjunction with my ears of what's going on in the room and make the necessary adjustments to the "sound" of the room. I also use this mic as an ambient mic on stage for IEM's. Everyone can add as much "room" to their mix as they want. The flat response and omni direction pattern of this mic works perfect in this application. Based on how well this has performed for me in these applications and the price point - I typically recommend this mic for these apps. Oh yeah, I also use it in conjunction with various speaker management boxes.                
Good mic. I purchased this microphone for use with my desktop, MathAudio Auto EQ software and the Audiophile 2496 sound card for room correction. I am quite satisfied with the results. If you need a measurement mic on a budget, for the price, it's worth it.                
Even if this mic twice the money it is a bargain. Everyone needs some onmi mics in their mic kit, and these are tremendous. I have used a pair of these micing grand pianos and they are super. Depending upon how bright your piano is, a little less at 12-15K might be needed, but the naturalness of pianos comes shining through. I just finished a famale vocalist with piano accompiment and people and the customer were shocked at the results. If you know what you are doing Behringer makes achieving great sound wihtin the reach of anyone with a few bucks. Highly recommended.  At this price it is a no brainer.  Jim Tavegia atlantaaudiorecording.com                 
Great sound.                 
Small size makes it very unobtrusive.                
it is a bargain at this price.                
As an engineer it makes my job easy. Put it in place and hit record.                
I will always keep 4 of these in my mic kit.  I already owned three and this weill give me 4 to do any stereo project i want.                  
Pretty accurate despite the Behringer name. Close to an Earthworks at 1/6th the cost.                 
Calibration mic. No more. No less.                
Pretty good and rugged. Just put a piece of tape over the Behringer logo and you're good to go.                
For those looking for a cheap calibration mic without spending $2k, this is unbeatable.                
Good. No issues.                
If you need a calibration mic, it's awesome.
If you want to record with this microphone, you're a moron.                
Great for the money. Pretty close to Earthworks calibration mics that cost 6x as much.
Very useful if you want to tape down some measurement mics in the audience for a live show and don't want to cry if an audience member opts for a five finger discount on one.
It can't handle the max SPL of earthworks or other high end options, but for most people its range is more than enough.                
Excellent sound quality and produces great bass reflex. I use this for DJ and KJ purposes and it pushes quality sound to my two Peavey DJS4 speakers.                
Not many features for this unit, it's simply plug and play with twin output controls.                
Extremely easy to use, simply plug and play.                
I've had this unit for two years now with no issues. Unit appears to be well made, heavy and sturdy.                
Great value! No other manufacture comes close to producing such a high powered unit at such a low price.                
Haven't had to deal with the company on this product.                
Very sturdy unit, black in color and rack mountable.....as a DJ I can honestly say that when first installed and fired up it was a real turn on!                
I expect to keep this product as long as possible - if it fails, I'll replace it with the exact same model!                
I just got mine via fedex and was very impressed with how quik and accurate the delivery was. I am pushing an 8 ohm, 800 watt r.m.s., 15" Peavy Low Rider sub in a 6.5s.f.vented enclosure well insulated and etremely strong. At the dial set at half the amps power,. the speaker wants to break out of the enclosure. The bass power this beast puts out when in bridge mode is unlike anything I have listened to in that price range. I may have to purchase a Low Rider Max. I should have purchased the EP4000. This is not the amp for people with bad backs. It is very well built and weighs over 40 pounds.                
I bought my first two EP2000 units back in January of 2010... six years later .. still running as good as the first time. I am buying new ones now because I don't like to tempt fate, as backup amps now..I'll be surprised if I don't get another 5 years at least.                
This amp does pump out some Power to my 2 -- 18inch EV SUBS. After looking up the setting on the Internet for the switch mode on the rear of the amp . when I got the switch mode corrected for my setup , I am Very Very pleased. zZounds, thanks for being there!!!                
I just bought this amp and i put it to the test the following weekend Djing outdoors at a festival. I pushed my equipment to the limit without any problems at all. I spun records for 7 hours and played it loud and this amp paired with the EUROLIVE VP2520 speakers made me a believer in Behringer... Great Job!                
After purchasing an EP4000 from a friend, I chose the EP2000 to drive a pair of 8 ohm 400 watt Crates exclusively. It delivered. I've beat the EP4000 pretty hard doing outdoor shows without ANY problem... Heat. noise, clipping, or otherwise... For the price, I can easily compete with the bands that go deep in their pockets for comparable power. Though I have rated manufacturer support high without ever using it, I'm pretty sure with this distributor, I've found a winner.                
This amp kicks but!!! Swapped out my Crowns for these. At 2 ohms the Crowns would get hot. Not these EPs. They were cold to the touch. Fan is loud, but it keeps them cool, plus the amp racks are up stage and I am FOH, so I don't here them anyway.                
I am really pleased with the performance of this Behringer Amp!  I am powering two Carvin LSx2153's.  (The power rating of the LSx2153's is 800prog/1600peak - manual states 800cont/1600prog/3200peak)and the sound is really clean with the BEH EP 4000.  The cabinets are "true three way" series, and the EP 4000 does an excellent job.  I tested the unit at 40% with the clip limiter on, and the low cut filter on set at 30Hz.  The EP 4000 does exactly as it was designed to do!                
The "built in" accessories are the clip limiters, and the low cut filters.  They perform as expected.  Great job Behringer!                
The dip switch diagram is printed on the back panel of the EP 4000 for easy reference.  The manual included with the EP 4000 does an excellent job explaining the multiple scenarios of how to utilize the settings of the dip switches.  (I had this amp up and running within 30 minutes out of the box!)                
The quality is great!  The BEH EP4000 is built solid!  Cosmeticly, it has the design of any other professional amplifier.  One down side is that this unit is HEAVY! You definately are gonna want a rolling rack, or portable rack and have someone help share the load in weight, or safety purposes.  (It is not EXTREMELY heavy, but heavy enough to warrant proper handling...)                
The current price is set just right for the BEH EP 4000, in that if you are looking for an affordable AMP is plenty of power, you definately can not go wrong with the BEH EP 4000!  (just between you and I, I have it on good authority that a competitors AMP rated at 7000 watt - 3500 per channel peak [priced at $799] has not performed as anticipated.  This was shared with me by a fellow musician that purchased their unit new two weeks ago)                
I don't have a rating as far as "support" because the BEH EP 4000 perfomed great right out of the box.                
I own it, and highly recommend the Behringer EP 4000 for anyone looking for an affordable "beginner" amp.  Definately worth a try.  I'm glad I did.                
I have used other professional equipment, and in my opinion, the BEH EP 4000 is a great, afforable and alternative investment to the higher priced AMPs that we sometimes want right NOW but don't always have the funds for them.  I plan to add two more LSx2153's to complete an small system for smaller gigs, and DJ work.  I too was leary at first, but for the price, the BEH EP 4000 is a smart investment.                
i bought one of the ep4000 amps bout six years ago and the only problume ive had with it is some one left my systim on for two days and i had to let it cool off before it would come back on. the amp works fine and i have ran this at 2ohms with no problumes. some people say you get what you pay for but really how do you know your not getting rip from the big guys. Ive learn a lot in the passed seven years big names are not what they seem to be and I will be buying at least four more of these amps. Thanks Behringer for putting a true value on your products.                
Having no prior experience with power amps I followed a bunch of prior reviews on infinite baffle subs that led me to purchase this amp for my infinite baffle. And yes it will power four 18" drivers quite nicely and with little effort giving that clean undistorted bass that I've been looking for. The only experience I can compare that kind of bass to is sitting in a cathedral that has a large pipe organ and when played rattles the seat you are sitting in.                 
This amp is perfect, It has the extra power I need to push my speakers,It's twice the power of my old amp. Running them at the same volume(Used a sound meter to check level)the sound is so much cleaner when your amp is not at it's peak. Over all very happy with this product.                
Would have liked sub woofer crossover built in, But I do like the low end filters that are built in.                
turn it on and turn it up !                
Looks really solid,(Built like a MAC truck)Haven't had it long but it likes like it can take some abuse.                
Best bang for the Buck!!!!                
Haven't needed any customer service other then a few tech questions that they answered for me.                
It's a power amp, it's practical addition to my setup, but it does look good in my rack.                
Should last a very long time,I will probably, buy another one (or two)to replace other amps I have. The quality of construction and overall sound can't be beat it for price especially. (I can't believe they sell them at the prices they do) If it where lost or stolen I would replace it! Great addition to my sound system                
The sound of this amp is incredible. Now that Behringer is using Toshiba parts I'll bet this will stand the test of time. The manual and the amp itself is self explanatory. IF you don't carry around your manual the back of the amp tells you all the settings.                  
I'll reiterate one thing the previous reviewer said...This thing is HEAVY..IT will take 2 people to carry this thing especially in a rack unless your rack is on wheels. I'm a decently strong guy and I was surprised how heavy this thing is...It is built like a Tank though so it will be durable..                
Manual and the back of the amp are very explanatory. All the settings are shown on the back of the amp for reference.                
Much more durable than Crown and QSC IMO. And I have used or owned both...On the other hand I think Behringer likes to fudge a little on ratings and sometimes what they say the ratings for on their products are slightly lower.                
C'mon for the money you will be amazed at the quality and performance of this amp. I know most people snub Behringer products and in most cases rightfully so but they are moving in the right direction and you can't go wrong with this or any of their power amps.                
I don't know about the support I haven't had to use it.                
this thing is HEAVY.....not sexy at all....But the power is beyond Sexy...                
This is my only power amp now so I shouldn't have to buy another power unless this one dies. IT has more than enough power to need another amp.                
The sound is very good and I have a good ear for bass.                
It is plug in and play--XLR inputs and neutrik outputs, used in stereo mode. Real simple.                
I use a Behringer cross-over (good product) and adjust some of the sound levels with that. I use my mixer for other levels and finally a Peavey Kosmos for distinctive low end. The amp just reproduces what is sent to it and it does it well.                
It is built like a tank--steel box. So far, it seems to be very reliable.                
The old saying goes: you get what you pay for. I suppose I would have less worry about the amp failing if I spent $2000.00 on a QSC Power Light series amp. However, I was impressed with all of the positive reviews for the EP 4000. Time will tell.                
I have never dealt with Behringer directly.                
I like getting 4000 watts for $329,00.; This is wow enough for me.                
I had a Behringer EPX3000 running my Peavey 218 subs--was ok, except the finals blew out and the amp was not worth fixing. It is cheaper to just buy another power amplifier. I chose the EP4000 as I had read the glowing reviews on it. It is heavier, but with the transformer, I thought it would deliver a better sound. I was pleasantly surprised at the sound and headroom which is superior to the EPX 3000. For a dampening factor of only 300, it sounds much tighter and punchy than that. I expect it will serve well as the bass driver for my 3-way system.                
Just let it be                
None                
Very easy                
Little heavy but made well                
Very good price                
Not jet                
Its just fine                
I put the sound at a church festival for 2 days 10hrs @ day with the heat of 101 degrees in the I.E in Calif. Over 12 bands, mariachis and more. Im very happy we finish the job with honors.                
The amp sounds good.
Great sound quality, and a great amount of power.                
It is a bummer that the only outs are those newer twist type cables.
BUT, they are better quality in the end, although not every speaker has those connectors available.
But it shouldn't be an issue with any newer speakers.                
REALLY easy to use amp. Enough said.                
Great quality for what you pay.
Maybe not quite up there as 3,000$ QSC amps... But still unbelievable for the price... And who isn't on a budget these days?
This amp is the meaning of value.                
Never talked to them... Luckily never needed to.
I have owned this EP4000, and an EP2500 for a very long time, and never have I had a problem. No matter how hard I push it.                
Well... I have one, lol.
ALTHOUGH... I really want another one.                
Great amp, Great Price, Great quality, Great support and warranty, and I wouldn't have it any other way!                
These are some powerful amps I bought 2 of them and I use one on 4 15s and the other one for 2 18s. I normally use Peavy amps. What made me switch over is because I like Barringer crossover so I decided to try they amps I was very satisfied. I'm a Dj                
I'm amazed at the sheer power plain and simple. I have two Ep4000 running four 18" Sonic Subs with B&C 10000 watts RMS woofers and they do damage. I just provided the sound system this past Monday for the 2013 Barber Battle in Brooklyn, NY and the placed was moved. I was leary of pushing them but DJ Jazzy Joyce had all the power she needed and with and eye my trusting hand to check if they were hot. It not once displayed any rise in heat. I give it a 10 because if you study the specs it out performs most amps.                
 ok for those of you that are sceptics about behringer power amps here is a little something you should know. On the net there is a audio forum that did a test for many different brands of amps QSC,Crown, CREST and behringer etc... The guy who did the test was a repair Tech for Crown for many years. Behringer rated there amps under lab conditions ie room temp at x degress, air flow etc.. in the real world with the testing done. the output of the behringer amps were still very very compariable to others and in fact did BEAT out pwr and THD or some Crown and and Qsc amps.. search for the article. See the amp looks like copies of Qsc and others and if you open it up the guts and design is the same as QSC. All in all I personnal have serveral of these and in bridge mode they are at 2100 at 4 ohms THD is .2 % So NO you wont see the 3000 or 4000 watts clean as stated but still very very good power for about anything.. Dont be afraid of them.. thanks 
I bought one of these used for 150.00... WISH I could find another that cheap. A beast of an amp. Use care in speaker configurations! It doesn't overheat, the voice coils will... zZounds has the best price so far on NEW ones... I'll buy another for sure.                 
PURCHASED 2 EP4000 AMPS. SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH.I JUST DID SOUND FOR A FILIPINO FESTIVAL IN PASSAIC PARK NJ,9TH OF JUNE. USED THEM TO PUSH 2 BINS AND 2 FULLRANGE CABS..THESE AMPS REALLY KICKED.CLEAN SOUND.FOR THE MONEY, I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BUY!!!! I AM GETTING 2 MORE!!                
Had 2 liked them so much bought 2 more from here 2 days they were at my door I've used crowns and qsc and these are the best bang for the buck. I will be buying more when I start working on my monitor system.                
I give this amp a 10 as it delivers it's RMS rated power and does so cleanly and without distortion or added noise.  The headroom of the big Europower amps is amazing.                
Straight forward to hook up and use - no issues - comprehensive manual.                
For the price these CANNOT be beat - PERIOD.  I own two EP2500 and two EP4000 - they are very solid with zero quality control issues.                
Hands down best pro amp value avail.  Forget about the knock on Behringer making low grade stuff - this amp will hang with amps 4x the price easily.                
I recently purchased a Behringer EP4000 Power Amplifier to add it to my amp rack. I am using it to power my subs for plenty of overhead power. I have been using a QSC 1450 for my upper end and the Behringer EP2500 for the subs. I was so impressed with my EP2500 that I got the EP4000 for my subs and moved the EP2500 to my mids. Too Much Power for Clubs? not at all, just clean overhead power. It's great for my speakers, and our sound. AFBmusic.us                 
Who cares? It's a power amp.                
You can't possibly do better than this amp for even double the price.                 
It's a power amp...what features do I need? It has speakon and banana connectors, clip light...? What more?                
Plug and play                
Built as tough as nails...this thing is solid                
Can't do any better for the money                
Never needed it but I assume Behringer has great support so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt                
I want three more!!!                
I am a professional touring musician. This amp is exactly what it is supposed to be                
I have a Beringer 400 amp that Ive had now for about eight months I am very happy with the qaullity of this amp I have had no problume with this amp and my sound systum is awesome all to gether I run 9000 watts of power 4000 of this is my beringer I would recomend this amp to any one who is looking for a all around amp                
Amazing sound. I just compared this amp against the QSC4050HD and NO ONE could tell which amp was playing which speaker. I had these amps hooked up to 2 Cerwin Vega EL-36B subwoofers. Drove them at maximum power for about 8 hrs at a wedding I DJ'd. At the end of the night I asked my collegues how was the bass, they said awesome, pounding! No one could tell I used a Behringer! Sounds CLEAN, no distortion or loud noise.                
With all the features built in as the limiters and clip monitor, you can't ask for more unless you buy a new digital amp like a Crown with built in DSP. The inputs and outputs are all an industry standards with 1/4" to Speakon.                 
Plug it in and GO! Tweek it later.                
BUILT LIKE A TANK is TRUE! Heavy and could probably take a beating, but I will keep mine rack mounted.                
For $350, is that not the best per watt average you can find?                
Honestly never had to call. Their website is nice and easy to use! LoL!                
I already own this. If I needed more I would defeniatly buy moer!                
AMAZING! Overall cheap, powerful, and durable. It has clean sound and loaded with features amongst the industry standard connections.                 
I use this amp as a power amp in a home stereo system. It replaced a vintage Carver power amp and is absolutely fine. I haven't found the end of the power band yet and have played it really hard. I love it and believe that it is the best bargain going today.                
I matched the EP4000 with my Beyma 600w RMS speakers (Beyma 15G40 woofer + CP380m tweeter) and the sound is incredible. Crystal clear sound at very high power. The amp had more than enough power to work these big speakers. Anyone that claims the amp is short on power has not matched the input (mixer / graphic) correctly.                
The amp has various mode switches on the back, as well as an easy aid descriptor for each.                 
Plug in and play.                
Build solid, which makes it a bit heavy, but solid.                
I dont understand why people feel like they have to pay a lot for an amp to believe it is good. If Behringer doubled the price they may sell more.
The electronic components of all amps cost about the same, except the power supply components (Transformer and large capacitors). To get the real full power from an amp, you cannot skimp on this, which is why this amp is heavy.                  
Unknown - Has not broken down                
I have it.                
I previously owned another 2000w disco amp and this one is far better. They both pushed out about 550 w RMS at 8 ohm but this one does not battle and has many more features.                
This amp is so powerful, you can push it loud without driving it hot!!!                
this amplifier will replace high end amps.more than you'll expect...i own three                
The Sound Is Good Really Good For A 350.00 Amp It's Priced Cheap And I Own 2 And Plan On Owning 2 More Soon. Any One Want To Buy My 2 Peavey Gps 2600's Cost 1350.00 New That's How Much I Like The Behringer 4000 Willing To Sell 2 Peavey Amps That Cost 4 Times As Much In Place Of Them. Believe Me They Are Powerful And Good Enough Sounding. I Give Them A 7 In Sound                
They Are Versitable                 
Don't Know Hope There Easy To Deal With                
I got one of these amps use it to push 2 duo 18 cabs@60 % and have no trouble im getting one more two just be able to set one per side and not worry ..                
i just got this amp used it one time so far it cliped 1 time im useing it to push 2 double 18 cabs ev it was hot  in bluigd ,so far its good going to try try it on 1 doulbe 18 at 70% is if it works good alone on 1 cab,like i said it was hot in bluidg.i will buy 1 more for the price its great note if you put  a fan put it in front of amp..
It's true this is a very good amp for the money but if it by chance breaks you'll be waiting up to a year to get it back as there are no parts available in the USA and this goes for all of the Behringer products I hope they resolve this parts issue. I would have given it 4-5 stars for everything however the repair issue is big.                
We us this amp in our church and it works really great.                 
Um its a amp and it works good.                
plug-and-play. adjust the settings and your good to go                
its worth the price                
never needed it                
you have to have it but it does look sharp                
For a long time                
I purchased this amplifier from ZZounds and when I got it in, the amplifier was defective. I returned it and I was going to get a replacement,but I needed an amplifier for the following weekend and ZZounds was out of stock for this amplifier, so I requested a refund, and went bought my EP4000 locally. If ZZounds could have had an amplifier shipped to me before the following weekend, would I have purchased it thru ZZounds? Definitely. I really do appreciate the professionalism this company has presented to me. Would I ever deal with this company again? You betcha!  Thanks ZZounds!                
This amplifier features your on/off power switch, and your channel 1 and channel 2 volume control. Which work great, over all (aside of the defective one I had, but that's really not a big deal to me since I was able to find another one and it worked just fine.)                
This amplifier is totally easy to use. It literally tells you where everything goes in the back of the amplifier. You can't go wrong with this.                
Though this amplifier is quite heavy (coming in at an estimated 40lbs, more or less), it is built tough and is made of quality parts. The product is very reliable. This amplifier can definitely be used "on the road".. I do it. The worst aspect is that it's so heavy, so for those who can't lift heavy amplifiers, you might want to try something a little lighter, but if the heaviness doesn't bother you, by all means, get this amplifier. You won't be sorry.                
Yes                
I have dealt with Behringer. No, they aren't hard to reach if you call during their normal business hours. They are very friendly. Yes, they told me it was my amplifier that was defective. No, no experiences under warranty outside of this one. No, no repairs or upgrades.                 
This is just a practical addition to my setup.                
I've been satisfied with Behringer for many years. You can't beat their prices. I bought this product because it was affordable and it had a great reputation at the time of purchase and Behringer's reputation still stands firm and true. This amplifier helps me meet all my musical goals and needs. If this product were lost or stolen, I would replace this product with the same exact product. I love Behringer products that much!                 
Great power,sound, look. Heavy yes but what do you want, flimsy plastic crap?
The brackets for the rear are attached to the front brackets and are universal fit to accomodate many rack mounts, but you have to remove a few screws then remove one of the brackets {look close there are ywo on each side} and attach it to the rear bracket support, not very difficult at all. A previous reviewer returned a great amp because they couldn't figure this out. {???}                
Out standing for the money would rec amend.                  
What I like the most is the power for the dollar. What I like the least is the weight. But I guess that comes with the quality and the power, you cant have a top with out a bottom.                
It is pretty much self explanatory, even a monkey could use it.                 
As for the reliability I don't know I just started using it.                
This amp is the best price in its class.                
I have no need to at this time                
the mounting holes on the ep4000 don't match the holes on the gator rolling rack...you get only one screw on each side to hold the 48 lbs of amp.  scared me alittle so returned the amp.  didn't get a chance to power the amp so I can't give any reports on that end.  am looking to a peavey ipr 3000 which only weights 7 lbs with slightly less power 3000watts instead of the 4000 on the behringer. I owned a peavey 750 for along time and never had any problems.  I talked to behringer about making the mtn holes bigger and they told me that it would void my warranty...for correcting their mistake of not matching the holes in my gator case.   hope you have better luck than me.                
NONE.  it should have had mtn brackets for attaching the amp to the rear of the gator case but they had none.  if you get this amp I hope the two (2) 10-32 screws hold the amp in the case. You might want to hold the ends of the case just in case the amp breaks loose and falls out.  I called gator and they don't recommend using just two screws to hold that much weight.                 
???                
very heavey amp for more than one amp in a case.  hire stronger "roadies"  if you mount this amps with other amps.  very poor quality control on the mounting for a 2u space.  they (the behringer co.) may need to hire someone who could measure correctly. I use the 1u peavey and qsc 2u space amps and the mtn holes all match perfectly.                
great price for something that you may have to return                
very unfriendly.  when I asked about making the holes longer so I could mount the amp with four screws, the rep almost had a heart attack. and told me  if I touched the mtn I would void the warranty.  so he told me to return the amp to the dealer that they were working on that little problem... 
note: I hope that person that drills the holes bigger can measure better than their engineers did.                
sex appeal???  are you kidding, the holes didn't match lol                
less than a day.. who would steal something that wasn't made right????                
It is one of the best amp i have ever had! it is quick simply and to the point!                 
The features could've been beter but i like that it has a clip light and a sound light.                
It is awesome, i only had to read about the switches on the back and that was it.                
it was made very well and it can take a hit.                
Yes it is the best amp i have ever owned!!!!!                
the product is so good that i didnt even need to contact the company!!!                
It isnt the best looking thing unless you like just flat black and white for the logos.                
i will always be satisfied with this amp and if i ever need another one i know where to get it and it will always be Beriger                
using this amp for 4 kustom 10" monitors. 4 chanels, 4 seperate volumes. plenty loud for hearing yourself behind your mains. clean and clear sound. no distortion                
I do open mic in a local bar and just run vocals and an occasional acoustic guitar through it and it does awesome. Never had to push it to the red to achieve the right sound. I even did a show with a full band with it. The reverb sounds great and its easy to haul.                
Great for small rooms, very reliable. We use primarily to DJ a weekly gig at 600 sq ft bar. We can fit this PA, stands,  add'l loudspeaker (connected to MON out for sound reinforcement) three record crates, decks, mixer, lighting and folding 8' table all in mid-size car. Used a few times for live bands, worked well but again had to use one of the monitor outputs to reinforce sound on low end. Used for about 100 performances so far, no issues. good at what it does.                
I was a little apprehensive about the size of the speakers ( 8" ), but when they came and I got them out of the box. Let's say I was impressed with the look of right off, and the sound is great so far. I haven't gotten a chance to even hear half of their capabilities so I'm looking forward to turning them up!!!!!                
I have a ministry of gospel music. This is my first sound system. Every church or nursing home the system has no trouble with volume. Sounds great. I purchased two speaker stands, mic stands, and extra xlr cable with shur mic. For what I paid and what I got (I couldn't be happier)                
I play drums and percussion in a small start up band. No one had a PA so I bought the EPS500MP3. It was very convenient to be able to pay over time....$100 up front, $100 next 3 months. I ended paying it off the next month but nice to have the option. Thanks ZZounds! Besides practice, we've used the PA 2 times. One inside gig for about 50 people and one outside party for about 30 people. I'm happy with it's performance on both occasions. We ran the keyboard and the rhythm guitar and 1 vocal mic through it. All sounded good. I was a little skeptical when I first tried it out in a living room for practice....didn't seem like it would be powerful enough. But both gigs, inside and out, we had plenty of power/sound. We are a pretty low key band though. Good fit and finish too.                
This is the smartest system i have bought. Its so convenient for small  parties. 
I use by itself or hook it up with the bigger system i bought and it fills all the needs i will ever come across. Its also the smartest self powered system i have.   Hook a lap top up and start DJing.                
The tonal varieties are non-ending when you have such control over all the frequencies.  If used in your effects loop (if your amp has one), the difference is phenomenol!!!!  You can use it as a boost, but then when you turn it off the original amp sound is a bummer.  What happens is you end up leaving it on all the time.  A friend has a 10 Watt, 8" acoustic amp (total crap) and this pedal made it sound bearable.                  
Turn your ears on, slide the levers up and down until it sounds right.    Any EQ pedal will do this but for the price this is top notch.  It's made to emulate the Boss GE7 (?), and they are completely comparable.                
The pedal is inexpensive to buy because it's inexpensive to make.  Plastic casing, plastic controls, dust can just get right in there...but for the price, what the heck do you expect?                
Can't do any better for the price...trust me....I tried!                
Never had to deal with them.                
It may not be the prettiest, but it gets the job done..and did I mention...it sounds great.                
I'll use it 'til it dies, or runs away. At that point I'd re-buy the exact same thing.                
I use it LIVE And to RECORD. Can't beat it for the PRICE. NOT crazy   about the color but HEY, it sounds great.                
NO problems; it works.                
Sound and Quality make-up for the color.Easy to use,And priced to sell                
It is a keeper,expect to have it a long time.                
Just like any other eq., you have to play withit for a while to get it right.                
This is the second one that I have owmed. After a year, sowmeone stole the first one. But for that year I had no problems with it.                
The cheapest one on the market anywhere.                
I'll probably go through everal of these over the next 5 years simply becvaus I'm that rugh n epuiment. But I'll always come back to Behringer because their eq's are second to none. love that German engineering!                
I'll repeat what other Behringer users already know. Behringer makes quality "tributes" of well known effects pedals and offers them at reasonable prices. The EQ700 is comparable to equalizers costing several times as much. It makes my amps and guitars sound great, offers infinite tonal ranges, is quiet (no unexpected hiss), and reliable. The case is ABS plastic, but so is your car bumper - the case does not easily crack or chip and will look good long after metal cases have deteriorated. I gig with Behringer pedals with no issues. Get a power adapter (they quickly consume batteries) and you're good to go.                
handles all my standard efx pedals even my volume pedal. The price is right. I had the canvas/material efx pedal bags but they did not protect my pedals. So, the hard shell is the perfect fix. Came with power and connections cables.                
7 band EQ settings really allow u to customize your tone.  9v Battery is nice.                
Pretty good.                
Cheapest EQ pedal there is.                
Doesn't look that amazing, but I still want it.                
Great pedal.  I like the tone it can make when I play slap bass.  I raise the Low's and High's and keep the mid's where they are.  This really lets you hear the plucks and slaps!                
it could just be my recording progam, or maybe my audio interface, but i experienced- not the most, but not the least- a bit of ugly feedback. made my peavey mystic sound like a gibson digital though.                
as of its cost versus how up to par it is with other pedals of the same features, it greatly nerfs them. there's still that slight ugly feedback though.                
simple yet versatile. perfect in a way.                
as opposed to cost, like i said, its one of the best on the market.                
definitely a deal.                
i haven't needed to talk to them. eh.                
it just looks standard, almost protocol.                
i'll be sure to keep it for quite sometime. great on a budget!                
Clean, undistorted sound. Each of the sliders has an easily audible effect, as it should. In comparison on a Daphon EQ pedal I have the sliders have only a small effect and to have an audible effect I have to slide them all the way.                
I like to be able to use an EQ on bass guitar too, where I attenuate 100 Hz and boost 200 Hz and 400 Hz sliders, then attenuate higher sliders. You can't do that with this equalizer. On the other hand I like to attenuate at about 6 kHz and above while not attenuating below about 4 kHz and this EQ allows this.  The materials and parts are poor quality, mine broke in transit to the first gig I took it to, and I did not handle it roughly. 
So, lack of durability was a big problem for me. I opened up the nonfunctioning unit but could not find any loose wires or broken connections, every thing looked right.                
The sliders slide too easily. With minor jostling I end up with tones I did not expect or want. The battery compartment is ridiculously difficult to access. It is hidden in the rocking part of the pedal.                
It broke and I couldn't fix it. It fails the gig test. It's fragile. The too-easily-slid sliders also make it unworthy for gigs.                
If you need an EQ you will not transport, fine. If you will gig with it you need to get something more durable.                
I didn't deal with the company.                
It's so plastic I always thought it was a marvel to work so well. But no, I give it no sex appeal, status, aesthetics, or affection. Now that it broke it's like an ex-wife.                
I bought a Daphon EQ. The price is about the same, it's metal and doesn't feel fragile, and the sliders aren't too slidy, but the sliders have a much much smaller effect.                
I bought two of these, and they both have the same problemsThey cause the high end to get a dissonant ringy wobble, they cut signal quality while on and this causes a major loss in sustain.I bought this knowing the quality on the outside was on extreme budget side. But they are unusable to me, so I will return them and buy something higher quality.                
This is basically a good-sounding unit.  I have my complaints about it, but they are tolerable.  One is that this thing can be very noisey.  ...But it can also be whisper quiet.  I'm not 100% on why, but I moved this pedal from my main board to my auxiliary board, and it has be nearly silent.  Other complaint is that some of the eq positions are not as useable.  The bass switch, for example, seems to cause a lot of noise when boosted.  You have to leave it under midway, or the hiss will floor you.  The boost slider, as well, needs to be within certain parameters to avoid hiss.  Also, you really have to play with this to get it to sound good.  For example, you can't just decide "I want a midrange boost," set the thing to a frown, and expect to get what you want.  I will sound quite bad, you will end up playing with switches randomly to get a good sound.  My midrange boost only sounds good with bass furthest down, a hump in the mid, and a boost to treble.  It works though.  Great midrange boost sound, but you have to fiddle a lot to get there.                
This has all the features I could ask for.                
Because of having to fiddle with setting to get what you want and to eliminate noise, I give this a 7 for ease of use.  You will have to fight this pedal a little bit to get what you want.  It will yield it to you if you are careful and not overly picky.                
Behringer quality, plastic parts, crappy batttery location, rubber that can peel off.  Just not pro stuff, but still very serviceable.                
Behringer value.  That is to say you are always going to get more than your money's worth with this pedal.                
Didn't Use.                
Behringer desireability.  It's utilitarian.  You buy it for how it work and how it sounds.  It does not look cool or impress anyone.                
This is a great unit.  I'd like to give it a 9, but I just struggled too much with noise and controls that are a little obtuse.  This thing does not suck tone though, and it will let you have a very nice eq boost on your board.  I love using it for quite pickups when I change the selector.  I like to use it as a boost for a loud rythm passage.  I like to use it as a mid-range hump boost period.  It's excellent for that.                
The first thing any guitarist should get after their first guitar and first amplifier is their first equalizer pedal (put it right after the guitar in your signal chain).. Even a novice will be able to shape beginner equipment into clear, well-defined, and possibly even legendary sounds with a few minutes of tweaking. You'll end up leaving this pedal on all the time. Even if you think you don't need the tone-shaping abilities, this is probably still the cheapest boost pedal around.Don't let the price fool you, this will do pretty much the exact same job as pedals going for four times as much. Behringer may be affordable, but they're not cheap in my experience.Unlike most pedals, it's important to note that there is no room for batteries - you must have a 9V power source to use this pedal. (Or I'm extremely oblivious, I took this fella's shell apart to see what makes it tick.) I do want to note that my particular pedal has a low-volume hiss, which I've found very noticeable on high gain settings and the high sweep on my wah pedal - although I also have unresolved grounding issues in my apartment that may be exacerbating this. The slider knobs also feel a bit fragile and pop off relatively easily, but you can still move the sliders without them. Not a big deal on either count.Bottom line, get an equalizer pedal - this is the most affordable option by far, and it'll get the job done satisfactorily. In fact, get two or three to throw in your signal chain, especially if you use other effects, it's really nice to be able to shape pre- and post- distortion among other things.                
THIS UNIT IS VERY NOISEY AND VERY CHEAP!!! THE EQ SLIDERS ETC REALLY DO NOT DO MUCH EQUING, IF YOU ARE NEED A EQ PDEAL LIKE THE OLD SAYING GOES YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR THIS THING IS TOTAL JUNK!!! NOISEY JUNK.                
I had to knock this one down.  This is the noisiest hissiest pedal I have ever owned.  I can't believe I am not seeing anyone else have that problem.  I might have bought a lemon.  The eq is fine.  You can make a decent mid scoop on this with a stomp and/or use the db to boost or attenuate your signal.  Great if you are footswitching from a clean to a metal tone.                
This has pretty much everything an eq should.                
Cakewalk.                
This is plastic and rubber, but it is durable plastic and rubber.  It will not break, but isn't quite a metal pedal either.  The switches/sliders are very cheap but are completely manageable.  Overall, this pedal is extremely useable and functional.                
Okay, you cannot buy a cheaper pedal than this.  The fact that everything works like it is supposed to and doesn't break make it an unbeatable value.                
Don't know.                
Not a desireable pedal by any means.  It's purely utilitarian.  If you want it, you want it because it is a serviceable eq and for no other reason.                
I'm am happy with my pedal purchase.  It does everything I expect it to except that it has an unbearable hiss.  I might have gotten a lemon, but instead of buying another eq, I am buying an NR to eliminate hiss.  I would recommend this pedal to anyone who needs an eq but wants to save a dime.  The only reason to climb the price ladder would be for a sturdier metal pedal, switches/sliders that feel smoother and heavier and well built, and less hiss and noise.  I can't guarantee that a Boss eq would solve all that, but if those things are important to you, it might be better to start there.                
The sound is great, I loop it through my amp, gives me the sound I'm looking for.                
Standard features for EQ                
Very easy to use                
Made out of plastic, but it seems sturdy.                 
It was cheap and it works great.                
Asked their tech support a question about power adapter, they got back to me within a day.                
Great EQ and the price is right. N                
This easily compares to the Boss EQ, or other common names in terms of sound. You could a/b them and be hard pressed to find much of a difference besides the obvious visual aspect.                
Despite the plastic casing, I havent had any problems with this unit so far. The plastic casing doesnt sound very promising to say the least, but It would be fairly tough to really destroy it. The bottom is a metal siding with thick rubber to keep it in place, but the rest is a plastic case. It is thick, so unless you drop gear often or put them to the test of the road, it should hold up.                
For this low price, I don't see how it could be a bad deal in any way. Unless you recieved a broken pedal, I wouldnt be complaining, especially with the sound quality of this pedal.                
To sum things up, for the price it is unbeatable. Just as good as a Boss eq, but in a yellow plastic disguise.                
Hi, I received my long awaited back-order yesterday (two F1220D's) with great anticipation. First noticed these speakers are much smaller than expected. (About half the size of a "regular" stage monitor.) Open the box, hooked-em up and played with them for awhile.   They have some great features that I like. (Bi-amp, dual input with separate level controls) They hit "clip" fairly easily but have a pretty decent sound overall, But then I decided to hook up one of my Behringer F-1320's inline next to these. The one F-1320 dwarfed two of these in size and sound. Just drowned them completely out. So if you need BIG sound these F1220D's are probably NOT for you.                 
I bought a few of these for band monitors for our singers.  I especially liked the feedback filter feature due to all the problems we usually have because of it.  In an effort to simplify the process i got these.  They seem to be well made, and as a previous owner of ev powered speakers I can honestly say that the name brand doesn't necessarily mean anything.  Behringer is truly a big bang for the buck and I recommend their speakers to anyone that dj's or does band gigs....and likes their money more than a high price name brand.  Well with about the same results and in most cases BETTER....you cant go wrong.  The only thing that I didn't really care for about these particular speakers is that they don't seem to like bass at all.....so if your looking for solid vocal or keyboard monitor this is for you. As it stands, it suits our needs. You cant use this as a drum monitor in other words.  As a future further improvement it would be eventually nice to see a built in two line mini mixer to adjust instrument sounds on a separate channel as the vocal....this of course is easily fixed by buying one of the little Behringer line mixers for about 20 bucks....so not really an issue.  I will write another review once these have been tested in real time.  We have used these for practices and they perform as expected.                
You'll have a wide range of sound parameters including the Anti-Feed Back option as a stand alone system. You can jump/patch the Monitors together. The power of the F1320D is enough to deafen you.                
Rugged construction. All mixer setting knobs are recessed for protection. Metal front screen in a convex form will protect the 12" speaker from damage. Exterior covering and corner protectors are well made. Anti-Feed Back is effective.                
Plug&Play as normal equipment. They are no disappointments just options.All connectors are top quality.                
 All connectors are good quality except for the AC switch. The AC switch is plastic and is not recessed like the mixer knobs on the front panel. That is the ONLY thing I would recommend improving. Like other reviewers, who commented on the F1320D lacking low end, I agree however this is a floor monitor. Keep that in mind.                
Behringer designers and engineers have produced very high quality products at a reasonable price. I feel I made the right choice, in the price range I needed. I don't have a grand to drop on a sub-woofer for example. I need the sound, not the Name Plate. It was gratifying to discover Behringer and become a very happy customer.                
No comments. Haven't had the need yet. (That's a plus.) This is a professional company. I feel confident that any manufacturer who makes top quality products like this will back them up with service.                 
WOW factor for me is very high.                
You can not find a better value for your money that Behringer products. This monitor is rugged and has all the features you want for a floor monitor. You will be very satisfied you selected a Behringer product, and like me, you'll want to purchase more Behinger products.                
For the price , this Monitor has a lot to offer, Plenty of power, Clean Crisp Highs, Tight punchy lows and smooth warm Mids, The 3 band EQ gives you all of this. Controls are easy to get to. Unless you have a sound person on stage, they can't hear what you need. This really works well as far as volume, clarity and feedback control                
I bought one of these these to try. Wasn't expecting it to be all that great. Used it at our  gig the next weekend and was very impressed. Ordered another one Monday morning.                 
The band had about had its fill of repairing monitor amps that didn't hold up, so I purchased a couple of these Behringer F1320Ds.  The sound is full and amazing!  I already knew that Behringer equipment was better than many thought, but we are really impressed with the sound of these.  Our vocals are tighter now, because we can actually hear ourselves!  We tested them in practice by using them as our PA (instead of using the mains) and they really were impressive.                
I purchased this monitor so that the led singer in our band could hear herself over the loud percussion section. It really did the job for the money. One of my best purchases. I highly recommend it.                
Rugged construction, great sound.  It took a little bit of tweaking to suppress feedback (there's a button for it) while using condenser microphones, but this'll be a great asset going forward.                
Simple, rugged, powerful. Amazing. I use 2 for band monitors. No feedback anymore. Loud! 300 watts x2 is a lot. Great response in each frequency.                
Product is top quality! Service A1 as always. Item arrives well packed and in excellent shape as always! You can't go wrong with this company or their products!                
What a AWSOME machine. Added to my studio rack and it cuts out the low noise in the background. You get a great recording with this machine.                
Iv tried other EQs and this is the best Recording/Mixing /DJ/Live/Studio/Home Or Club.THE FBQ is the Difference Maker along with Separate Bass control for your SUBs and HD ..And the price is Right.                
The unit does what is claims to do... eliminate feedback and allow the audio to be virtually untouched or colored in any way.  I am very pleased with the unit once set up.                 
Why a rating of only 5?  Because the newer unit OS ver 1.1 purchased in May 2009 does not set up per the operating manual (operating manual ver1.0 written in 2005).  I own two of these units, the older unit OS ver1.0 purchased in 2006 sets up as advertised but this unit DOES NOT!  You MUST initially put the unit in PEQ mode (parametric eq) and use the fly set up control wheel and set the mumber of parametric filters to some value (I chose zero) and then you can set the number of single shot filters and the balance of the remaining filters will function automatically.  THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED SOMEWHERE!!!  After you do this initially it does not need to be repeated because the unit recalls all of the previous settings once the unit is powered down and it works GREAT!  
No problems here, the older unit has worked flawlessly for me now for 3 1/2 years.  We play gigs 2-4 per month, we are pleased with how well the unit has performed once in operation.                  
Nobody can tough Behringer for price+performance.                 
I have had one experience with the Behringer company and they were very helpful.  
Zzounds has been wonderful to deal with as I have exchanged products with them and they have been very professional with me.                
Well built and performs as advertised... but Behringer needs a new technical writer on staff                
I have this unit connected to all of our vocal mics routed thru a sub-group and it is noiseless.  Even when running all 20 filters on a channel the overall impact it has on the sound is negligible.                
The FBQ elimination features are nice and easy to manage.  The use of this unit as a parametric EQ is just plain silly, however, due to reasons listed in "ease of use" below.  Learn mode and autolearn mode are horrendously hard on your speakers because they have to really be ringing for the system to tag it as feedback and suppress it.  I had to wear earplugs the first time I let the system learn by itself as it was screaming before suppression kicked in.  The use of the panic button in learn mode does prevent this from  happening.  Recommended procedure for shooting a room is listed below.                
As a feedback eliminator, this unit is easy to use.  The manual is dense, but easy to understand IF you study it for a few days while the product is in the mail.  The manual is rather deceptive in that it makes you think the unit will automatically nuke feedback within 0.2 seconds.  Wrong.  It takes much longer to learn or autolearn feedback frequencies and will blow out your eardrums or your speakers first.  Here's what I have found works best: Setting the system to learn mode and then slowly increasing the gain on the entire system to deliberately induce feedback while pressing the panic button repeatedly.  This helps the system detect feedback more quickly and will save your ears and your speakers.  Once all 20 filters are full, back the gain off and you now have instant headroom.  Now as a parametric EQ, navigation is so clumsy and difficult you'd be better just spending $100 on a 15-band standalone eq.                
The product looks nice.  The brushed aluminum is gorgeous.  I gave it a 9 and not a 10 because the knob on the front isn't perfectly round and feels and looks cheap when it's wobbling around as you turn it.  Other than that, it is well made.                
Feedback suppression for $150........you can't really go wrong here.  Once you've figured the darn thing out it really does it's job well.  I was able to DOUBLE the volume of our practices in a small room with this unit because of the feedback frequencies it was supressing.                
Can't rate this one; haven't needed support.                
It has gain LED's and lots of red lights.....looks cool in the rack.  I've seen sexier feedback eliminators, but for $150, this is as hot as she's gunna get.  ;-)                
This product does what it's supposed to do and does it well, after you've figured out how to use it without blowing your ears or speakers.  As I said before, autodetect functions are quite slow, but using the panic button to help her along greatly reduces the sound level required to trip a filter.                
No noise from the unit, and it does a great job of suppressing feedback.  Too difficult to use as a parametric EQ, don't waste your time.                
Easy to set up for Feedback suppression, and that is what I bought it for.  I have used it for over a year in my band's monitor amp & EQ rack.  We run four separate monitor mixes and I have used it to suppress feedback on two of those channels. Other channels feedback is regulated by a much more expensive Sabine filter and it does the same job at less than 25% the cost!  Way to go Behringer.                 
I have had no problems with the unit.  I did have the cheaper Behringer older unit ad I had "clock hash" noise always at a low level coming through and it was much slower and harder to use.  This unit has worked very well.                 
Great value.                
no experience                
Looks like a piece of rack mount audio gear, nothing special.                
This unit meets my band's needs and I don't plan on replacing it.                
I can't detect any noise from the unit.                
I use this as a parametric equalizer in manual mode.  Even though another review said this didn't make much sense it does to me.  The key is that this will do 1/60th octave filters.  This is amazing and is very usefull for room peaks for low frequency (sub-woofer) improvement.  Room treatments don't work very well at these frequencies and this product is the best solution.                
Setting up the filters manually isn't a big deal once you do it once.  Also, there is software avialable that will do it via MIDI download.                
I wish the side panels extended under the rack mounts wings.  You can't remove the wings or else the sides are open.  Overall, the build looks good.                
Very high value. I haven't found anything else that will do this for this kind of price.                
There documentation is OK but they could explain things a bit better about setting filters.                
The lights look cool until you want them off. :-)  I use this in a home theater setting and cover up the red LEDs because they are too bright.  For a rack look it would be sexy.                
I have not found any other product close to this value.  There are systems that can do filtering like this but at many times the cost.                
Great, fantastic. This Feedback Destroyer Pro actually does eliminate 99.9 % of the feedback. It is built like a super heavy duty quality tank. It works for me. Thanks...........                
I play in a damp club (basement type) and often the sliders and pots build up garbage which makes them noisy and scratchy. This happens on all my equipment. From Rane to Panasonic, all do the same. I expected Behringer to be the worse and to my surprise, my Behringer equipment is not experiencing this problem. Go figure...  Good stuff. As for sound quality, no different than my really expensive stuff.                
Just like any other expensive equipment. Good bang for the buck.                
If you cant use this, you cant use any other equipment of this type.                
Best in "bang for the buck" category.                
Best value.                
Dont need support, just throw it out and buy another at that price.                
bottom line is the equalizer works, its great for ringing out monitors on stage or inside the rehearsal room, BUT, I noticed a slight reduction in overall volume even when the EQ is bypassed, and when engaged it clearly reduces the volume compared to directly from the source, that's why I would only use it for monitors and not for the front of the house, the last thing you want is for the entire mix to drop in volume, with monitors it won't be that big of a deal as you can always increase the volume on the monitors themselves, other than that its a great unit that won't cost you much if you are trying to get the best experience with your rehearsal monitors or stage monitors, cuts the feedback very well and has a feedback detection feature (although I just use my ears)                
I bought this with several different uses, and I have come up with more since getting it. In live sound, I can use it as an EQ for a guitar. Also, I can run the main signals through my regular 31-band EQ, then into this, for two reasons: 1) I don't have the ear to know the feedback frequencies; I can pull down the FBQ800 band that is lit up, then figure out which band on the 31-band to pull down. 2) I use the 31-band for feedback; I can use the FBQ800 to shape the overall sound for the room.  I want to cut the feedback with as little impact on the music as possible. Also, this has allowed me to run in stereo (with a 2nd FBQ800), so I don't necessarily have to cut both sides to solve feedback.
Since I got this, though, I use it on one input of my TV (the main input, or the DVD player), and I can do a much better job with the sound than just the 2-band (bass/treble) TV EQ.  I can definitely notice the difference.  I want to get two more of these just for the TV.                
What is great are the FBQ lights, which show which band is getting feedback, or which band is getting the activity.  The thing is $60, though, so it has none of the frills of a serious EQ. Also, having both 1/4-inch and RCA inputs is a big deal.                
If you know how to use a graphic EQ, it's simple.                
It is made of plastic, and has a cheap feel.  I don't care, as long as I don't step on it.  I don't know what would happen if I dropped it on a hard floor.                
Very definitely worth the price.  I would like to buy 5-6 more.                
I have a number of Behringer products, and I have never had to deal with the company.  Not that I think I won't, some day...                
The Behringer FBQ800 is a really great piece of gear. I use it for small live sound applications with a pair of powered Mackie Thump 12 speakers and a Peavey PV8 mixer. It works exactly as advertised. If there is feedback, the appropriate slider lights up and stays RED and you slowly pull that level down until the feedback stops. It's pretty solid, but it  isn't built like a tank, so it can't be tossed around and abused. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.                
This is the best interface for Windows and Mac users, both USB and Firewire ports are working flawlessly. There are no problems with the drivers and the latency is zero! Great for recording a drum set or a live band. So far so good, gorgeous aluminium casing. 
And for the price it's like having it almost for free!                
So I just purchased one of the FCA1616 as a backup while my primary interface is out for repair, also figured being both USB and firewire would be a nice choice to have. 
I must say the main features for purchasing it are extremely disappointing. 
First being the adat expansion is completely non existent in terms of direct input monitoring. 
Meaning you must always monitor through your choice of DAW in order to hear your additional 8 channels over adat. 
Second being the headphone volume knobs are completely dependent on your main level output. (come on behringer, even the cheapest presonus 2 channel unit has dedicated volume level control on the headphone and the main volume output). The 2nd headphone jack can be switched to monitor your DAW line 3/4 output, which is pretty nice if doing a headphone buss mix, yet is pointless being that direct monitoring only happens over the 1/2 outputs only. 
Third, there's no actual level input meter. The green signal level turns "clip red" way before the DAW input monitoring shows actual clip. 
Fourth, and here's the worst part of all. The firewire option is completely useless. Since this is buss powered over firewire itself it constantly picks up the "digital distortion signal" from the computer's power supply since a power conditioner can not be used on a buss powered unit, power adapter plugged in does not override the buss powered feature. I wish there was an option to have it be dedicated to power only via the power adapter instead of firewire buss like all other 8+ channel firewire interfaces. 
Having to resort to USB2.0 on my primary studio computer is a huge turn off. 
The usb was a nice option for mobile tracking only on a no firewire laptop. 
Another huge disappointment is there is no software mix control, I understand this was built through DAW monitoring, yet why even tease the public with the option at all on the front panel if you're not going to make full potential of it?  
Only features I do like are the individually select-able features for each channel. 
Hi-z select swith, 48v, highpass filter, and pad.  
Once my main unit is back from repair, this is going back to the store, and keeping searching for another back up option. Such a shame since I was hopping it to be at least suitable for mobile tracking.                 
For the price, it's pretty good.  There is a little bit of hiss that I hear.  There are a couple things I would suggest.  I  would like them to have independent headphone, monitor and main output volume controls.  In order to hear the headphones loud enough, you need to turn the main volume up.  If you turn the main volume down, then the headphone volume goes down.  Make it easier to switch from Firewire to USB.  Also, needs to be a better manual. Also, having trouble with the midi.  This is the first Behringer product I've ever had any trouble with, so I might just have a faulty unit.                 
Based on my very first impressions, this is a fantastic unit for the price. I am returning it immediately, however, due to one incredibly short-sighted design flaw: The headphone outputs are wired post-main output knob, so the main output knob needs to be turned up in order for the headphones to get signal. For those of you with small project studios (Behringer's target market), that means you don't have independent control of your monitor speakers and headphones - such as when you want to turn speakers down to record vocals while keeping the headphones up. You can get independent controls by doubling your DAW's output to FCA1616 outputs 3-4 (extra time/hassle/potential latency) or by using an external monitor controller (extra $/gear/wiring). I really thought this unit would be perfect, but it's so slightly yet importantly not.                
Doesn't make any sound...                
I think the features in this unit are pretty nice.  There are 100 presets, and each preset can control multiple MIDI devices.  For example, with the push of one pedal you could send 5 different program change signals to 5 different MIDI instruments, 2 different control signals to two MIDI instruments, and set the two expression pedals to send MIDI control values 0-127 for two different controls on two different MIDI instruments.
Every once in a while I wonder why Behringer didn't give you the ability to send more than 2 controller signals instead of 5 program change signals with each preset - however it's really not limiting me yet.                
IN RESPONSE TO OTHER REVIEWS THAT CLAIM THE EXPRESSION PEDALS DON'T WORK:
Out of the box, my expression pedals didn't seem to work.  I calibrated the unit and they now work fine.  Just do a search on the web for the words "behringer", "footpedal", and "calibrate", or something like that - the calibration directions are all over the web.
Other than that, the quality seems pretty solid.  The expression pedals feel a tiny bit flimsy, but I haven't had any problems with them.                
For all the functionality you get in this product I think it's absolutely a good buy if you have multiple MIDI instruments that you'd like to use it with.  I think it might be a bit overkill if you're only using it with one - however there's nothing else out there that seems better, so it's a good buy for that too.
Understand that you should probably have an intermediate understanding of MIDI to get the most out of this and you'll have to spend a little time learning how to use it.                
Haven't had to use it yet.  All my questions have been answered by searching the web.                
i dunno - it's not particularly ugly, so....                
I'll probably have this for a long, long time.  Having two assignable expression pedals is great.                
Doesn't generate sound. Foot switch controller for Midi devices. In this case, used with a Johnson J-Station                
Features are that it is programmable for just about any MIDI device. Operators manual was pretty much useless. Very Poorly written.                
Seemes relatively strong. Metal case. Foot switches encased in rubber. I have had it over 18 months and use it weekly. I don't move it around too often. No case with it so I had to purchase a Fender Instrument Midi controller case.                
After corresponding with others that have tried other controllers, this one seems to have the consensus as best value for the money. Others may have a built in Tuner function, but this one is less expensive.  Most bang for the Bucks.                
I had to email Behringer's USA office to get the new software chips. Have had no other issues so no further contact with Tech Support.                
Nothing "Magnetically appealing" about it. Just functional.  Nothing to make one LUST after it.                 
Doubt if it will wear out. I doubt if I have the need to upgrade. Yes, it does help me meet my musical needs.
If it were lost or stolen, yes, I would buy it again.
I like it because it works. Once I learned how easy it was to program it, I liked it more. 
Again, the Operators manual, well,  sucked big time.  Completely useless.                
N/A - MIDI                
Lots of features for the money.  Despite the claims of other reviewers, the expression pedals on my unit work fine.  I had to calibrate them the first time I used it and haven't had any problems since.  Anybody whose having trouble with the pedals, read the manual and recalibrate them.
My main complaint is that you can assign 5 program changes, but only 2 sysex sends (CC or Control Change messages) per pedal.  I believe this is because the pedal is mainly designed to be used with guitar and bass amps that use MIDI to control effect settings.  I use it as a MIDI controller for software on my computer and have far more use for CC messages than program change messages (CC messages are what you use for midi control of knobs, sliders and buttons on your music software).  I suppose part of the blame goes to the software I'm using, as it won't allow one CC number to control multiple settings.                
Rugged, heavy.  I spilled beer on it, and it still works fine.                
Lots of features for the money.  I bought B-Stock, so it was even cheaper.                
Haven't needed to contact Behringer yet, which is a big plus.  Their manual, on the other hand, is one of the worst I've seen.  Behringer's Web site isn't great either.                
You get a lot of features for the money, which is why I bought it.  On the other hand, programming it is more complicated than it should be and the documentation is horrible.  A good buy if you're good at figuring things out on your own.                
This is a Midi foot controller so the sound really doesn't apply                
I own 2 of these controllers and use them for both my Fender CyberTwin and Cyber Deluxe.  They're programable if I have other midi type equipment that I want to use them on.                
There's a learning curve on just about everything that's out there today but, I was able to use this right out of the box without having to make any adjustments.  If I did want to access more capabilities I'd just have to program it and I'm there.                
I like this controller over my OEM Fender.  It's half the weight and half the price.                
It's half the price of OEM Fender controllers and they'll do the same job.                
Haven't had to deal with the company on this or any other Behringer equipment I've ever bought.                
It's practical and affordable.  Nothing special about the looks but the colors blend in with about everything else on stage.  Nothing stands out about it but, being it's a floor controller, I wouldn't want anything that really flashy.  It looks and works perfect for its application.                
As a main goal, it's to save money whenever possible.  This piece of equipment does everything I would expect of it and probably more if I needed it to.  No need to look for anything to replace it and it's flexible enough to use on other midi equipment if needed.  I'll have it as long as I have a need for it and at this time I don't see any reason for an upgrade, change, or replacement.                
Lots of pedals and two expression pedlas.  Thats plenty.                
I know first hand that it is a bear to figure out for most uses.  However, if you use it with the Behringer Vampire series of guitar effects and amps or with the Behringer V-Tone amps it is super easy to use.  It gives you so much more versitility with these amps.                
Built like a tank.                
Its inexpensive for what you get.                
Never need them.                
I now need this for use with my Behringer amps.  Without it would be tough.                
It works great and is reliable as can be.  What more do you need?                
would help if I could understand it better!                
Miriad of setup possibilities                
Manual is poor in terms of going through the set ups - not easy for a MIDI newbie                
Rugged and self contained                
The product is awesome. It is difficult to program but worth it. I use it with my V-amp pro works great.                
Easy to use once its programed to do what you want.                 
Very difficult to program. Found a guide for dummies on it and it made it a little easier to program.                
reasonably priced.                 
have not needed to .                
I own it.                
If it wasn't so hard to program I would give it a better score.                
lots of features, I can't imagine anything you could want to do with this thing that it can't *theoretically* be programmed to do                
Decent craftsmanship/solid as per usual with behringer products                
Decent value, again what you would expect from behringer                
not used for my sound just to control my behringer vamp pro                
support is not bad but i am having trouble finding an upgraded eprom chip 4 it                
 I LIKE THE FCB1010 DEFINATE PICE OF MY STAGE ARSONAL                
if i could find the eprom chips for it it could keep me 4 ever                
I bought this controller for my Avid Eleven Rack, and it is a huge disappointment. Instructions were minimal, even the manual that you have to download off the net. I tried contacting Behringer 3 times, and received no response. So back to my pedal board> Now I only use my eleven rack in a studio environment. I will never buy a Behreinger product again                
it doesn't make sound                
Flexible programming and easy to program. Good manual.
BUT
I have owned four over the last 5 years and all of them have had a switch or pedal break. While it looks and feels sturdy it is not. I treat all my instruments/tools with a lot of care and the units broke because they are not well made NOT because of abuse. I've had a Yamaha MFC10 foot controller on the road at the same time and never had any problems.                
Interface is nice. Flexible programming and easy to program. Good manual. Too bad they fall apart :-(                
No. I have owned four FCB1010's over the last 5 years and all of them have had a switch or pedal break. While it looks and feels sturdy it is not. I treat all my instruments/tools with a lot of care and the units broke because they are not well made NOT because of abuse. I've had a Yamaha MFC10 foot controller on the road at the same time and never had any problems.                
I'm MORE then happy to pay two or three times as much for another company's foot controller that is sturdy and reliable.
The FCB1010 may be inexpensive but it sure is unreliable.
You get what you pay for and the FCB1010 is proof.                
Difficult to contact and not at all helpful.                
doesn't matter how sexy it is if it breaks                
I will never buy another FCB1010 again. My living depends on reliable instruments.                
N/A                
Great features - I wish I wish I wish they would work because the only thing like them is an ART and they aren't too good at making things work either                
The expression pedals on three units failed to work. This is not good quality                
I want one so bad but i need them to work and the expression pedals do not                
No answer on e-mail
promised to call back - still waiting                
it has great features. I want it so bad I am about to reengineer it myself to get the expression pedals to work                
I think I have been clear. I won't go into the testing details but suffice it to say: In the programming mode you are supposed to be able to use expression pedal A to set parameter values. It won't even do that. I tried three units right out of the box                
Plenty of configuration available.  Maybe too much.                
Really difficult and time consuming to configure.  With any luck though, you'll only need to configure it once.                
The main pedals are sturdy, rugged and quick to respond.  The expression pedals are not so hot though.  They have a really small response range.  I'm tempted to replace the potentiometers and see if that'll give a more expressive transition from loud to soft.                
Great bang for your buck as pedals go.  Really low price but still gets the job done of most pedal boards.                
Meh... looks okay.  Nothing spectacular.                
this product sucks. it does not do half of what it promises. The pedals are absolutely worthless and when i called for support all i got was being put on hold!                
This product is a MIDI foot switch that controls other musical devices such as keyboards, sound modules, etc.  Therefore, it produces no sound.                
This product has no accessories.  All you need is a MIDI cable to connect this product to any other device that you would like to control.  And with a deep programming capabilities of this product, you would be able to produce a diverse range of features.                 
There is certainly a learning curve.  If you have some basic MIDI knowledge and you are willing to read the manual, you will have a very very very powerful MIDI footswitch.                
zZounds did a good job by having double boxed this product prior to shipping.  This double boxing method has kept the factory box look brand-new & pristine.  The product is very solid and well-built.  No loose parts & no blemishes.  The product looks elegant & expensive.  It also looks strong & sturdy for use "on the road".                
Given the diverse range of functions that this product is capable of, this product is much cheaper than other MIDI footswitches made by other companies.                
Because I have no issue with the product, I have no need to contact the company that made this product.                
As stated earlier, this product looks very elegant & expensive                
If this product were lost or stolen, I definitely would replace it.                  
a bit hard to program but i feed it into software so it's not a problem. it's got all the pedals i need!                
never had any trouble with it and i've used it for 3 years. I loan it out periodically to other musicians and i never worry it will be damaged. I'm only giving it an 8 because a good drop, or spilling liquid on it, would probably do it in.                
I'm giving it a 6 because I wish it was around $100. However I haven't seen any other pedals with a continuous-controller pedal built in and that's what I really want.                
idk. never had any trouble so i've never needed to call support!                
People ask me what it is all the time. Gigs, carrying it around, they see it and they want it.                
I don't know anything that compares to this feature set but I feel it could be better (i.e. I'm not giving it a 10). I own it and like (might buy another to keep in my home studio).                
The product does work as a keyboard volume pedal, however there is definitely a hum associated with it.  While playing it is not noticable, but is when no one is playing.                
There are very few features.  It has a knob that lets you set the max volume and you can control the volume for 2 instruments or left and right simulatanously.  It runs on 9V battery or 12V AC adapter - here is where the problem lays.  I can't find a 12V AC adapter that works.  Radio Shack no longer carries a multi-tap adapter.  You have to buy the adapter that fits it and they tried them all and said none of their's works.  Which is amazing considering that they have almost 50 different sizes at least.                
It is easy to use except when you have to change the 9V battery.  If you don't unplug the pedal after each use, your battery will be dead.  I wish Behringer sold a 12V AC adapter, but they only make a 9V one.                
Would pay more if it included the 12V AC Adapter.                
Haven't had to use yet.                
It's a volume pedal.                
I use this Unit in between my Mixer and ART PRO VLA II  and its a Great Unit for the Price. Most of my equipment must do double duty  right now at home in the Studio as well as out on the road in live venues. While I havn't  had  the chance to use this at a live venue as of yet I really can't wait to try it out the diffrence it made in my recordings was astounding.                
as with  most Behringer products it has almost too many features. I have  not had a chance to use every single one but each effect I have used is editable and saveable                 
I found it extremely easy to use. Read the quick Start Guide hooked it up  and that was that. I guess it might be intimidateing to some one less educated or experienced but that wasn't the case for me.                
I rate it an 8 on quality because of the cheap plastic knobs and the midi/mix knob gets really stiff about half way around (They may have designed it that way on purpose and if thats the case I wish they hadn't I would of preffered a smooth linear action)it free's back up right past the 1/2 way mark.                
I bought the blowout model at 1/2  price and I have to say this unit would of been worth the full price and then some  its worked perfectly far exeeding my expectations                
I can't Say havn't needed them as of yet.                
I don't really know how to answer this one so I rated it 6. While not just drop dead gorgeous it definatly added to the overall appeal of my Rack.                
I will keep this untill it dies for sure and even replace it. That being said I will be adding other equipment for stand alone features
 I love that it did what it said it would do and then some. I don't like the cheap plastic knobs and the midi/mix knobs sticky action                
Very easy to use. The sound quality is much better than many of the vst-plugins I've used, and build quality is really good. Only complaints I have, is that the main jogwheel is a bit too sensitive to my taste and it feels like it might brake down after some years of use, and that it could have more of different delay types.                
The sound is excellent and very customizable. I was very surprised as this unit is so cheap.                 
The Jogwheel makes it really quick and easy to skip through pre sets and effects and the midi knob makes it really quick to wet'n or dry up the effects mix and bypass the effects when needed,                 
Once you have read the manual and get use to the lay out it is really easy to use and edit. The knobs and jog wheel are very quick and responsive and make changing your settings very quick.                 
The unit is built very well. People keep complaining about the Plastic knobs and jog wheel but I like them. They have a rubber coating on them so its easy to grip and they are very responsive. It's made to be in a rack unit so as long as you have it in a decent raod case there should be nothing to worry about. The Frame is metal and display screen is a nice size.                 
In short IMO you get way more than what you pay for. A great unit for the studio or gigging.                 
Have not had to use yet.                 
Wow is all I can say.... 129.99 was not expecting this. More effects than I will ever need for my bass and can also use with my home studio. It looks very nice in your rack as well! If it was stolen or damaged I would for sure get another!                
Way more than what I expected. I bought this for my Bass rack and wasn't sure I would be able to use much of the effects for my bass but I was way wrong. All the presests are so customizable that you can make almost all of the presets sound good on any instrument. I use this on my bass rig and when at home I plop my rack down on the table and use it in my home studio on guitar, bass and vocals.                 
Love this behringer fx 2000 , people talk bad about Behringer but they make good products at a reasonable price. I never had any of my equipment to fail. This machine makes your music or live gig sound great. Thanks behringer.                
thought maybe the product would be less than expected for the price but OOOOPS,,this processor owns hands down.More than enough features to get any small or large job done..am not going to list the other items in my case just yet but i will say this FX 2000 is a great buy and addition to anyones case..thx                
The best cool effects, sounds good.                
unit works well .You want some thing special this is the one                
its a really good product just really wished could of bought on here                
This was the worst investment I've ever made.  The thing worked just one time - in practice session.  When we got to the gig, it had lost the settings, and just flat stopped having any effect at all.  It has never worked since; we pulled it out of the rack and don't even try any more.  It has soured me completely on Behringer.  Forget the sweet price, and spend a little more to get something that actually works.  These cheap pieces of garbage cost much more in the long run.                
Nothing about this piece of junk is worth mentioning...though we were able to use the power cord that came with it for other equipment that actually works.                
Programming it was a pain in the rear too.  Not user friendly or intuitive at all.                
Junk...undependable.  Cheap knobs too -- they break off very easily.                
I wouldn't pay a dime for this.                
Support? Didn't get a single call back from their automated help line.                
z - e - r - o                
Like nothing, hate everything about it including the company that pawned it off on me.                
I've read so many reviews from pedal snobs dissing Behringer, but don't go by the internet's negativity. It does what it's supposed to for 1/3 or the price. This is made of plastic, but it's sturdy solid plastic. Mine had no defects and all the functions work just fine, with no dirty noises. Effects are great sounding, with somewhat limited tweaking options.
I bought this to learn guitar effect usage at the same time as my regular guitar study, and it does make things much more alive. If new to these effects, best start with your single note exercises, for example: "Scarborough Fair" with a low repetition delay, "Jamaica Farewell" with moderate tremolo, or "Yellow Rose of Texas" with a fast chorus effect, using the neck pickup with tone dial turned down. This pedal will help you explore the endless tone combinations on your electric guitar. Combine with some backing tracks and you'll be surprised by what you hear. 
The pedal comes with very simple instructions, so just take it out of the box, add to your rig and start moving dials. I have this in the effects loop of a Fender FM212R, but you can also place it after your distortion or overdrive stomp box.
Get this, search for what popular songs use the effects provided with this pedal, and experiment.                
This pedal is decent. For the money you get some really good effects. the only downside is the pedal is made of plastic. I suggest you buy the power supply to supply it. the design of the battery placement is not that great.                
The sound is really the only reason i still use this product.                
It has alot of features but none that you cant get for a few bucks extra from Digitech.                 
The first time i get this pedal it was dead, so i sent back and got a new one that kind of worked. i had to play with the knobs to get it to work and some times it would cut out for no reason, also the first 3 knobs do not do what they describe.(ex. the Level knob does not control the output level as described in the instructions.)                
I have this pedal on my board as a "back up" type pedal, i only use it for some effects on some songs. i have to play with it before a show to make sore its working and i fear it will break or cut my guitar out at any second. this was not built at all well, though the visual appearance is not to bad the electrical quality was a waist.                
The value was all most worth it but not fully worth what i payed.                 
I have not dealt with Behringer before but most of my products from them are defective so i stopped getting Behringer products. Every time i need to return an item zzounds helps and they are amazing with help.                 
The "sex appeal" is maby a 4.                 
I would turn this product in for anything else without a second thought.                 
This thing actually sounds pretty good for what it is.  The delay, chorus, and phaser are primarily what I used it for.  They were all a bit limited, but adequate sounding for a super-cheap multi.  You'll find that if you are serious about getting a good chorus, for example, you will have to buy a dedicated chorus.  Probably not a Behringer one.  Still, the chorus that comes with this multi really does have some good settings, as do the other effects.                
This thing really does do it all for under $40.  The number of effects you get is staggering.  And the ability to adjust them is pretty good.  If you really just want to experiment with adding different effects to your sound, the features of this are great.                
The knob to select the type of effect you are using is analog, which makes it a bit of a pain to line up your effect.  The two tweaking knobs aren't always clear what they do.  Still, it is basically easy to use.  Select the effect and play with the two knobs until it sounds the way you want it.                
Quality is where the pedal truly falters.  This is the first Behringer pedal I've had really crap out on me.  Let me tell you, when it craps out, it is truly spectacular.  Even the on/off doesn't work properly.  The off position always produces a screwed up phaser sound.  The on position sometimes still works.  But lets face it, if you can't turn it off, it is worse than useless.  I would HATE to have something like this happen on stage.  Because of this, I am working on replacing all my Behringer pedals with EHX, in case I go on the road, and I need reliability.                
The value of this thing would be staggering if not for the fact that it broke.  I have had it for maybe a year, and it went kaput.  It is a great 'slot filler' for your pedal board.  If you have some extra space, and you don't know what you want to put there, this is something to buy.  It lets you experiment with chorus, flanger, phaser, delay, etc.  The key word being 'experiment.'  Once you find out what you really use a lot and want to add to your sound (in my case chorus and delay), chuck this thing and buy a really good dedicated effect.  I'm an EHX fan, but there is plenty out there better than this.                
Did not use.  I fully expected to have issues with a Behringer pedal at some point.  This thing is a throw away for me.  If it breaks (and it has), I plan on replacing it with an EHX pedal.                
Nobody things Behringer is sexy.  I was trying out for a cover band, and I think I was automatically one down to whoever else tried out just for having so much Behringer EQ.  It is highly frowned upon, and you will not be viewed as a serious player while playing this EQ.                
There is, however, and upside to this pedal.  It does work great out of the box, and if you are careful with it, it can be a good experimental slot filler on your board.  Don't let it come to any hard crashes.  Don't accidentally feed back the input into the output.  Be careful when using stereo patch cables.  Don't cross up A and B.  I'm not sure which of these things ended up breaking mine.  I have a feeling it was when I created a feedback loop in my pedal chain.  All the rest of my stuff survived it with no problem, but that was right around the time I really started having trouble with this Behringer Multi.                
the effects are crap compared to BOSS or any other high name brand                
a ton of features you have 6 different effects and adjustment knobs                
hard to get a decent sound                
poorly made!                
stopped working The FIRST time i replaced batt's                
it appealed to me because i had experience with other behringer products  and they were amazing... plus it was cheap with a lot of effects.                
considering that it broke so fast i'll give it a 4 but if it would have worked longer i would have given it a 6ish.                
Has good sound, when it makes any. I don't remember many details because it worked so briefly but I was excited initially to hear it.                
The effects themselves are nicely grouped together in one package                
Easy to use, comfortably controlled                
Broke twice from simple operation, no stomping, transporting, or abuse involved. Main concern                
Maybe if you baby it and use the stereo function it would be worth something.                
I don't know, never called Behringer directly for support but there was no repairing the item and no factory issued warranty which isn't disappointing exactly for the money. I still support Behringer                
Looks good in pics, but up close you see that it's plastic which is a turnoff if you're looking for a professional appearance.                
Have your thirty dollars ready? Now take your money, roll it up, and burn it. Congratulations, you just accomplished the equivalent of purchasing a Behringer multi-effects pedal. This item quit after the first time I used it once, I had it replaced on warranty through the seller and after three uses, the second pedal was in the same condition. The red light comes on and no sound comes out. Save yourself the money, a lot of headache, and possible gig embarrassment by NOT buying this.                
I am used to playing through a class A tube amp, but needed something for church to use my custom pedal board. I was pleasantly surprised with the sound I got from this box. Convincing tube amp sound through the PA. As a DI box, this is the best electric sound I've had playing through a PA system. Great clean sound was very easy to find.                
Not a lot of features, which is nice. Simple to get a good clean sound. I have boutique overdrive effects so I was looking for something clean. Simple tone controls. You can also get a nice overdriven sound with this but I preferred my pedals for that.                 
Very easy to use. Plug it in, dial in your sound, and go. Doesn't get much easier than that.                
This pedal is well made, but it is plastic. I knew that. Sound wise it compares to other similar pedals, but this is a third of the price. You get what you pay for. I leave this on the platform at church and it never moves. I don't think it would hold up to use on the road, but it's good for what I need it for and for what I paid for it. Seems like it will be reliable as long as it is taken care of.                
For the price this can't be beat. You could spend a lot more on similar items that might be built better, but you'll pay for it.                 
I have never dealt with the company. From what I've heard I don't know that I will ever have to.                
This is just a practical addition to my set up. Patty Griffin and Emmylou Harris provide sex appeal for me, not equipment.                
Good piece of equipment, depending on how long it lasts will determine my overall satisfaction with this pedal. If it were lost or stolen I would have to get another one just for the sheer value and effectiveness of it for the price.                
It's not bad at all. Tweed clean with the drive all the way down is the only setting that will actually do a truly clean setting. But it's a decent tweed sounding clean. Distortion sounds are useable and better then I expected.                 
I love the XLR output and the quarter inch (non speaker simulated) output. Very cool. I wish other sans amp units would take note of this.                 
Pretty straight forward and self explanatory. If you can use an amp you can use this.                 
Haven't had it long, but it's a bit more robust build quality then I would have expected, for the money. And for the money, if I get a year out of it, I'll be happy.                 
For the money this thing is great. It does make a bit of noise, but nothing unacceptable for a live situation. Great for a small budget studio. Or an apartment studio with no ability to use an amp. I use it for late night practice and recording without waking the whole neighborhood.                  
Never used it.                 
Overall I'm very pleased with this unit. Especially considering the price I paid for it. Had I paid more I might not have been so happy with it though.                 
The different sounds are fairly authentic. I use it primarily for recording. It hums a little more than I'd like it to...but what pedal doesn't?                
Very easy to use. Just plug in and fiddle around!                
Seems very solid. I've only used it in the studio but, I would gig with it and be confident it would meet my needs.                
Big bang for the bucks.                
It's not sexy....it just does the job well.                
Short of going out and buying three full sized amps, I couldn't ask for more from this pedal. I still have and use some 30+ year old pedals...I hope this one lasts as long. If it did break or wear out I would probably replace it.                
The unit models 3 different amps and also allows straight pass-thru. The output levels are wildly different, the tweed level is very low, the straight-thru is a little louder, and the 2 others are crazily louder, making it very tricky to switch between them. Also, even with the drive set to the lowest setting, the 2 non-tweed settings distort (my mixer wasn't indicating overload, so the distortion was coming from the Behringer).
I actually thought the unit was defective following an exchange with tech support, and ordered a different one from a different source, and it was exactly the same. The tweed setting did sound a little bluesy, but muffled (I play blues). For the record, I was playing through a Mackie FX-12 mixer and Mackie SRM 450v2 speaker; the mixer has a DI box option built into one channel, and the guitar (1980 Gibson 335s with Dirty Fingers pick-ups) sounded better through that channel and integrated DI than through the Behringer into a normal channel.                
I purchased my Ultra-G direct box out of intrigue, and I'm glad I did. I am an experienced player, performing at some of the top night clubs in Columbus, OH with built in sound and experienced sound engineers. Every one of them has complimented the sound of the Ultra-G box, and at least two of them have decided to buy some of them based on hearing how good mine sounds. It's better than a mic in a live setting when used through a conventional line out, hands down. If you think otherwise, you must be using it incorrectly.                 
For what I needed it works great. Very quiet (with explanation!!!!)
QUIET EXPLANATION:  On my unit if I tried to engage the 4x12 speaker simulation, thats when I got a low hiss, and it stayed low, would not go up in volume when I raised the volume on the guitar but did when dialed in from the amp. So it was coming from the unit but since I do not use that function, no issue for me.  Otherwise the unit does not generate any noise what so ever when used just as a DI.  
It works great and is very rugged.  No issues.  Some complain about the batter access, I again found that it seemed pretty easy to change so no issue and I have also used it phantom powered.                 
Very easy to operate, love the pad switches, very useful when going into a mixer. Love the direct line out for monitor situations.                
Well made and Rugged. Set it and forget it.                
Compared to others this pedal gives you a tremendous bang for the buck. Buy it, if you don't like it, return it or just give it to a friend.                 
No experience with support, I own a few behringer devices and pedals and all work well.  Have not had to deal with Behringer support.                
Looks Good.                
Only con to this box is the noise from engaging the speaker simulation.  Since I don't use that function.  Does not matter.                
Very clear sound.  Put my guitar "up-front."  Watch out for your levels.  I was surprised at how much this little thing puts out!                
The cab simulation is very nice.  I suppose it could be better, but not for this price!!                
Good quality.  Built very well.  And, personally, I like the way it looks.                
This gets a definite 10!  Great product, at a great price!                
Haven't had any problems, but Behringer has never given me any problems with support before.                
Very useful, a must have for the down-to-earth musician.                
Like I said, great product.                
Ive compared this to alot of others and the sound is astounding! Creates a really big sound without the hassle of micing! use a mic and this box and your every nuance will be heard live!                
I wasn't sure if I wanted to get this, but at the price and the return policy, I didn't have anything to lose. Well after the reviews, which were on point, it's gonna serve me alright. I'm using it with my Fender Rhodes 73. Didn't like it for the guitar rig because of the hiss from the cabinet simulator, and I also ran into a RED BOX Classic. If I didn't have the Classic, I would be using it, except for the cab sim. Nice for the money.                
These DI's are quite nice, only seeming to have one sonic weakness, and that is the cabinet simulation causing a fair amount of hiss.  The cabinet simulation won't satisfy everyone, but as a live sound engineer, I like its overall tone more than simply having an amp (usually with the high frequencies at painful levels) blasting away in the room.                
This DI does everything a DI should do, and slightly more.  I just wish that the cabinet simulation didn't introduce any noise into the signal.                
I had one of these suffer a death where the input jacks seemed to somehow develop a short.  I opened the DI to see if there was anything I could do, but the jacks are sealed (and soldered to a PCB.)  What opening the box revealed, though, was that you would probably have to subject the box to a rather nasty impact to actually damage the electronics.                
Behringer has a reputation for lots of features for a low price, and this DI is a perfect example of that.                
I've only spoken to Behringer once, and they seemed quite helpful.                
This is a great addition to a live sound engineer's arsenal, although it doesn't inspire the same "it's nuke-proof" response as more heavily built DI boxes might.                
I am buying at least one more of these to make up for the one that had a problem.  The 4X12 simulation puts these DI's at the head of the pack for me.                
It sounds ok, I usually use the cab sim, its a little noisy but for my application this is a non-issue.  So I take the second speaker out of my twin reverb and go to the pa board as well as my recording setup (through an xlr splitter).  I like that there's no bleed from other instruments as opposed to using a mic.  On the recordings if I add some muktiband compression and reverb it comes out sounding pretty realistic.
On the other hand, I'm not satisfied yet (who is?), so I'm still trying other boxes.                
The cab sim sounds pretty nice and with the twin reverb blasting I use both 20db pads to get it down to a reasonable level for the pa.  It seems really rugged too which is nice.                
I would like to see a couple different speaker sims ala the palmer passive DI to shape your sound a few different ways.                
Very good, I didn't expect it to be this rugged.  Although, I wish it were passive, I hate using phantom power (and no way will I trust a battery at a live show).                
Never dealt w/them                
Well its a DI, certainly not a sexy piece of gear.                
Aleays searching for something better, haven't found anything yet.  I prefer this guy to micing the amp though.                
The sound is great. No buzz, No hum and the cab simulator is fantastic! Most DI boxes I've tried on guitar heads have a High-Freq. artifact to the output, not this one. I'm not sure why others complain about noise with the cab simulator because I have not experienced this. Very quiet and no High-Freq artifact!                
Very basic design and easy to use. The battery compartment is way to small though.. better to use this via phantom power.                
Built like a tank and I've road tested mine now for over a year.. I've just ordered my second one!                
Behringer has always been priced right!                
Never had to contact support.                
I really don't want to go back to micing up my cab live anymore. This box solved allot of live sound problems and I've got the rest of my boys using one as well. On my last CD I even recorded all of my solo's using just the Ultra-G (my head - Ultra G - ProTools) and it worked great (box handles 500W!!).. I can't live without it now!                
Overall this product is killer.. I'm still curious as to why others complain about noise with this but so far live and in the studio I have not seen this problem (I always run balanced lines so maybe they're converting over to unbalanced or something??) Anyway, I'm very impressed with the Ultra-G and for it's price you can't beat it! - MX  www.phist-productions.com                
Very realistic emulation of a mic-ed cabinet. A world of difference between simply running a DI and running the emulator. I very much prefer the sound of using the Behringer after my preamp over simply using a Tech21 Sansamp.                
Active single channel DI with "4x12" cabinet emulator. If only it came in dual channel version, for running stereo, and more options on the speaker emulation.                
Decent build quality. But as I noticed with some Behringer products, the battery compartment is a no brainer. It is way too small, making it difficult to insert and remove the battery. And they should have a more accessible cover as well. A screw over a metal plate isn't exactly the best idea.                
Excellant for the money!                
Never dealt with em, but their website is pretty informative.                
I went from DI to DI lookin for the right sound, this nails it right on. I want the freedom to use my own preamp & efx processors and have a DI box that has a speaker emulator. Sansamps sound terrible for that, only decent running standalone.                
Great product, will definately buy another in a heartbeat if this one gets lost.                
Cabinet emulation, which is why I bought this though I have Ultra DI100 from Behringer (which by the way works great!) makes a lot of noise. Cabinet feature is USELESS.
DI is great just as its cousin DI100. 
But forget the cabinet emulation.                
This baby cranks!!! Wanted to feed my headphones from my mixer rather than my 200 watt amp in my rack, but the output was took low for my "too long" in biz ears"....the little Behringer amp did the trick for 20 bucks! Fairly clean, and loud.                
4 separate amps with individual controls.                
Very simple to use                
Nice metal box...the knobs feel solid.                
no experience                
not sexy just works                
Clean, punchy and clear-no noise that I can hear. Drives even difficult headphones well.                
Comes with it's own wall wart- nice. Does what it should.                
4 individual volume knobs...how much easier can it get?                
Rating of 9, not 10 'cause there's gotta be a catch somewhere. Solid aluminum case. Don't step on it and it'll last for a long time.                
Direct dealer exchange for faulty product, responsive email support.                
I got one and gave it to my church. Now I want one for ME!                
This is being used in an unusual way- coming off of the matrix output of a Mackie Onyx large format mixer to distribute a non house mix to video and audio recording. The live mix is too heavy on vocals and keyboard, since everyone else uses their amps onstage. The matrix submix lets us compensate for that, and the HA400 lets me distribute that mix cleanly to different recorders at different levels. Perfect to feed a collection of pro- and consumer-grade units the church uses!                
Don't care what people say about Behringer, they make great, affordable products. Won't say much about this one except read the other reviews cause they're spot on! For the low price, thus headphone amp rocks! I will warn however that if you purchase it with the 4 Samson headphones (which I actually recommend doing) don't expect them to sound good. In fact, they're pretty crappy lol. That being said, you aren't going to be using them for sound quality. They're just for letting musicians play at the same time to get through the recording process. Again, the headphones are crap but for the extra $25 they'll serve their purpose and are worth the extra few bucks. Just make sure whoever is wearing them knows that you know they suck but they get the job done.                 
The sound is "LOUDER". it takes ANY one of my state of the art headphones and increases the volume much more than before. The sound is going to still vary depending on your headphones.
I own: regular ipod earbuds, cheap no brand head phones, Sennheiser 280HD, Logitech NCH, Bose Over ear, and Ultrasone HFI700.
ipod earbuds: with the amp, the sound was just louder, bleh. just pretend turning up the volume on the earphones until they blow. a bit distorted after turning them to high.
cheap headphones: theres no brand. they sound like crap. with the amp they sounded much better. but to me the sound was still pretty bad. 
Sennheiser 280HD: These are awesome cans to begin with and without the amp these are my favorite headphones because its high in quality and its cheap! They produce amazing highs and mids but lack a punchy bass. with the amp, they made these headphones with a much punchier bass but the highs sometimes were to high. nothing is distorted but just SUPER LOUD!!! which is a good thing because all you have to do is make sure your source volume is somewhat lower and bring the amp power higher. overall it made an improvement with my headphones but when it comes down to it. I can live without the amp with these headphones since these are almost perfect for what they are.  
Logitech NCH: These logitech head phones have decent amount of bass. the highs and mids are average but with the amp it was almost a world of a difference. i tried listening to music with these but the bass was just too much after awhile but then i put on a movie and it was almost insane! i think these would be the perfect movie headphone when paired with this amp because it makes the highs and mids better and the bass much more explosive. so when you're watching a scene where theres a huge explosion you can hear the sharpness and the earthshaking bass. ok maybe earthshaking is wAAAAAy exaggerated but thats okay because its still quite noticeable. overall, the amp is a must with these headphones.
Bose Over ear: I know a lot of audiophiles wouldnt say a lot about bose because there are much better stuff out there like Grado, AKG, Sennheiser, etc. but i really like these headphone because its probably the most well balanced headphones I've ever listen too. Its has good highs and mids while having a very VERY thumping bass. perfect for any music genre. these headphones become very powerful when connected to this amp. since these headphones are so well balanced everything becomes enhanced in every way. Again, the amp is a must accessory with my bose headphone.
Ultrasone HFI700: This headphone is my pride and joy. No one touches these or puts them on but me. music just sounds different with these headphones. when i say different, i mean it in the best way as possible. The sound can not be explained. it just cant. no matter what i say, no matter what i type, no matter how hard i try nothing will be able to describe how good these cans are. Now as i paired it with the amplifier the headphone became a live. 
no feature. it does one thing. adds more power to the headphones to give louder/ sound. but ask yourself, is louder better? HELL YEAH IT IS!                
its so easy even you can do it. = )                
alloy casing. average weight for its size. if i dropped it i wouldn't be concerned because its built VERY sturdy.                 
c'mon dude 20 bucks for a mini amp that can make your ears bleed?! FTW!                
the best support is no support. if i didnt have to pick up the phone to call then everything is alllllllllll good.                
i wanted to see how much better it could improve some of my head phones.                  
I'm completely satisfied with this product. Just understand that this amp will improve the sound by making your content LOUDER. since i own only 1 earbud i really can't be much help to other owners who perfer earbuds. in my own test, i found that the ipod earbuds is not needed. adjusting the volume knob on the amp to high will cause the earphones to get distorted very easily. As for headphones, it is a must. whether you like listening to rock, death metal, country, classical, blues, hiphop or watch dvds it will make your experience much more enjoyable. 
I'm going to find away to  hook this up to XBOX 360 and play gears of war on my headphones i bet it would be amazing as well.                 
Does what it was made for amplifying the signal very nice and clean (using a nice pair of headphones of course). y use it as extra monitor output with clarett 8pre                
I bought 2 of these to replace homemade ones without volume controls in my studio.  The price was great and they were shipped quickly.  I tested all of the outputs and everything works great on them.  I was surprised at how small they are and was expecting them to be a little bigger but the size doesn't bother me.  They don't seem to add any noise to the signal path and they look good.                
better than I hoped for ,I bought the pack with the 4 nady phones was worried about the bad rap the phone have but so far they have held up fine .The amp is plug and play simple and noise free . For the price it was worth a shot .only problem I have is the line in and headphone outs are on the same side of the unit                 
I bought the Behringer Headphone Amp with the Nady Headphone Package (with four sets of headphones). Obviously, in a bundle like this, I didn't expect the headphones to be great, but they're adequate. The in-line, volume adjustment is a plus, but the stereo mini to stereo 1/4" adapters are sub-par. 2 out of 4 are useless.                 
Very pleased with the service and quality. Arrived in record time. Thank You so much.                
Hum and noise are non-existant.  I use the amp at low volume levels for late night TV viewing.  The bass is tight and the highs are smooth.  I am very happy with my purchase.                
Simple and easy to use.  Most all of my connections are 3.5mm, so had to find adaptors, but would rather have 1/4 phone as they seem to hold up longer.  Have had problems in other equipment with 3.5mm jacks breaking.                
Plug it in and go.  Didn't need a manual.                
I would have paid the price for a single channel amp.  This has 4.                
Did not have to contact company.                
This product is not sexy.  It is a practical design that gets the job done.                
This will last me a very long time.  I might consider buying a second one for the car so the kids can watch a dvd when we travel.                
My home studio set up is on a tight budget, and I just needed several singers to monitor tracks while laying down vocals.  There seems to be plenty of power (volume) in the headphones with no discernable distortion even at high volumes.                
This cost $19.99 - so don't expect any features besides individual volume controls.  It is perfect for what it is.                
Plug it in and go!                
Very simple metal box, single LED, 4 knobs.  All seems pretty solid.  I've had no trouble at all using it so far.  I was skeptical what I would get for so low a price, but I feel like this is a value!                
Seems like a great value for the price!                
N/A                
This is not a sexy item.  This is a "gets the job done, and done well on the cheap" type of item.                
This will do for me until the time comes when I am sure I want to invest more money into a more professional home studio.  When I do, Behringer will be my first choice.                
I ride a motorcycle and have three input devices.  Radar detector (mono), XM radio (stereo needs amplified), could have GPS mono voice.  The mixer/amp worked great on the motorcycle and the individual volume levels for each input was usful on set up.  During driving, the individual devices (except XM) could be adjusted.  If radar went off in city, its volume could be turned down.                
Could you build one that has 1/8th inch input/output.  Again, I see a great motorcycle potential as is and even better with modifications.  The modifications should not cost $55.00 but you could ask that much more for an "improved" product.                
I give sound a ten because i cant find anything wrong with it. seems clear and loud. no complaints.                
I give features 7 beacuse although it is incredibly ease to maintain and operate, it does not have the simplest or most functional feature, the ON/Off switch. You basically have to keep it plugged in and theres a glowing green light that gets kind of annoying if its on all the time. so leave it plugged in, or bend over to plug it in every time.                 
Could not be easier to use. plug and go! no instructions needed!!                
very light, almost too light. but straight, and to the point. i had to put four little rubber feet on the bottom so it didnt scratch my other gear and so i didnt have to hold it with both hands to plug something in/out.                
cannot be beat for the price! Period! I would have paid AT LEAST twice what it costs if i were to guess.                
havent needed any...                
Sex appeal?? hardly. its a rigid little metal box with pointy corners and knobs sticking out...but if your into that sort of thing, thats a whole other story...                
Overall had to give 9. it functions well and cannot be beat for the price. but could not give a 10 for lack of the ON/OFF switch. other than that. its excellent.                
I shopped several brands and models of headphone amps for GizmoProductions.net, and wanted something portable to move to where the artists were recording, so that THEY could have control of their volume, similar to an Aviom. It works great for 2-4 vocalists or a vocalist/guitarist duo, or any other configuration. Great price, great simplicity, sturdy construction, and a great deal with the optional headphones!                
Don't waste your money.  I understand that it only costs $20 and you can't expect it to knock your socks off but I thought I'd be able to get a reasonable volume level out of it! BAH!!!  I can't get it turned up even a quarter of the way it's all noise, noise and noise. It's junk.  RUN AWAY NOW!!!                
not too shabby! (for behringer...)                
well, it does what it's supposed to. I dont think this product exactly
has any "features!"
Dear Behringer:
In the next model, please put the headphone jacks on the front and the
input/power on the back! (duh!!) And make it rackable with a bunch next to it. And give it some pretty lights. And make the space where it says "level 1, level 2" a whiteboard-like material that you can use wipable markers on. Or better yet, make it a big LED screen programmable by USB, so I can put the name of each person's mix on it. Oh and I guess while you're at it, please add Auxiliary inputs and blend pots. And make the power supply internal. Or battery powered. Or both. Am I asking too much?                
It's metal - nice one boys!                
OK I gotta admit it's dirt-friggin-cheap and does exactly what they advertise. I don't feel ripped off having bought this; I knew exactly
what I was getting into.                
N/A/ Who the heck needs tech support for a headphone amp like this? I can't believe I'm writing this review....                
Just saw it, bought it, whatever.                
I wasn't exactly searching the world over for something like this. I do get a lot of comments about it though. 6/10.                
the 60hz hum is ridiculus. cant believe nobody has noticed this, a waste of good money                
This product sounds fine if you're simply hooking headphones directly into the unit.  In fact, it sounds quite good.  However, it DOES NOT WORK over long distances (25' - 50') of low gauge wire, such as a snake.  I believe this is due to impedance issues.                
This has the basic features you need to split and individually amp a signal 4 times.  It lacks 1/8" in/out, but that's solved using an adapter.                
Doesn't get any easier than this.                
This unit looks and works fine.  The knobs feel a little chintzy, but not too bad.  However, I have other Behringer equipment that feels a lot sturdier than this, so this is certainly not their shining product.                
Impedance issues aside, this is a very good deal.                
It's functional, but not sexy.                
The unit sounds good, but only if you're jacking a pair of headphones directly into it.  It doesn't work over long runs of low gauge wire (such as a snake), making it unsuitable for many professional/semi-pro studios.  I returned the unit and bought an ART HeadAmp4 - WELL WORTH THE EXTRA $20.  The ART is much better built, the knobs feel nicer, it's stackable, and it has 1/8" and 1/4" jacks.  If you have a pro studio, go with the ART.  If you've got a small home studio and don't intend to expand, the Behringer will probably work well for you.                
I got this thing as we(the band) needed it because during recording our drummer had a hard time hearing the guitar/bass tracks(we're using an fostex x-16) and therefore had a hard time keeping tempo, He was never really of by much, but as a musician I am sure you know already it doesn't take much to ruin a good tune by being just a hair off tempo.                
Simple device                
Just plug in your headphones and crank the volume up, Doesn't get much easier than that.                
Have had no problems so far, It's built pretty tough although it just rests on a desktop for recording so I haven't really tested it in rougher conditions than the home studio. I am also really gentle on all my gear so I don't foresee any major problems with this box.                
We bought this amplifier mainly because of the drummer he can now actually hear everything the guitars are doing and hits the timing dead on like he should so that makes it worth quite a bit to us. The other neat feature is we can hook up multiple headphones now also, so while I am mixing tracks the rest of my bandmates can grab a pair a headphones and listen to the mixdown as well.                 
Haven't needed any support.                
It's perfect for what we needed for. If you happen to record your rough drafts & demos on old school equipment like us this will help you out for sure. Heck, even if you use more modern equipment it doesn't hurt to have a volume boost for your headphones. It also seems to bring out some good definition in the sound as well. Overall I'd say buy one even if you think you may not need it. It's defiently a useful tool to have hanging around just in case.                
The channels that worked were clean, but the first one I received had a dead left channel on the #1 output. I returned it and they sent me another which had dead left channel on #2 out put. Exchanged it for an ART unit which seems to be working very well.                
The two units I have had both had bad out puts.                
I use this to amplify my claretts 8pre outputs via TS cable direct into the HA8000 inputs, being able to make separate monitor mixes via DAW. The signal amplification is just perfect and enought to track or as daily use. Love it                
Bought this headphone amp back in March of this year.  While it worked, it  did what it was supposed to do.  However, it just quit on me two days ago.  So, all told it lasted me exactly 6 months.  That's what I get for trying to buy on the cheap.  Do yourself a favour and steer clear of this Behringer product.                
I absolutely love the sound of this pedal.  I (like most of us) am very meticulous with my sound and this Hellbabe pedal really hit the mark.  I'm able to use it quite comforably with Damageplan, BLS and Metallica-style covers.  I also use the Ibanez Weeping Demon - a good pedal, but the Ibanez sucks a little tone (still good for less 'heavy' uses), whereas I don't have that same issue with the Hellbabe.                
Real simple to use with the optical on-off.  I haven't experienced the 'noise' issue others have in the ratings, but I did experience the pedal not switching off automatically when I removed my foot.  I opened the case (from the bottom) like I had to do with my old Morley and pushed the optical 'eye' down just slightly and BAM, problem fixed.  So...I don't know how long it'll hold up with gigging (I've found myself being a little more tender with it now when moving it around), but there are very few moving parts so it'll be an easy adjustment if something goes outta whack.  The plastic casing is fine.                
I've had Crybaby's/Morley/and Ibanez and they've all had 'issues' of some sort, so the fact I had to minimally adjust the optical eye is not an issue to me.  It's been fine ever since and sounds awesome.                
Absolutely fantastic.  It IS, for all intents-and-purposes, the Dimebag Wah (for $150) but for $29 (minus the metal dime-o-flage casing).                  
I haven't needed it...that's the best kind of support.                
Well...I chose a nine because it looks like every other standard wah...nothing more special (or less).                
If I totally break (or lose) this thing, I'll definitely replace it with another Behringer Hellbabe....definately.                
Adjustable tones                
Good quality                
It does what it's supposed to at a fraction of the cost.  I dare you to find another Wah pedal for less than this one.                
It's a perfectly good pedal.                
I don't see any need to buy a more expensive pedal.  What can other wah pedals do that this one can't?  If you want a good pedal for a great price, this is it.                
The overall sound of this unit is every bit as good as Dunlop Wah
its designed to emulate, I tried this thing side by side with a Dimebag Crybaby before i bought it and the difference in sound was
very minute. Comparibly an excellent effect at a fraction of the
cost of its rival.                
This product features a few very usefull controls that you don't
find on every wah, Q-control, adjustable frequency range, I.E.-
highs and Lows, toe down range control, and a boost level adjustment,
not to mention the fact that its activated by optical control instead of a push button toe switch.You do however have to play around with the boost and time adjustment for the on/off switch to avoid excessive noise during paused playing parts.                
The guts of this effect seem to perform very well, however the 
body is only high impact plastic , but it seems quite solid.
The one thing they could do to improve this unit is to put
the guts in a metal case.                
Very good value for the price.                
No service needed so far.                
Well its not really an attractive effect, but it does its job and
sounds good in the process. It was a practical addition to my
set up,i bought 2 of these to use in my pedal boards for my Pantera tribute band.                
I'm very content with these units, if they broke I'd probably
replace the unit with the same. I like the fact that this unit sounds
every bit as good as the other $200 wahs that i already own, at a third of the cost.                
I dont know how I lived without it,even playin with myself its better than sex.                
Worst feature unfortunately is its low power comsumption,when plugged into a normal power supply,around 800ma,it clips badly losing much of
its dynamic sound range(which really is quite good).I'd like to see it with own power supply built in,right now,(I use wall warts).Dont think it actually needed all that gain,but its handy,I guess.                
Just plug it in and get your ROCKS OFF!                
Seems solidly built,but I'm not that abusive with musical instraments,after thirty some years playing with minimal monies coming in a person learns to take care of things.                
Kiler diller!                
Not yet.                
Well designed,well built,very responsive too my desires.Sh goes well with other mind candy,very compatible type,a nice personality that goes well its other traits.                
A while.It stands on its own merits.Wanted similar for quite some time but purchased things for other instraments,flute,and am now plenty glad that I found this one and think I would seek out another identical to it.                
Got a Mprley Pro2, and this bad Pedal puts it to shame.If you master the adjustments, it kicks.Made solid,ease of use. Also have after that a Ultra Wah, what a combo.It will take a beating, supply is only $10,(do a little shopping).I like it better that Dunlop, Morley, and price is Great.                
Makes a little click that's annoying when the wah is activated.                
Not Bad                
READ THE DIRECTIONS!!                
Plastic seems to stand up OK.  I own one and my son also owns one and both have had the hinge pin slip out the right side requiring that after some use you have to push it back in.  Otherwise yo may be surprised with a loose pedal                
Compared to the price of others, this is a great value...                
Haven't had to contact them for support.                
Looks fine...Hey it's a pedal.                
I would rather have a Crybaby, but for the price and my budget at the time, this was fine.                
It sounds the same or better than all the other pedals i've tried. It has a knob that lets you change the ammount of wah which is useful.                
It has a boost feature and you can change the ammount of wah you want. I find the springback feature on this pedal easier to use than the Crybaby style one, but thats just a matter of personal taste.                 
Its a wah peadal. Not exactly complicated.                
It seems fairly rugged, however i would not be confident to stand on it. I think it'll last a few years but deffinately not for ever. But then it only cost 30 pounds.                
Great value for 30 pounds. It will probably last a while and does the job just as well as a more expensive model would.                
I dont know.                
I'd rather have a crybaby but this is a great pedal for intermediate use.                
Works very well for what it is, great value for money. It does everything I'd expect it to and when it breaks i'l buy another one.                
You definitely get a wah sound with this pedal, and the controls do offer tweakability.But the biggest thing that I have against this pedal is the limited range of the wah.HEY BERINGER...MORE RANGE, PLEASE.I consider this an excellent value at 30 bucks.I have used it alone, and in combination with the digital effects on my Beringer GMX212 amp, which is a very cool combination.I also put this behind a Big Muff Pi in the effects chain with good results (be patient and experiment).If I lost it, I'd get another one.Well made and durable.Buy it and you will find a use for it...I did!!!!                
More controls than a plain jane pedal.                
Tweak controls take a little getting used to; more subtle than most pedals.                
Well made, holds up to my big heavy feet.                
It's worth the price I paid for it, and then some.                
I have several Beringer products and so far have never needed support.                
Attractive and sturdy design.                
Even though I will be getting more wah pedals in the future, this one will be used often, and usually in conjunction with other stomp boxes.                
Does not suck tone. Very impressive wah sound with other features that make this pedal worth every penny. The boost is activated with the pedal slightly pressed forward, the wah is activated by pushing the pedal more forward. The range is very limited, but this can be overcome by modifying (voiding warranty) the board attached to the foot pedal inside the unit. This gives it a fuller useful range. The mod makes it a 10.                 
The boost and Q range for tonal quality is a plus for this pedal.                
Same as any other wah pedal - press pedal and it is activated.                
Hard plastic that is sturdy. I have dropped several pedal by Behringer and haven't had any crack or stop working, so I imagine this will apply to this pedal as well. I don't have any backup pedals as these Behringer's seem tank worthy. Remember the old Fisher-Price toys that are made of plastic that your kids couldn't destroy. Well, these can be compared to those toys.                
Best value for any wah pedal! With the boost and Q-settings make this even a better value than any wah pedal.                
I had two of these pedals come in not working properly. Behringer and ZZounds are quick to answer and resolve the problem. I give both a ten(10), very rare these days.                
Excellent addition to my gear. Not sexy, but is a technical marvel. Haven't seen anything else out there like it.                
If stolen I would replace it, I notice that the price is going up.                
pretty good with an ibanez tone blaster                
could have had more, but what was there was good                
i had it running and annihilating in about 5 minutes after i bought the 9-volt battery                
for that cheap it's pretty awesome.                
totally worth the money. if you've got more $$, go with the dunlop crybaby, but if your budget is low, go for it.                
oh yeah. it's awsesome. it looks cool with my black guitar and black amp.                
for beginners, this is a pretty good, non-pricey pedal. reccommended!                
It's great. Some reviews indicate that the pedal is rather subtle, but I find that with a little tweaking it sounds just right.                
It would be nice if it had an integrated PSU/came with a wallwart, but other than that I really don't have any complaints. It's got a Q control to vary the shape of the wah from a more "round" to a "sharp" sound, and a "fine tune" control which apparently adjusts the high end. I'd rather have a pedal that had a click switch to turn on and off; the automatic off feature of this is a bit annoying if it's turned down too short.                
It might take a little bit of tweaking to get the right sound. Once it's set up, though, there's not much to it-put your foot on it and go.                
The plastic construction seemed a little dodgy when I was looking at it, but I don't think it's an issue-there's a thick metal plate on the bottom which should lend support, and the entire pedal feels solid.                
This seems to be the cheapest wah available, but it definitely doesn't sound/feel cheap.                
I haven't had a need to contact the company.                
If price was no issue, I don't know if I'd choose this pedal over any other.                
If it was stolen, I'd buy another.                 
When I first plugged the hb in i was a little dissapointed. But, after just turning a few of the REALLY useful knobs, (Q, range, fine tuning, boost) I got the sound i was really looking for. I have a Jackson dxmg with passive emgs, and a Crate GTD65. I play Metallica!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Guns N Roses, Iron Maiden and this thing works well for solos. For $30, you can't beat it.                
I love the Q control the fine tuning(pretty much presence),  and range. More features than any  other wah i know. You can really fine tune your sound. There is also a boost, it does exactly that, boosts your sound. However, it is NOT an overdrive. It just boosts your sound a little bit like turning  the master volume a quarter inch. can get muddy if all the way up.                 
Pretty easy to use nice knobs for everything. wish the button for the boost was not on the side so you could actually use it live. I love the spring. I also love that you just have to put your foot on it.                
I just got the wah today. There where no loose parts. I was really surprised at the weight and sturdiness of it. It is metal.                
Way cheaper than CryBaby or Vox. Also has great q control that i love. It is not a Crybaby or vox it is unique. And 30 bucks.                
Have never dealt with Behringer. ZZOUNDS IS AMAZING!!! They had it at my door in two days! i ordered ground shipping! Also great order tracking and support.                
Sexy black and steel. Q control. i like it.                
I've been playing for 10 months more than half an hour 7 days a week. I love the price because i'm 13 and can't afford 100 for a wah. I love that i can play the Enter Sandman solo and have it sound good! If it was stolen I'd find the guy and beat him with the wah. if it were stolen i'd buy it again or wait and get the Pod xt live or vox tonelab because i've been wanting to get one of those                
Sound is where the pedal really lacks. First, it adds noise when in the up position (straight guitar). Next, even with straight guitar it changes the tone of the sound, adds a little too much treble. I've tried many settings and configurations and I just can't get it to leave my tone alone. The actual wah effect sounds good.                
Has a ton of options. Not sure they all work exactly as they are supposed to, but it has more options than many pedals on the market. I really like the default to straight guitar feature.                
It's a wah pedal. Pretty easy to use.                
Built well. Has some plastic that may not hold up well if gigging regularly, but due to the tone change I wouldn't even consider this as part of my stage rig.                
$29.99, it's a great value. Perfect pedal for practice.                
I've never had to use Behringer support, but they do offer quite a bit online. Most of their products perform exactly as one would expect for the price being paid.                
Nothing spectacular about it.                
I'll always use this pedal in my practice room at home. I won't ever put it on a stage. Seems to built well enough that I won't ever have to worry about it breaking. I've got other Behringer stuff and it holds up well.                
 This is the same sound you get out of any other wah pedal. It sounds great for rock music, jazz music, country music, or whatever else you may play. The settings can be slightly adjusted to change the boost of sound when using wah or the amount of wah. It sounds great on guitar, and you can play it on bass, but I would recommend a wah pedal made specificully for bass.                
 This product has a couple of features that let you adjust the amount of wah or the sound boost, and also some other stuff. You will really like the spring-back feature and the grip.                
 There is a learnig curve in using this product, but there is going to be a learning curve using all wah pedals. Once you get used to it it will be easy to use, with great playability. If you are playing an uncommon style of music it may be hard to get your specific sound you desire and you will have to rely on your amp.                
 It comes with a nice spring-back feature and sound boost controls. It also comes with other features that can control other aspects like the amount of wah in use. I am confident in it's durability in fact I would be fine with people jumping on it. It is built very well.                
 With the low price and great sound this is a must buy. Do not go and buy a wah pedal for over $100. I wouldn't even buy one over $50 because this sounds exactly the same.                
I have never dealt with this company.                
 This is a just a simple wah pedal. There is nothing really special about it other than it's great price and sound.                
 I am confident that this will be the only wah pedal I will ever buy, until I break this one. Has great features and sound. If this pedal ever breaks, or something, I will get the exact same one due to the great price and sound. It gives me the exact sound I want.                
the sound is perfect.the only thing is the click sound it makes wen u it powers on an off.it sounds awesome on amps 20 watts or higher.it can be used for bass but it doesnt sound that good                
it has a boost button w/ sum volume tone knob like things.it has a range knob which it plays with the tone.                
it can be a pain to use.u cant bring it all the way up cuz itll shut off.it works well with delay and revrb really well(boss pedals the work best).                
evn tho its plastic its vry durable.i would rely on it wit my life it is so good..it would be perfect for any gig                
best wah for the price.it is just like dunlops dimebag crybaby.for evry1 with a small budget an want a wah get this1                
it is perfect for classic rock,metal,u name it.its perfect                
i will use this forever.or until they make another1                
This has a great sound. I use it for a bunch of the solos i do. Sounds a lot like metallica.                 
Everything you need, althogh i dont understand why you need 2 outut switches.                
You just push it down.                 
It broke within a month. Whenever i push it down, it makes a very loud spealing noise, and when its on clean, the sound gets taken way from my guitar even when its not pushed down. Its cheap.                 
Its a good value for as long as it still works.                 
Impossible to find any ansers on the behringher site.                
When i saw it i wanted it but now i wish i had saved up for the crybaby.                 
I need another wah-wah. Its definetely a good thing to have, but there is no way im getting it from behringher.                 
This is a very nice sounding wah pedal. I would even say it is as good as the crybaby sometimes. I played some old 60s Clapton style stuff with it and it sounded spot on!                
It has a fully customizable range and boost features to get the tone your looking for                
I had to monkey with this pedal beacuse it was shipped broken to me, In an idle position, I would not get my regular guitar sound. If you are logical and intuitive, you could fix it. (I did my wedging a piece of wood into the pedal to make it always on XD)                
It broke before it got here... it is a cheap plastic piece of junk. I have never really gone "on the road" at all, so I would not know... The optical eyes was a mistake on Behringer's part.                 
If you want to take the time to mod it to your likeing then it is worth it.                
I didn't have to talk to them at all                
This was my first pedal so I wanted it bad.                
I like this pedal a lot. It's range feature gives you about any tone you want. I know many people think this pedal is junk, but if you want good tone for a cheap price GO FOR IT!!!                
i am almost a professional guitarist and this thing plays better than most wah pedals on the market. it is now my main wah pedal.                
all of the controlls work great and if you happen to break the product its just like $30 so its not too much of a los if you break it.                
the spring is perfect with just enough resistance                
mostly plastic but for the price who can argue?                
its not that good looking but i dont care sound is all i care about                
The Hellbabe is very attractive with its multitude of features at a very competitive price. I liked the switchless operation (but disliked the deactivation timer) and the boost function a lot. I found the sound to be "ok". Not as nice as a Crybaby or a Morley, but it did the job. However, in my experience the sound gets worse with time. After about two months of use, it started to make "popping" sounds when the effect was active, and the wah effect itself was getting less and less pronounced. This is not due to a bad battery; I use a DC adapter with it. I would guess that a capactor has gone bad. This thing is now useless to me. The Hellbabe is also a less than ideal platform for modding, since the electronics are all surface mounted. You would be better off with a low end offering from Dunlop or Morley; at least that would be something that you could mod to be useful.                
This is a pretty awesome sounding pedal - Beats my old Boss V-Wah which was about 4 times as expensive and about 4 times as noisy in use/                
Excellent - tweakable q control, fine tuning and a preset boost with side-switch operation - like the top end Dunlop wahs.                
So easy - any stting sounds good. And it even sounds good with my Jazz Bass, since I can tweak the sound to suit the instrument.                
Here's where it falls down. The casing is solid, the electronics haven't broken, but what has happened is that the pin holding the treadle to the bass falls out when the pedal is used vigorously. And the wah doesn't operate until halfway through it's upward travel. Sort the quality out, Behringer. May have to modify it to suit...                
Come on, you find an optical wah with boost and fine tuning and Q control for this money...                 
Hmmm...                
It's a black wah pedal - not exactly unusual, huh?                
If I can successfully iron out the faults, then I'll be thoroughly impresses. If not, well, I only wasted                 
The sound is good for bass players as you can adjust the frequency affected. The fine tune knob helps dial in the right frequency for your instrument and the Q know adjusts the peak (high peak or more mellow peak)                
There is a boost function in case you need a little more gain, but i don't need that as a bass player. It doesn't use pots, so as it gets old, you won't have a lot of static when you move the pedal.                 
Pretty straight forward, although it takes a little time to find the right sound. the pedal activates once you push it down. One downside to this pedal is that it will deactivate if you leave it up too long, but you can adjust that.                
Metal base and solid plastic body. It feels very reliable and it would be fine for regular use. I don't recommend throwing it down a flight of stairs to test it, but it looks and feels like it could take some abuse.                
This product is definitely a great buy. At $40-50, this product performs very well.                
I haven't dealt with Behringer yet, as the product is working just fine. Zzounds, however, is amazing. I found this product advertized on amazon.com for a cheaper price, and Zzounds were happy to beat it. I got it for $39.54 with free shipping!                
I like how well it worked with my setup (Fender Jazz Bass, Markbass Mini CMD 121p). I have it going through my effects loop and it sounds great! I did laugh, though, when I got home and saw the box it came in. It came in a box that was 2'x1.1' 1"x9". Clearly a giant box for this item, but it was protected well and gave me a good laugh!                
Great Pedal for one who does not wish to pay $80+ for a decent wah!                 
it's quiet normal, but sometimes it starts to crack or something like that                
Many options, but not very usefull                
Quiet easy                
Not very happy, because it's made of plastic and top part of pedal is shaking and I'm afraid it will broke :|                
Product worth its price ! I'm happy about ths pice, because I wanted to try out the Wahs and it had the best price of them all                 
it's normal                
It's not the best wah and it is not very resistance, but if you don't have much money and want to try out the wahs, then it's the best deal !                
I just got this pedal, plugged it in. The sweep is horrible! It also makes a weird popping when you let off the pedal. its not like a normal wah you cant leave it in different positions. It has a spring that disengages the pedal when you lift your foot. I tried adjusting the different controls to get some kind of usable tone but then after playing for like twenty minutes it just stopped working all together. I love Behringer pedals. I know they are cheaply constructed, but this pedal is a joke!                 
Behringer's Hellbabe wah pedal is well-built, sounds gutsy and provides great value. The guitarist in my band uses this as his single pedal wah of choice, especially for its nice price. (he useshis multiple effects Boss ME-50 for his main wah sound, with its excellent and spacey modulation capabilities.) The Hellbabe is similar-sounding to a dunlop wah with a little less grit to its sound. It's not like a Morley wah at all, which I'd like to own for keyboards. I'm purchasing the Hellbabe (and a Behringer reverb machine vintage reverb pedal) with my next $100. If you need a broad or special, sweepable "Q" , then this is't the pedal for you- many of this sort of wah are available- but if you want and need a good, overall wah at a sweet price, then get to know this Babe!

the sound wasn't to bad, it didn't offer enough "tweakability" for me. it made very mild sounds compared to what i wanted it to do. i played with all the knobs i could find and it didn't give me the sound i was really wanting, but at 30 bux it wasn't horrible.                 
features kinda suck, there are alot in terms of what u can look at, but im a man of specific taste when it comes to sound and the features didn't matter because they didn't do enough for me at all. also, i'd like to be able to click the pedal on and off instead of having it be optical. that part kinda sucked cuz of the lag time.                
its pretty simple, there were a few knobs on the side that i thought did very little for the quality of the wah, but it is very straightforward.                
its a 30 dollar berhinger, and u get exactly that. i decided to make a pedal board today and had to take the rubber feet off the bottom of the pedal, the screws holding the feet in were crap. after i finally got the feet off and somehow managed to get the screws back in i saw an adjustment for the bypass delay time or something like that on the back, i decided to give that a shot and see what happened. the damn thing broke off inside the pedal, so i had to unscrew the pedal (the screws now have NO head on them and are completely useless, and the piece to adjust the bypass delay time is done for. i tried fixing it but couldn't get it to work, so now my pedal is stuck with like 3ish seconds of bypass delay time and not even worth the trip to throw it out. i've had other berhinger products and they are very cheap, but they are also very poorly made and almost always of low quality, this pedal was no exception.                 
i owned the pedal for about a year and a half till it did went tits up on me. so if ur on a tight budget and just want a very basic wah pedal this one is a good bet, just don't expect it to hold up forever. but if u aren't worrying about money go with like a morley or the good 'ol crybaby                
haven't had to deal with them directly. i looked around on their website and the way they word their warranty it looks like they don't wanna give up any more services than they absolutely have to.                
its a wah pedal, not to much flair going on. just basic, but it gets the job done                
i think im gunna save up and buy a decent wah, or possibly like the EHX  HOG  that thing is awesome, and incorporated wah, with many other things it can do.                
This pedal has tried to give the user a variety of wah sounds but really fails to give anything that is close to any of the common wah's that we are used to.                 
Plenty of adjustments but they don't really do a whole lot or really help to improve or change the overall sound. Would be better to have less or no features and at least produce ONE good wah effect.                
Read the manual, it's not a supercomputer.                 
The case is sturdy enough for general use. The pin that hold the pedal to the base works loose all the time. The tiny piece of card that moves inside the unit that activates the optical sensor is junk. It has to be cut manually by the user to get the wah to really work properly...that means opening up the unit and using a calculated guess to get it right.                 
I think I paid 29 bucks for mine, now they are 40!! guess if you are really poor you could buy it as a foot exerciser.                 
Never dealt with Behringer.                
It takes up space in my closet, it's a good door stop...too big for a paper weight.                 
Forget it, come on now guys, just pay the extra $30 and at least get a Dunlop Original, it'll give you a real 'wah' and last for donkeys.                  
The boost of this pedal is very nice, could not get the blasted thing to work properly on wah setting, take off your foot, and the effect defaults to regular guitar sound......not good.                
I found the fact that if you take off your foot, it basically defaults to straight guitar was not a good thing. In fact, I tried to adjust that factor outta the mix and just plain gave up on it. Sold it for less than I paid to get something else.                
Maybe it was just me, but I wish I had just paid the extra money and bought a good old Cry baby, now there is a pedal that you can take your foot off, and lo and behold it will play for decades like mine, 30 yrs and still works like a champ, duct tape and all.                
built like a brick outhouse, but if you cannot count on it to work if your foot is off from it, why even worry if it was made outta paper mache?                
My opinion of the pedal is this....buy something else..CRYBABY whatever.                
Here I gotta say that Behringer did do right by me when my GMX212 went belly up. Called em up, and they gave me a shipping number for ups and even shipped me a brand new one the next day. There I would say they went the extra mile. Maybe my pedal was defective. I guess I should have tried...I did not.....not their fault.                
Like kissing your sister.....butt ugly sister at that. EWWWWWWWW! no wait, I like that!not really just fooling.                
I fiddled with it for over a yr and finally gave up.....I am not some brainiac, but I think the instructions are a might hard to cypher.....                
Really great sounding wah!!  Very responsive and dynamic.  It gives you exactly what you want from a wah pedal and much, much more.  The tone is incredible, and almost infinitely tweakable.  You can dial in super clean shimmering high end sweeps, or throaty, vocal classic wah sounds ... the range control allows this to be used with a bass guitar on the lowest setting, which also lends a really off the beaten path "I'm using a bass wha" with my guitar 'whallop' effect.  It's a really fun pedal, because it is  absolutely loaded with features!  The features and dials are pretty straight forward. Spend an hour with this wah and you'll realize you have several different types of classic wah's in one incredibly inexpensive pedal!!  The best part is that it is noiseless - it uses an optical sensor instead of a potentometer -- so good riddance to scratchy, hiss laden garbage in the signal.  The old Crybaby pedal I was using actually picked up am radio broadcast!  I bought this wah in a pinch, because my crybaby pedal is overdue for a pot change-out, and I needed a replacement yesterday, but I couldn't get it to the tech in time -- so I bought this Behringer as a stand in.  I'll still fix the crybaby, but I'm thinking I'll lean on this Behringer wah for a bit yet.  The one major thing that takes some getting used to is the on/bypass feature -- there is no 'toe-forward switch on/bypass'  -- as soon as you touch the pedal, it is on and functioning, which is nice, because you don't have to 'toe-forward' to switch it on or bypass!!  I like that personally and I think it's a great improvement.  BUT ... If you are used to aggressively rocking your wah all the way back -on the default setting, you will notice that the 'heel down' position instantly goes into bypass, and YOU WILL hear a pop!!  There is a delay adjustment that is not obvious but is clearly marked and accessible from the bottom of the pedal ... you can adjust that delay up to two seconds, which allows the pedal to be at full 'heel down' position while playing, and then as soon as you leave it there, it will switch off. I personally like the 'instant on' functionality of this pedal, but it takes learning a little finesse, which is how a wah should actually be used...                
This pedal is loaded with features that pedals costing 8 times as much don't even have!                
I'm giving it an eight, because it takes a slight, very slight learning curve to get used to the way this pedal turns on and off --- we're all so used to 'toe-down' to switch on and off.  If you use the default settings, you simply cannot rock it all the way back without hearing it go in and out of bypass mode . if you use just a little care and finesse, the instant on/off feature will make you wonder why vox and crybaby pedals never evolved ...                 
I really should give an eight, but folks that know behringer pedals know that they use industrial grade plastic instead of metal.  As far as effects pedals made these days go, time will tell... my 'vintage' crybaby wah is mostly pot metal, I could crack it with a ball ping hammer -- the same blow might shatter or bounce off the housing of this Behringer pedal--I don't know haven't tried either .. they hold up just as good as all the other pedals with normal use.                
The absolute bang for the buck!!  It doesn't get much better.  If you don't mind being a pioneer, ignoring all the clap-trap about what vintage pedal this or that guitar god recorded with; back in the day, that was all there was, there wasn't an option -- Behringer just threw it out there, rockstar style!!  Finally, a reliable wah, that you don't have to wince every time you go to step on it wondering what kind of sound you're going to get.                
Haven't had to call them, ever.  And I have mixers, amps, microphones and now effects pedals that haven't given me the slightest problem -- so not having to have contacted customer support ever deserves a 9!                
It's sexy, because it works with no frills and it doesn't come with all the quirks and noise, and constant replacing of pots that the vox and crybaby pedals have.  This is gonna be my wah for a good while yet!!!                  
When the pedal is fully pressed down it gives more of a "rock" sound, sometimes i just play music with the pedal pushed down because the sound quality is better.                
there are different settings, dials, and overdrive                
very easy to use. no trouble setting up or using                
very well made. heavy construction and strong material.                
low price great quality                
Shipping was extremely fast. i was fully satisfied with delivery.                
The pedal itself is a beginner, "must have" sort of thing. Great for beginers                
I belive this product will last years, and keep me rockin on and on                
yeah sounds gud cause i can use it on bass playing and many types of music... i can adjust also the delay of the wah.... i can make fading on the time when i turn on/off the wah....
i can make a very high pitched sound in a slow attacking mode eventhough i dont use s.attack                
there are 3 diff. features in this wah that u can't find with others...
1. boost... u can set the main volume from the wah when ur using it
2. time delay... u can set time or i mean delays on turning it on/off in slower manner or in fastest way
3. range....  u can use it on BASS.... and u can make a very very hi pitch so that u can make ur guitar to cry easily
4. mechanism the spring....it has a spring mechanism which u can also adjust its tension...                
its very handy unlike other wah because it has 9v battery compartment and u can either use the adaptor if u want                
gud quality very eunique style                
very affordable unlike demon wah, morley and cry baby pedal                
yeah they are very friendly and honest especially the behringer people                
i like all of its features                
just buy it and im sure u will not reget                
i would most probly gig with it ................but would not use it for recording ........best thing about this pedal is that u can change the sound/tone .......from muddy to clean babe kills it. another thing if u use a dis pedal its sound differers if u use it before oe after the pedal a lot .................so it depends ............sounds best with out any other pedal.just the babe and the amp .............                 
best thing is the spring back................variation of sound..
and its really friking cheap                
if u have a brin u would know how 2 use it ..........dont worry                 
ahh its preety good.............but if u compare it to a crybaby you would just feel bad ......                
price is the best ever                
never used it ............                
black is black u know but its like plastic with rubber all over it...........so that aint cool .............. looks great .....                
i like it                 
This wah pedal is okay for 30 bucks. Its hard to get a decent wah sound out of it becaue when you step on the pedal it increased the volume so much. If you use reverb with it it sounds okay.                
its a wah pedal                
Easy to use, difficult to get a good sound                
it hasnt broken yet                
dunno                
The sound is Ok. Better after adjusting the settings to my liking. It tone sucks a bit, even when bypassed unless you use high grade cables. Also, be sure not cross audio cables over power cables.                
The boost feature is awesome, just not before the pre-amp input. Put the wah in the FX loop after your gain stages and it will be awesome.                
Instant off rocks and has already changed the way I play certain songs (all for the better). I can slam a unison "wah" note outta nowhere and continue as if nothing strange has happened. The band loves the new places I can input surprises.                
Plastic shell, although it's very heavy. You need to place this pedal just right of your pedal board to make use of the side boost switch. Perhaps the boost switch should have a 1/4" input so you can use an independent switch to activate it.                
Best wah for under $100. Rocktron Black Cat may be better but I haven't tried it yet.                
I own many Behringer units and have asked them for way too much info on every unti and they always deliver. I ask for schematics and mmc commands for each unit and they deliver every time but.....I've never had a device fail so I don't know about support for failures.                
Saving money allows me to buy flowers for "HER" and I feel sexier. But, my wah whines better, sounds better and never accuses me of cheating on her!!                
Best bang for buck!!!!                
The sound was spectacular even before i found my 'signature' tone.
it very sounds classic rock with the gain low. With it higher it sounds modern hard rock. I pair this with a overdrive and get an amazing paul gilbert tone.                 
The gain boost really pulls the distortion together to give it a crunchier tone. The bottom boost also helps add more punch to it.                
Very easy to use. I set up my tone in less than an hour.                
Even though its made of plastic, it is very sturdy and won't give in even under gig situations.                
The best value for a shredders or classic rockers tone.                
I have not had to use them.                
its actually a different color than you would think. I don't want to spoil it. :)                
I expect to use this until it breaks from heavy gigs. then i will buy another one.                
OK, so it's housed in plastic. But unless you're going to drop it from a bridge onto concrete, it'll do the job and stay intact under nomal use, incluidng gigging. For the price, you can buy two and keep one as a spare in your kit. Soundwise, it's amazing and the sustain is unbelievable...without harsh compression involved. This is supposedly a copy of a Boss pedal. The pots on this thing have a nice feel to them, some resistence in turning that makes them feel durable. Altogether, a nice pedal that delivers what it promises: heavy distortion and a lot of control over the tone and color of the sound. The only drawback is getting the top of the pedal off to replace a battery. But if you're going to daisychain it into your board, this is not an issue.                
When comparing  the HD400 to the Ebtech Hum eliminators, this one is the clear winner. The Ebtech cuts the audio signal volume and takes out the highs so badly that I would rather deal with the hum! This unit does a VERY good job at trying to ensure the the audio signal coming in is the same quality and tone as the processed audio signal going out.                
There really aren't any extra features. I wish they had an 8-way rack mountable model.                
No settings required. Just plug it in and you're ready to go.                
Excellent quality.                 
These seem to be cheaper than the competitor.                 
Have not needed to called support. I guess that is a good thing.                
It looks nice. However, when you have 4 or more of these units wired up next to each other, they don't really stack well. Outer surface is slick.                
This unit does the best job at eliminating hum without harming the quality of the signal. Wish they had a rack mountable unit like the ebtech 8 channel.                
Was successful in doing what it is supposed to do.                
Funny. Last year I paid $19.95 for the product. This year it is $29.95. I guess they figured it is worth more since it really works.                
Totally eliminated the hum...and my application is sort of non-standard.  I haven't a CRT monitor and I do a lot of recording.  Well these put out a very large EM field and will caused your pick-ups to pick up a lot of hum...this thing did the trick.                
One feature...it gets rid of the hum, what else do you want?                
Just plug it in and it works.                
It a little tin box....I wouldn't go dropping it on the floor, but I'd say it would survive.                
Half the cost of the others, and it delivers.                
Not on this product, but Behringer make good cheap products.  I own their DUALFEX Pro & PowerPlay Pro.                
It's a box...how sexy can it be?                
Perfect for the application, made good on its promises and solved the hum.                
This little bastard actually works. My sound had a decent amount of AC Hum and this got rid of it ALL. I forget when my damn amp is on now because its so quiet.                
Its 2 channel, 20 bucks, what more do you want?                
Plug in and go.                
Rugged. This is definitely road worthy.                
$20 for no noise...you NEED this.                
I couldn't record without it anymore.                
I am very satisfied with this, I won't be looking for anything else. It kills the noise and doesn't touch my sound.                
This is an affordable isolation unit that will often (but not always) reduce hum.                 
Basic unit, but nice that it has 2 channels.                
plug in cables and go... how easy is that?                
Metal body but lightly built. I would not want to leave this on stage where it might get stepped on.                 
Good value for the price. Does the same job as other units 2x as expensive.                
Overall, this is good value and everyone should probably have one handy. But, it will not solve all hum problems! Really tough cases will require  something like a EHX Humdebugger --but those are more expensive and do affect your sound quality.                
initially it worked fine, it got rid of the static coming from all my ac adapter(don't own a daisy chain). it didn't seem to kill the tone and left things sounding different, but in a good way.                
kills noise, the end.                
plug in, plug out, no power supply needed, completely passive, couldn't ask for more.                
worked fine, but after LITERALLY 3 days it's beginning to make a lot of unwanted buzz.                 
20 bucks, worth it, maybe you'll have better luck thaan me.                
haven't bothered.                
works nice, good price, people should at least try it.                
i wished it didn't crap out on me so quickly, i was getting excited.                
WOW. I have several pairs of low-end professional headphones, and none of them come close to this. As professional as anyone needs. Unless you work in a studio or have money to blow, the sound from these is more than perfect.                
I wish they weren't so loose, and the slider locked in place better. They just don't feel like they are going to stay on my head (but they do).
Best feature on these is the 3.5 adapter it comes with. The larger plug just unscrews, revealing the 3.5 plug, so there is no 3-inch long bulky adapter to deal with when you need to plug it into an amp or computer.                
Fit could be better, but for the price, these are heaven-sent on every other level. Obviously Behringer's low-end, but still higher than most.                
I am just starting a home studio, and if you are doing the same, DO NOT buy anything more expensive than these. They will do everything you need.                
Light-weight plastic construction, unobtrusive adjusting mechanism.                
I was pretty impressed with the sound, very true to the music.  It didn't blow me away, but why spend more if you aren't picky?                
I wish it was 1/8" adaptable to 1/4". It's only 1/4".                
Very impressive construction! Looks are really nice, materials very sturdy.                
GREAT VALUE! These are like, 40$ headphones by my reckoning.                
Looks are very intimidating ;).                
Great product, although the fit on my head was a little wierd, theres a gap between the ear pads and my under-ear.                
Nice flat; not overbassed sound                
Extra pair of slipers would make it 10!                
Pluig it in!!                
Right for price                
Only if I did not ship UPS... different story...                
N/A                
got 4 pairs...                
$$ + quality + sound = 10                
It all depends on what you are listening to and how the sound is mixed. You might add a headphone amp. They sound great!                
It has a 1/4 inch jack and a regular 3.5 jack so yeah...there ya go.                
Just unscrew the 1/4 inch jack to get to the regular one. This is pretty much the only thing you have to figure out about these.                
Very nice!                
You won't find a better set for 16 bucks.                
I saw these on here and was like,"what,16 bucks?" As professional as 16 dollars can buy!                
Overall great for listening but if you are a drummer buy some of those  extreme isolation headphones.                
very good sound, especially for the price
not the greatest, but definitely better than 16$ worth of sound                 
the cable is a decent length, it is probably around 6ft, havent measured
the plug is thick, which is good
it comes with a screw-on 1/4th inch adapter.  the ups about this is that it feels more like there is no adapter when it is screwed on 
the down of this is, it cant be used on other 1/8th inch cables without them having screws on it
its a trs cable if anyone was wondering, not a ts                
very easy to use, except for maybe unscrewing the adapter                
this is probably the only thing im disappointed with
it has cheap plasitc connecting the top to the ear cup, probably going to break easily, and is not very sturdy so be careful
one of the ear cups is slightly slanted on mine                
worth it!!! IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY, a really good way to get those studio headphones when you are just starting out and dont want to dish out too much cash                
N/A                
not exactly the sexiest product but the feel of the cushion ontop is decent                
it was definitely worth the money, a very good value
its a good starter headphone and you should work your way up to more sturdy headphones for those long mixing sessions
it is worth the money, actually more in my opinion                
They sound pretty good to me.  Easily the best sounding $10 headphones anywhere.                 
Pros - 1/8" plug and 1/4" adapter, decent length on the chord
Cons - The cans don't pivot and it is a bit snug on my melon.                  
Plug it in and put it on.  It doesn't get much easier.                  
Quality is good for headphones, phenomenal for ten bucks.                  
Ten clams!  Kick a$$ product for the moolah.                
Haven't needed it.  For ten bucks, I'll buy another pair rather than go through warranty processes.                
Of course, I'd prefer a top-shelf set of phones, but again . . . ten bucks!!!!                
I'll probably buy a couple spares because the value is great.                
excellent sound and durability....if your a dj then you probably go thru headphones like records...but not with these.                
has what every phones have                
if you cant figure these out you shouldnt be holding them                
very durable inside and out                
the best for the money even for $50                
havent dealt with them                
proffessional looking                
its a great product for behringer                
Sound quality isn't good, but I was just looking for something cheap that I can throw on so I won't totally disturb my family.                
It's Behringer....Like  I said, I just needed something CHEAP!!!!!  They don't really fit very snug, but then again...only $10...what do you expect?                 
I think they're worth $10....I don't mix with them, but I wouldn't mix with headphones anyway.                
They look alright I guess                
Sound is not great...but I use them to CHECK my mixes (lowest common denominator).  They don't fit good either...SO WHAT!!!!  They're 10 Bucks!!!!                
I was skeptic at first.. you get what you pay for right?   I bought a couple for throw away studio headphones.. but they work actually pretty good.  A lil on the low end but for $10 you really cant get any better, that I'v found yet!  They can take a high output and high end doesn't crack. Great for when you need multi headphones really fast.
They offer resonably good sound quality, although I don't find the bass to be so clear, and highs don't have a big presence.                
The headphones came with a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter for hooking the cans up to both a mixing board and consumer electronics.
My head is somewhat long (or tall), so the adjustable headband does really help that much, as I keep it fully extended.                
Easy enough to put on and slip off.
Eye glass wearers should not that the pads compress the temples of the frames, which quickly gets uncomfortable.
In general, the top and bottom of the ear pads will kind of stick in to the wearer's head, which also becomes uncomfortable rapidly.                
95% of the set is plastic, although it doesn't feel cheap asto fall apart. Just don't toss them in a bag with other heavy items, and they'll probably last a while.                
Might as well spend a bit more cash and get something more comfortable.                
Never needed it.                
These headphones are resonably uncomfortable, but are good enough for simple use.                
These headphones are great for a tight budget but you get what you pay. the quality is muffled but you get used to it. I would suggest something a little better even if your on a tight budget. They kind of hurt my head too. nice long cable though. Good value but not good headphones                
long cable                
These phones sounds really "dead" compared to my HPS3000's or my AKG K240's or even my Panasonic RP-HT21's (not at all the same kind of headphone, I know). They may claim to have a very flat frequency response, but I don't believe it - the highs and lows are both dead-sounding and I get all mid. Everything sounds muddy in these headphones, even when it sounds crisp on my studio monitors or in my K240's.                
I like the gold-plated dual-purpose plug. Very nice. They are decently comfortable, but not as comfortable as my HPS3000's. They isolate sound decently, but they don't sit flat against my head, which would make them be more isolative.                
I have to play with the EQ to make these listenable.                
For the price, they have the quality I would expect, except for the gold plated dual purpose plug, which I would not expect at this prince point.                
One cannot complain about a pair of $14 headphones when they will serve their intended purpose just fine, which is for studio monitors to wear while recording tracks. I don't need stellar sound quality for that.                
I have no idea. I'd rather buy another pair than deal with any sort of support for this price. They're basically free.                
They're headphones. They work. They don't sound that good. Whatever.                
I will use these until I blow them, which might be forever. I will definitely not mix with them, however.                
The sound of this product is not stellar or is it run of the mill. The description of multipurpose is modest, in that the sound is almost tinny, But i guess for the price they are adequate. But i also own Philips HS500 Behind the Head Sport Lightweight Headphone and they put out a much better quality sound and they were only ten dollars too. So don't buy these headphones for the sound.                
The actual construction of the headphones was superb for the price and the closed ear were excellent.                
Durability and look are high, but the sound leave something to be desired. There are wierd rubber pads just beetween the R and L on each side.                
About the only closed ear headphone for $10.                
Don't know hope i dont have too.                
Kind of funky looking ear cover but overall a sleek looking product for the price.                
I was kind of disatisfied by this product because of the sound but if you want a closed ear headphone for cheap get these.                
Much better than my $100 Sony headphones! These things are a steal. Don't let the low cost fool you.                 
they are very comfortable!!                
Awesome!                
Unreal!                
I own a Behringer mixer and love it. When I read about these headphones I had to have a pair. Just because I knew that they would sound great and I was not disappointed!                 
I'll be satisfied with these headphones for years and plan on buying the dj set.                 
Seems just a tad bit lacking in the bass department.  But they sound better then many of the headphones I've bought at Wal-Mart etc.                
As mentioned, they don't really swivel around any.  While that probably means they are more durable then swivels. (Most of the swivels I've had have broken in the swivel part.)  They can be a bit uncomfortable.  But they fit right over the entire ear which is nice.  
Has the cord connected only on the left side of the headphones.  That's something I always liked in headphones.  They are usually easier to work with that way.                
Seem to be well made.  Mostly made of plastic it seems but definitely not as cheaply made as some headphones I've seen.                
They are worth what you pay for them..  I wouldn't buy them if they where much more expensive though.                
I've never had to deal with the company,                
They look quite nice.  They are silver and black.  But I buy headphones for how they sound and feel not so much how they look.  (I can't see them if they are on my head anyways.)                
Compared to a pair I tried on in a store once these are horribly uncomfortable.  But they are more comfortable then most I've tried.  I would probably buy Sony headphones if I could find them to replace these.                
For a new DJ or someone who doesn't mind a 1/4 jack for there all day use, its a steal and I would recommend all products from them great set.                
no accersories but to be expected by headphones                
Sound was terrible.  Period.                
The earpieces have no swivel to them, in any dimension or direction, so if your ears happen to be in the right place when you spread these junkers open, great, but if not, you're out of luck.                
OK quality, but a terrible product!                
Poor value.  $10 down the drain.                
Not sexy.  Not cool.  Embarrassingly bad product.  Don't be seen with it.                
Sound is kool if you are not trying to mix with them. not as accurate. kinda of bassy. play a song you like through monitors and then listen with these...watch how many instruments and highs disappear.                
1/4 plug is kool.                
plastic. had to give this a 3. THese things worked fine for like a year until I went downstairs while listening to my MP3 player with them and the cord got a little cought on the door knob on the way to the basement. One little snugg of the cord cause the left side to go completely out. I could not believe it. So I could just image if I had a traffic heavy studio with crazy artist using my headphones. They definately would not have lasted. Mine only lasted a year because I only used them every blue moon to track dubbs on some vox.                
good price. I paid 9.99 for mine.                
no need                
dont want it any more. would not by another pair because that small pull caused them not to work anymore.                 
Have to give it a 5 overall. if they worked, i'd give them a 6 sonically.                
Sound good and feel good. You need a head phone amp, low tones will blow these cheap cans out in no time.                
No . Shoud offer a low price amp.Behringer is not a top line product.
It is not if it will break, it is when it will break.                
Simple pluge them in and stick them on your head, any tard can do it.                
Today things are thrown together and thrown out.                
Not bad for the money. My friend is on his second set in 15 weeks.                
They can't help for $ 16.00. No one cares.                
Sex appeal to head phones? A sick thing to ask.                
Satisfied till they start to buzz.                
THE SOUND IS JUST PERFECT  ,, not too bassy / or too brite to fatige your ears after a few hours of playing music ,if you want it loudder or more bassy and briter just crank your mixer to your ears needs and you tell me how your ears will feel after a few hours in the studio                 
the sound is flat and natural and  when i needed to change frequencies on my mixes ,Not a Problem                 
the extendable ear cups are great including the thick soft ear padding you don't need swivel cups, and helps to reduce outside noise , the 1/4" plug is better than the removable tip some headphones have except the screw on type models, we use them almost every day and pull and trip on the wire an drop on floor but guest what ,, still working just like my more expensive headphones                
for this price 3 month ago I ordered 2 just to compare , we try them and later ordered 6 more,today I'm ordering 4 more, go for it                
dont need it                
The silver and black body outstand compared to my all black headphones
the pull in out ear cups , the soft ear cushions , the 1/4" plug is a good design                 
I have many other headphones some are very loud/or too bassy / or too bright ,,,but do you own a pair of professional studio monitors do you know their sound is natural- not like your home sound speaker- can you hear the difference- well dont expect this headphones to sound too brite or too bassy, they sound flat natural for semi professional musical needs, dont compare this with walkman headphones                 
Mushy bass, serious lack of mid and highs. Way too much bass pressure causesall the mids and highs to be lost. I would not recommend these, unless you cannot afford anything else.                
It makes sound, but it is so untrue to life it is sad.  The bass is loud and middy, the highs sound like a poorly boosted EQ, harsh and crisp.  They do not aid in accurate reference at all.                
Includes a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter.  No carrying bag, nothing.                
Plug em in, put them on.                
Light and cheap, feel fake... feel like they could break just sitting on your head.  One small drop could probably be the end of these.  
They do not adjust to your head very well so there is often a gap some place when wearing them unless your head if their perfect shape.
Save the planet and save your money.  Do not support any company that sells such a poor product at any price.  Do not be fooled by some reviews here claiming these are decent studio/music headphones.  They are not even close.  You can get into that range for about $60-70, but even then your still not in the pro series.                
Never used it                
I regret wasting money on them.                
I cannot imagine how they could have touted/advertised these headphone worse.  They are really bad.  Please heed the warnings.                
These get a 10 out 10 in the bang for the BUCK!  Once again Behringer does it again.  You can't match their quality at the price they charge.
You will not find a better pair of headphones under $50.  We'll maybe
a few but you'll be spent just looking for em.                  
The plastic shell is cool and should hold up with normal use and a lil care.                   
Sound seems fine for djing and listening.                
Best feature is that they haven't broken yet.  They are sturdy and both earphones have worked for over a year.                
Definitely nothing to write home about, but it's better than expected for the price.                
Right side went out after a day and the left shortly after. Very disappointing.                
They sound like $18 dollar headphones so dont expect much                
The only cool feature about these headphoens is the cushion on top of your head                
After a week of use, one earphone gave up on me, it just stopped putting out sound, and the other earphone the bass is all distorted now. I wouldnt recommend these headphones for Dj's its cheap and cheap looking, and cheap sound.                 
These headphones sounds pretty good, the bass hits right on , plenty of treble and mids.                
No swivel on the phones, and they dont extend that much.                
I paid 17.88 for mine so i expected nothing fancy                
For 17.88 these headphones sounds great, i would compare them to $50-80 headphones                 
Overall if your a Dj these headphones dont have many features, like adjusting them to your desire. The cups arent that puffy and spongy, and the top head support is a little stiff. For 17.88 these are great headphones, Will upgrade later when I make a little more money                
It's a full sound. Some say too bassy, some say not enough, sounds fine to me but my ears are reference recording ears. It's better than many I've tried for much higher price, although the definition isn't comparable to a Sony MDR $200 pair. For the price they're great.                
They work, that's good enough for me. And the price makes it excellent. No real features, but I don't need anything special for monitoring while I'm singing.                
Put 'em on use 'em. 'Nuff said.                
Still got them after 1 year, so no problem. I use while dubbing vocals and my clients like them too.                
For $10.....say no more. For $17 (latest price) still worth it.                
No experience.                
Sex appeal?.......Do you also vote for the candidate with the brightest teeth? Sorry, a dumb question for a Capricorn, or anyone else actually. It's practical and works well for my applications.                
I would buy another 1 or 2 and probably will.                
Pretty comparable to other pairs around $30 and under. If you need a cheap reference pair, these are nice and cheap.                
Only comes with a 1/4 inch plug. Kind of a pain you'll have to buy a 1/4 to .35mm converter to use with the most common .35mm plug.                
Headphones, how hard can they be?                
For $10 they are actually pretty well built.                
Great pair for the money.                
Have not had to deal with them.                
Some people say they look like a toy, I think the sliver looks sharp.                
Great pair of headphones if your looking in the $40 or under range. Doesn't compare to my $100 Sony MVR set, but these are a steal for $10.                
I use these so that the people I'm recording can hear themselves, so sound quality did not matter too much to me. Which is ok, because these are not amazing sound quality. They're better than any 10 dollar headphones I've heard.                
Absolutely THE WORST adjusting to my head. They are very uncomfortable and there is nothing to do about the discomfort. People have written that you need an average size head and they are wrong, you need a head shaped like a square for these things to fit right.  ALSO the set didnt come with a 1/4 inch adapter! Annoying!                
plug in                
The adjusting pieces DO NOT WORK on ANY of the 4 sets I ordered.                
when i ordered them i thought it was amaizng that a headset like this was for sale for 10 dollars, but then after getting them i understood why they were so cheap. Still good for the price tho, not great.                
Duno                
They look amateur.                
I'm just starting up a small studio to record a couple local bands for cheap so it was nice to get headphones for so cheap so i could spend more money on mics. I bought these knowing that they didnt matter too much so it was nice. DO NOT buy them for casual listening because they are not comfortable enough. I'm wearing them right now and my head kinda hurts.                
I read all the reviews here, and was expecting to be surprised by the value of these headphones.  They're supposed to sound as good as $50 headphones and by some reviews even as good as the $200.  THEY SOUND LIKE $10 HEADPHONES.                
Very limited adjustment.  Make sure your head is AVERAGE sized.                
Cheap plastic.                
$10 is what you get, that's fair.                
They look pretty nice from a distance.                
Don't get these as studio monitor headphones, they'll disappoint you.  And if you're looking for iPod phones, go for something with better BASS.                
the sound i get out of these is equal to/ better then the sound i get out of my behringer monitors, sounds clear enough, not to trebly or bassy.                
these are are alot bigger in person,they fit comfortably but there kinda cheap,goofy,amateurish looking                
perfecto                
the price is rite for light jamming and recording when my folks dont want to hear                 
!!!!                
dunno                
bang for your buck, wooptydoo!                
Low quality headphones. Not suitable for recording or mixing.                
No accessories. Average sized cable.                
Not very adjustable. Don't fit too well.                
Decent Support.                
Good looking phones.                
These headphones sound colored to me. Something about the midrange doesn't sound natural. I gave them some time to break in, but they didn't improve. I'm not impressed. I'm comparing it to headphones by sennheiser, audio technica, and bose, all of which are much more expensive.                
Of course the $10 price doesn't allow them to include much. It does have a padded headband and single side cord, but that's about the end of the features. Notably, the ear cups do not swivel at all and did not fit my head very well.                
For the price, they seem fairly well made. But then if they don't sound good, who cares?                
They're cheap, but they're uncomfortable and don't sound very good. That's not a good value at any price.                
I don't want them. Does anybody want to buy mine?                
I don't recommend them. They are uncomfortable because the ear cups don't swivel, and the something seems off about the midrange.                
As a flat reference for recording, these totally do the job.  I'm amazed with how good a $10 pair of headphones Behringer made.  For $10 studio headphones and home recording purposes, you can't beat this.  For recording purposes, they actually sound better than some of my other $50 - $200 AKG and Sony headphones.                
The headphone adjustment/fit could be better.  It's kinda like your head fits in them or it doesn't.                
Feel adequate for $10.  Maybe a little too much plastic and not enough strength, but the parts used seem to be of decent quality.                
For $10 studio headphones and home recording purposes, you can't beat this.  For recording purposes, they actually sound better than some of my other $50 - $200 AKG and Sony headphones.                
Never dealt with 'em.                
Could swivel and fit better, but, again, for $10, they're great.                
Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
Yes, and infact Ilove it's interior.                 
The headphones give u a feel of warmth and they let you hear your sound if your doing what u think your doing.                
I think the price is perfect.It's the best price on headphones I'v seen online.                
I like the fact that they look brand new. The fact that there big is a good useful accessorie.                
I needed a good quality pair of studio headphones for home studio recording that wouldn't break the bank. These fit the bill! Are there better out there? Yes. And those cost more. I use those other brands in the actual recording studios. These are good enough for home recording demos. I like the sound quality and they fit snug on my head.                
The sound isn't too bad for the cost of this product. There's a deep bass & the highs are there, the midrange sounds a little buried. I bought 2 pairs of these for my home studio. I also purchased a set of Shure 440 studio headphones at the same time. I was able to A/B them & compare their sound listening to a music cd in-store. OK, the Shure set is superior,brighter & flatter sounding & less bassy, ..but the 440's are also much more expensive. For the money the 3000's will do the job. Buying multiple sets of headphones can get pretty expensive...& what if they break?                   
This product comes with a gold plated 1/4 Jack which screws onto the mini.                
I haven't used it for recording yet - but I think these could be good for drummers, bass players (it has much deeper bass than the Shure) & for background vocalists applications.                
The build quality on these seems pretty good, Behringer has a knack for offering a lot at a decent price.                
This was the least expensive set of "Studio" headphones I've ever seen, at the price, it's hard to go wrong, especially if you need a few sets of headphones -- & if they break, well no big deal! They sound better than some other headphones in the price range.                
I've never had to contact Behringer for a replacement product, so I don't know how they are to deal with.                
If you're just starting out & can't afford multiple sets of $100, $200, $300 + headphones, consider these as being decent extras you can pull out  - If you only buy one set of headphones, I'd personally opt for something a little higher in quality...but if all you can afford is $25, these will get you started & I think you'll be pleased, they are also pretty good for listening to music on a home stereo.                
A decent headset for the price point. If you're trying to mix a full production... etc.... dont buy these.                 
These are muddy and muffled, not crisp at all. spend your money on a used pair of AKG's, you'll thank me later!                
high quality? please they are ok atfirst but i have'nt even had them for a month and the right side has went out all i can say about these head phones are you get what you pay for!!!!!!!                
I have those for a lil over 7 months n I only used them twice... Mannnn they sound awful.. My iPod headphones sound 10 times better than those.. They just big for nothing..                
I like the sound for mixingThe cord could be longer & the earphones a bit larger                
These headphones sound great, but they cannot stand to be played loud for any period of time. The right ear is already shorting out, and I've had this pair of headphone for about 1 month.                
Behringer is well-known for bad quality. But usually I don't much trust to the popular belief. Especially because things tend to change over time. However, as it turned out, not in their case.
So, we have a black plastic box with some inputs and outputs, quite bulky, but the iPad in it perfectly charging (wow!) and has protection against accidental disconnection as could happen with the camera connection kit. Synchronization via midi is stable and it supports SysEx - should pay tribute, the device has no worthy competitors at the moment.
But all those shiny benefits defaced by one, not noticeable at first glance detail - unhealthy digital crackling in specific apps.
Behringer iStudio iS202 produces obscene crackling from all of its outputs in most applications where external input is used. Quite shamelessly exudes sonic artifacts in Audiobus, JamUp Pro, Amplitube, Sugar Bytes Turnado, Live Fx, Yellofier, Samplr ... and I'm sure the list of applications is not limited. And this is not just a clipping problem - this crackling audible at the most quiet signal, as well as its complete absence in the input. I was going to use the iPad mainly as an fx-processor, but in this case this is impossible. That noise is also well noticeable in Animoog when notes fade.
I don't know what it is - poorly designed construction, cheap low-quality components, the problem of firmware or all in one. But nothing like this has happened with the iPad itself, nor with other interfaces connected via camera connection kit.
Support tried to assure me that this problem is not common to all devices, and recommended to make the replacement. It's hard to believe after I swapped 3(!) units and each of them had the same problem.
As a result - the time spent on correspondence with tech support, trips to the store for replacement, wasted money and absolute frustration.
For myself I've decided not to deal with Behringer anymore, but I still recommend iStudio iS202 if you have nowhere to put $150 or suddenly need to buy an artsy charger for iPad.                 
It has crackling background noise problem in many apps  - Jamup Pro, Fender amplitube, LiveFx, Turnado,  Samplr, Tape, Audiobus. Bought this to use as a realtime  effects processor, but with such a situation it is not possible                
I snagged one of these in the first round.  I have a lot of things going on right now but my first impression on first tinkering was that I might return it.  HOWEVER... I got a chance to tinker again the other night and I'm happy to say that I am very satisfied with the iStudio now.  I have been mostly using it with Multitrack DAW and there was a bit of a learning curve.  It works well.  You can plug a large diaphragm condenser mic into input one (and power it) a guitar into input two and record or play along with tracks simultaneously.  I'm diggin it.  I would love to try it with Auria but I haven't purchased that app yet.                
What a AWSOME portable daw docking station. It's what you need for on the fly recording. Works great for all you needs. Has lots of option.                
I purchased this because despite some 70/30 reviews on Behringer, I purchased a 24!track mixer a year ago and have been pretty satisfied with it. After approx two weeks, the contact between the iPad and iStudio became unreliable....and a week later, quit working all together. Tried two other people's iPads, and they didn't work either. Going to replace it with the Focusrite                
These go great with the behringer k8...these helped my mixs big time! If u got the k8s or k6. Get this now...and with the 4 easy payments its simple                
sounds big for a small amp. as long as you do't get to loud.                
What other features would you need? The amp has them all.  At this price to have a 5 band EQ and a digital FX is awesome.                
What do you need to figure out? It's a strait forward amp.                
It gets an 7 here, not because of the case, which is beefy, but the knobs.  The knobs have long plastic shafts and are asking to be broken. They should have made them shorter.                  
For the price it can't be beat.                
Dont know.                
I own it.                
I bought this amp to do small gigs, rehursals, jams, etc.  The key word is small.  It is small and light with a big sound.  The volume wont blow you over (45 watts) but that is not what this amp is about.
The FX are a bonus that I would never expect at this price. Remember when a FX processor like this was $400?                
Clear and uncolored running an iPod an a bass through it.  Plenty of volume available.                
Three channels (0ne XLR capable) plus a "CD" input, a sub-woofer output as well as a line out, EQ with feedback detection and so much more for $140.  This thing is loaded for the money and seems to do everything well.                
Excellent for so much stuff being stuffed in one small box.                
It looks good and is nicely finished.  I haven't had it long enough to rate durability, but other Behringer amps I've seen were plenty tough.                
It is $100 less than units from other manufacturers that do less and sound no better.                
No experience with problmes, but the info avialable on their website is pretty good.                
It's an amp in basic black, but the feature set for the price is outstanding.  Flexibility of what you can plug into it is a plus as well.                
Good, flexible, transportable sound at a good price.  Another vendor would have to add features and drop prices to get me to consider them.                
THE SOUND OF THIS AMPLIFIER IS AWESOME, IT HAS A GOOD SOUND QUALITY ESPECIALLY IF YOU CONNECT IT TO A PREMIUM ORGAN OR KEYBOARD, IT HAS DEFINITELY HELPED ME TO FIND THE SOUND THAT IM LOOKING FOR, IM USING IT TO CONNECT TO HAMMOND XK3C AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A LESLIE SPEAKER!!! I LIKE THE EQUALIZER EFFECTS AS YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THE SOUND OUTPUT THAT YOU THINK ITS BEST. FOR THE LOW PRICE, THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME.                
IT INCLUDES POWER AC CORD, THE MOST USEFUL FEATURES ARE THE EQUALIZER SETTINGS AND THE REVERB. ITS VERY USEFUL IF YOU HAVE A KEYBOARD THAT DOESNT HAVE EFFECTS.                
THIS PRODUCT IS SO EASY TO USE, THE HOOK UP IS SO EASY TO SET UP. AND YOU CAN MODIFY YOUR SOUND JUST BY ADJUSTING THE SLIDER FOR EQUALIZER AND REVERB.                
THE PRODUCT HAS A VERY GOOD DESIGN AND BODY, IT HAS COVERED WITH CARPET STYLE MATERIAL AND THE HANDLE IS SO DURABLE, YOU CAN EASILY PUT IT IN YOUR CAR FOR SPECIAL OCCASSIONS OR TO PERFORM IN VARIOUS PLACES.

I pluged my guitar into this amp just for kicks and was surprised seeing i bought it for my drum kit it sounded better than my line 6 guitar amp it has that beutiful tube sound its fun just playing it straight even without effects but of coarse the effects are great too amazing for what i paid                
very easy lots of features                
easy to use                
built like a tank                
for the money its a steal                
havent used them                
this has great sound it hits the highs and lows vary well. its just at high vol. the lows are a little distorted                
it came with a power cord... that is about it. it has 100 diffrent FXs, a nice eq                
the controls are easy. altho u can't use the FXs on the rca input                
vary durable. when i am puting my equipment in my car i am more woried that my amp will dent my car than my amp breaking                
this is the loudest amp for the price                
this is my first amp... for anything i did get a reanable 2 year warrenty for $20                
its big it has a black carpet out side layer... and its awesome to stand on                
this is a great keyboard amp                
I own this amp!used it all the time,I run itin stereo with another amp.I really love this amp,will purchase another one soon ,real quality, looks and sounds great!no issues at all with thisproduct. behringer got a bad rep earlier,but they got it right! buy this you wont be sorry,IF YOU GET FROM ZZOUNDS.THEY ALSO GET IT RIGHT1                
great sound 4 a small power amp.great for gigs!!!                
no problem!!                
easy 2 use. every channel is neatly labeled.                
from behringer!only the best!!!                
very!!!! you know what i mean.

yupp!!!                
great for small priced amps!!!                
sounds great when volume is low, below 1/2 way, any higher a lot of distortion loosing sound clarity                
has some ok effects but so dose the keyboard i use so i don't use them much and came with a power cord                
very easy                
looks good,solid amp lacks loud sound quality                
Only delt with music shop where i purchased it they were a bit slow to respond now out of waranty. They told me to try and blow it up so Beringer would replace it, could not blow it up.                 
looks good, average on sound clarity when loud                
great for a practice amp and a quiet jam at home but lacks the clarity for a loud jam,drums etc.                
 i am pleasently surprised at the features as well as the different sounds this unit produces with an acoustic gibson guitar with a dearmond pickup.   amazing                
I play the guitar and use the Roland GR-55 Guitar Synth.  I got this "PA Amp" because a guitar amp could not handle the wide frequency of highs and lows that come from the GR-55 (which has many keyboard sounds, deep basses and screaming high instruments)  I have played live with this unit without the amp being mic(ed) or a line out being used and it performed wonderful.  I bought a pole stand to put it on and that helps the sound get right at hear level (built in whole for pole like PA speakers).  I talk to Roland Keyboard amp owners and the word is that their tweeters break easily and most have switch to the Behringer now.  They have had theirs for some time and have had no problem with it (unlike the more expensive Rolands)  I LOVE THIS THING!
I use this as a mini PA for solo gigs as well as a keyboard amp, acoustic guitar amp and the occasional bass amp (at moderate volumes). It does a fine job with all these applications. When set on the ground I usually have to roll off some low end and all your instruments have to use their own EQ's and pre-amps because this is (other than the low-imp mic input) a line level only device with only a 5-band graphic EQ to shape the overall tone. If you can live with that compromise this makes a fine little swiss-army knife of an amplifier.                
Sounds good, the digital EFX are nothing special but they are quite useable. The reverbs add a lot to the overall sound when used as a mini PA. The speakers seem matched well to the amplifier, all in all a nice package especially for the money.                
Very EZ to use.                
This seems more solid and reliable than some older Behringer equipment I have used. It's not top-line but it doesn't cost like top-line either. All in all a good value.                
Good "bang-for-the-buck" and very versatile.                
Haven't dealt with the company so it's hard to say.                
It's well designed, compact and fairly lightweight. sounds good too.                
Again, good "bang-for-the-buck" and very versatile. I am a little wary about the reputation that Behringer has gotten for much of their stuff but it seems a good value even after 10 months.                
It seems like the best choice for the needs we had in mind. Just a trio playing in small venues for jazz style ambiance music. Has the volume we need for different size crowds. Still working on using the eq but all I can say now is that I'm very content and the only item that I wish it came with is a cover. Have not had to contact the manufacturer.                
I've only used this unit twice, one at practice and one at show. It fulfilled all I needed to get my sound out for my Yamaha 235 keyboard and Fender Stratacaster alongside my bandmates. So far, just what I was looking for.                
I have the k900fx for five years. Works very well. I use it on pole stand with a Behringer 1202fx beside me providing control and effects, Combo works beautifully. Equalizer on amp works well and 1202fx fine tunes everything. Used to amplify my accordion with dynamic mics during solo gigs. Excellent value and when used for my purposes, compares very favorably with other much more expensive amps. Cabinet is very solid. Controls don't seem to be overly rugged but I have not had any problems at all. Never needed manufacturer support which you require!                
Clean, smooth.                
XLR input is nice. Effects are fun, but probably won't be used that much. Haven't had much use for the feedback eliminator yet.                
Plug it in. Turn it up.                
Solid as a rock so far.                
Absolutely.                
Have had no issues yet. Always had good luck / value w/ Bheringer stuff.                
The EQ knobs have little red LED's. That looks pretty cool.                
It's solid. It's clean. So far has plenty of power, but have not taken it onstage.                
I've always considered Behringer the bottom of the food chain, but WOW, wasI surprised by this amp! I bought it for price point but I'm thrilled with the quality. It sounds AWESOME, I love the 3 channels, I can plug in my guitar and vocal and it's as clear as a bell but it also handles my synth, including low notes without distortion                
Not great, peaked at very low volume levels. It does not work for full-band gigs or anything. DONT BUY FOR BAND PRACTICE. Had no other problems besides volume. Figures that the amp that weighs around 50lbs but has nothing worth while inside.                
Sturdy construction Easy to use*make sure you get a speakon cable or 2I outputting into a Marshall cabAnd have had product for A little over a month now And love it. Very clean soundVERY CLEANNo hissing and thats what I wanted\m/And sidenote i have contacted customer support because I noobed on the speakon cables and they guided me through and got me going no problem!                
ok, so I've seen all the mixed reviews with behringer products but I have had nothing but positive results with them. I purchased this from zZounds about a month ago, needed to power a couple of newly acquired speakers and it works perfect. The unit is solid, quite as far as I am concerned and does what its suppose to. I am sure it will provide me with years of service as it should.                 
I bought this to power a 4x12 cab in my home studio. I'm very happy with it and it does what I need it to do. My only nit is that the fan is a bit louder than what I expected. Not a huge issue for me, but may be for others. I just wouldn't place any sensitive mics near it. As far as Behringer customer support, I wouldn't know...never had to contact them on any of my Behringer products, but can't submit review without a rating.                
I recently purchased this amp, from ZZOUNDS.com, and I am totally satisfied.  First off, let me preface my review by admitting that I am NOT a musician.  I know nothing of the intricacies of perfecting music played through amps, mixers, etc...  However, six months ago I purchased a Yamaha DTXplorer electronic drum kit, also from ZZOUNDS, and I have been trying to teach myself how to play(which has been a lifelong dream).  As a 54 year old wannabe-drummer, I finally spent some cash for an amp, the KT-108.  To be succinct, it sounds fabulous!!!  I had tried to play my set through my Pioneer stereo but to be honest, the speakers couldn't handle the low level bass sounds of the drum kit without becoming very distorted.  With the KT-108, voila!  Problem solved!!!  This amp is great for practicing and has been such a blessing for me to be able to get an idea of how I really sound when I am playing.  The CD/mp3 player input is great.  It's nice to be able to play along to songs(or in my case, TRY to play along).  It's also nice to plug in my headphones to the amp, instead of the outlet on my drum module which will help prolong the life of the module.  My kit is very travel-friendly, so I recently took it to the family reunion, on Father's Day.  Both of my brothers play guitar, the older of the two also plays piano, keyboard, bass and a few more instruments; and my brother-in-law is a legitimate, used-to-be-a-musician drummer, so we kinda had a family boogiefest.  I had not purchased my amp yet, so I used my brother's Peavey 50 watt keyboard amp to play the drums.  They sounded good BUT I think that the drums sound much better when played through the KT-108.  Again, that's one man's opinion but it's mine and I am sticking to it.  Keep in mind, I am not going for volume, I just want quality.  I primarily listen to jazz and smooth jazz music, so I don't the need Led Zeppelin window-shattering volume and power.  Having said that, let me again reiterate that this is a high-quality, outstanding amp.  Many thanks to Behringer for a great product and to ZZOUNDS.com for making it available to folks like me!                  
It has 2 instrument inputs, a CD/mp3 player input, adjustable equalizer and a headphone jack.  What else can you ask for?                
Open the box, read the instructions(not really necessary), plug it in and presto! it's music.                
As I stated before, high quality, no reason to believe that this amp won't last longer than me!  Hey, I am 54, so there you go.                  
Again, I have a severely limited experiential level to draw from but for my money this was a great deal.                
The only support that I have used was totally related to registering my product and that was flawless.                
It's a keyboard amp, so how "sexy" can it be?  It is nice looking, well-designed and very utilitarian.  They also sent me an extra "Behringer" sticker, so I made out like a bandit!                
This amp should last me a lifetime, literally.  I have been very diligent in practicing my drums and maybe at some point in the future if I decided to upgrade to a larger kit, I might consider a bigger amp, but I doubt it.  It's just a great amp for what I need, plain and simply put.                
I ordered this as an amp for my Alesis drums. I am very happy with it. I didn't want to spend the amount they wanted for the Alesis amps, so I ordered this. I sounds great and is plenty loud for me to practice my drums at. Zzound was super fast with my order. This was at my house in 4 days after I ordered. Fantastic.                
I have owened several amplifiers from cheap to quite expensive, and what I wanted was a good amp for practice here at home and for when I play for smaller groups.  Before, I had to take two small amplifiers so I could use an instrument, and a mic.  Now with the unbeliveable low priced KT108, I have good sound on the keyboard, even one of the guitars and a microphone.
Zzounds had by far the best price I had seen on this amplifier, I even saw it listed for more than double the price and I would also have to have paid for shipping as well.                
I was super happy to find this amp had a connection for an instrument and the microphone.                
If you can turn a knob, then you can get good sounds from this amplifier.                
I was impressed by the quality of this amp.  It is actually boxed better than my other more expensive amplifiers.  I don't worry about damage to this cabinet, and I'm sure it will be around longer than I will be.                
Yes                
N/A                
I do not rate things for "sex appeal" and lets face it, an amp is an amp                
Until one of us quits playing.  I have no intention to grow in this field, I'm 66 yrs old, my voice is changing, and playing guitar is becoming more painful for me.                
Good amp that faithfully reproduces the sounds of my accordion even though it`s slightly underpowered. To do it over again I`d go for the next size up but the fact is the KT 108 does what it was intended to do. That is , it`s simply a practice amp and for small areas only.                
None but the supplied hard wired cord is just too short.You will need a good extension cord.                
I`ll be looking for a larger amp soon.                
Over all this amp is very good.My problem is within my choice. I'm a new bass guitar player and have found out that I should have order amp with min 40 watts instead of 15 watts. The 15 watts is ok for home and garage playing. But, overall this amp is good.                
Like many E-drummers I found the selection of dedicated drum amps and monitors to be lacking or underpowered...at least how it relates to my particular setup. Originally I bought a Roland CM-220 amp to pair with my drums but was I always either limited by it's underpowered performance or it's lack of additional inputs for my other kit pieces. Doing a little research I knew this time around I either wanted a keyboard amp or a dedicated PA system, both of which seemed to solve the same problems others were having like mine. I almost purchased a Roland KC-880 but really wanted the stereo signal a little wider than being based in one cabinet. I decided on two of these KXD12's based on gobs of reviews and they did not disappoint. They give me just enough control to shape my sound at all power levels and most importantly I have plenty of inputs for my Octapad, SPD-SX and even my sons can jack in to play along with me on guitars and keyboard. Nothing seems to bother these amps. The build quality is outstanding and the sound is amazing!                
I received my keyboard amp 3 days ago, thanks to zZounds "1 day shipping" deal. I've been running my keyboards through Fender amps, which worked O.K. I unpacked the amp, went over the manual (included), and plugged in my 3 keyboards and WOW !!!! The sound is incredible and the equalizer let me customize the highs and lows. ABSOLUTELY ZERO FEEDBACK OR DISTORTION at low or high volume. With 600 watts of power this amp will be able to hold it's own in concert with any Marshall stack! Great deal on 12 pay as available from the crew at zZounds, as usual.                
Clear and powerful, great for any musical style. Works well in any setting from small venues to outdoor festival stages.                
Every feature on this amp is useful and well thought out.                
It's pretty much a no-brainer to use. Just plug and play. The effects are a simple scroll away.                
It's very sturdy, but lighter than a lot of amps this size. It still has some heft and weight to it so don't expect it to be feather weight.                
This amp is well worth the price. Feature for feature and the sound quality make this one you should put at the top of your list.                
I have not had to contact customer support yet.                
It's an all-in-one package that performs the way you would expect any high end product to preform. The sound is extraordinary.                
I've had this amp for a couple of weeks and in that time have used it for rehearsals,live gigs in clubs and two outdoor festivals. It's an amazing amp with plenty of power, extremely easy to use and has a clean, clear tone that everyone notices. For playing jazz, this amp has all the volume you would ever need on it's own. If you are in a rock band or other fully amplified band it has enough punch for most clubs without having to run it through the PA and for those situations where you do need to run it through a sound system it has a direct out and enough power to be heard as your own monitor over the top of any stage monitor mix. It also has amazing projection that shoots your sound out like a shot gun.The effects are terrific and there are plenty of them to choose from if you want to color your sound, but the bread and butter reverbs that you will probably use most are great and easy to dial in for the room. The graphic EQ helps a lot, particularly if you use any outboard pedals that can drain some of your highs or lows.The low price was an added bonus as this amp pretty much blows away anything else on the market unless you want to go with a 1000 watt PA system set-up. I use three keyboards in my set-up and having four channels available was just what I needed. The ability to add a sub cabinet will be a bonus if you play a lot of low rumbling bass sounds in your show, but this amp on it's own is going to fit most people's needs. I would highly recommend this amp.                
Bought this for my kemper amp and electric acoustic guitars, Very loud and clean sounding, great value for you money. You wont be disappointed.                 
Got tired of lugging around 2 powered speakers on gigs so i decided to buy the kxd15. One of the smartest decisions i made!!!!                
I have two of these controllers. Both have the same date code. One is a fixed installation in our venue, the other in one of those 'gig-rig' cases for small shows.  The fixed installation works flawlessly - after replaceing the pc-style coin cell battery.  The one used for mobile setups isn't holding up quite as well.  I'd buy this again for another fixed install, but I'll find something else for my mobile rig.                
Features are OK.  You'll need a 5-pin to 3-pn XLR converter to use it in the states.  It is rack mountable, and the ears come off and it's still a finished look. We had our repair tech swap the 5-pin XLR out of the fixed unit, using a standard 3-pin mic type XLR for ease of wiring.                
It's very Behringer.  The quality isn't bad, it's just not very 'roadworthy'.                
It's a good product for a fixed install, for the buck it's got ease of programming and Behringer reliability.                
I called the Behringer support number and had the answer I needed in less than 8 minutes.  They seemed to know the OEM battery is weak. ;) They also advised terminating long runs with a resistor.  Yes, it's in the manual, but they wanted to be sure I knew about that.  Nice folks.                
I'll use the ones I already have.                
I think I'll go back to the US dj folks for a more roadworthy piece, but I'll keep the mobile unit to add to the house install.                 
it doesn't produce sound, so... the light control ability is good. many options squezed into a medium/small package.                
like i say, loaded with features. may be to many for typical theater use. but i found the pumping lights to bass/mid/treble and chase sync to tempo/beat to be much fun and not too hard to suss out. two 8-12 light channel scenes can be manually dialed in and crossfaded pretty easily.                 
hard to say, yet - we've used it only 4-5 months. it's held up alright. needed a new battery after 3 months. first fader is loose/cuts in-out (time for contact cleaner). the unit does do what it's supposed to. allot of features we've yet to need, but glad to have - espicially for the price.                
this is behringers secret it seems - made in china, designed in germany (?). it's the way of the future. so as china's manufacturing quality improves - the reliability should as well (and eventually the cost).                 
emailed support and within 3-5 days got a very helpful response. they even shipped me a free eprom firmware/op-system upgrade at no cost. this is a good sign that i can rely on a knowledgable support team even if the unit isn't built like a tank (we don't have a department-of-defense budget).                
it's still "new" - but we're using 3-5 behringer units (DIs, feedback killer, multi-gate) and have been happy so far. if you can spend some time to get to know it's features/interface, you'll like what you can do (i do). i'd still reccomend a more traditional unit for theater if cost isn't an issue. but it's a great little do-all. we were using an american dj dmx controller and it wasn't automatic/easy-to-use and died completly after 2 months (it was also a used purchase) - so this unit has restored some of my faith in dmx.                
It is a light controller, but it uses the audio line out from the mixer to sync the lights to the music.   Im am not quite 100 % happy about how it follows the beat.   Sometimes I have to manually jump through the steps of a chase.   It does not put any noise in the sound system.                
For about $ 200 it has lots of features.   No other company ofers so many channels and programs in a small box and so affordable.                
Now that I play with it a lot it is very easy, but in the beginning I had a hard time learning, because the book is very bad.   I gave up trying to use the book and discovered how to program it on my own.
They really need to rewrite the manual.   I would have loved to see a video on how to program and use it, but Behringer does not offer one.                
No problems at all.   It is built well, and looks very nice.
People complain about the battery, but more than two years have past and the battery is still good.  I had to replace the 5 pin DMX connector with one that has 3 pins, and now I connect it to the dimmer packs with microphone cable.                
Yes, I think it does all I want it to do and has features that others did not offer for same price.                
I sent a few emails asking for more info on how to program the chases but they never answered back.
The book is bad, needs to be rewriten by an English or American born person.  Behringer could make a video demostrating how to program the chases and how to use the conroller.                  
People that came and looked at it were impressed.   It looks great.
Most of them think it costs a lot more than what I paid.                
I have no plans to replace it, but if it is stolen I will buy another one just like this one.                
Behringer has did it again. What and AWSOME machine.                
Umm, it doesnt produce a sound you know.... it does have sound to light features which look interesting, but the chase fader and now the main faders have packed in after only a short use so I can't try anything grrr....                
Lovely looking piece of kit for the money, more features than you'd ever need for one gig, plenty of headroom to experiment with it's features which could cover from Disco sound to light to 24 channel theatre lighting and more.... but three important faders have packed in on mine grrr after only a few hours use                
It can do lots of things, so there's lots to read up on from it's manual. I reckon I could write the manual with better context and grammar. I tried to read it in english while trying to think  like a german engineer! it's got lots of nice little features, that you might not use frequently so forget easily, then you're back in the manual, reading English, thinking in German ^_^                
Looks fab straight out of the box, love it's looks. The case is pretty but lightly built, which is ok if you cherish your stuff and look after it like I try to. It can be cased easily enough to protect it's light build - just dont throw it around un-boxed! I am really cheesed off at the failure of main faders though, the unit is unuseable after only a few hours grrrrrrrrr!!!                
If it worked sweetly I would be over the moon with joy at the price. I love it's looks, I am fascinated by the features it packs, It's well capable of what I need and more, very compact, did I say it looks good? - it does. but..... it's let me down horribly by being faulty after such short use.                
Dunno, not tried them yet cause I am so annoyed and fear I'm going to be "fobbed off" with "you probably didnt do this..." which is my usual experience of customer service departments, but I will have to get in touch I guess or bin the unit.                
I still want it, that's why I considered it carefully before I bought it - but...... (read the rest of this review)                
I have another Behringer product - a Virtualizer, nice kit, again more features than you'd ever need in a practical situation. Again, it's manual is set out really badly and not very friendly. That machine works fine - except when used with computer generated audio, where it suffers terribly from digital noise intereference.                
Yeah loads of features for the money if you can find them.                
Manual is a nghtmare. You get into the bit they're teaching you then  it goes off on a complete tangent without completing the tuition in that area.
I thought it was just me but the manual really is so fragmented.
As has been said it  needs rewriting and a video would be gratefully received.

I purchased this unit here at Zzounds. I am a single vocalist/guitarist and sometimes play with one or two others. My normal venue is a coffee shop. 
This unit provides two independent channels (which can be linked for stereo) so I can put voice on one channel and guitar on the other; this helps performance immensely, because the compression characteristics of voice and instrument are very different. 
The unit has useful (defeatable) automatic functions for attack and release, along with auto knee settings. The peak limiter also has an auto program limiter function. I picked mine up at 3:30 in the afternoon and had it up and running at a job by 5:30. It wasn't yet running optimally, but it was working, making things better. By the next day I had it tweaked to produce maximum benefit.
This unit does two things for me: 1) it makes my amplification system more effective, because the compressed signal comes through with more power at any given amp setting. 2) it allows my music to "sit" above the ambient conversation level of the coffeehouse. Everyone can hear my music, even the softer parts, but the volume is not too high for customers to talk comfortably. Without compression I had to choose between being annoyingly loud or annoyingly inaudible (the quieter parts of the music could not be easily heard by customers.)
The physical build is very high quality, the display is very nice, and the controls are exacting. The de-esser works well, as do the tube simulation and dynamic enhancer. 
The only shortcoming of this unit is the usual Behringer problem: an infuriatingly dense manual that is occasionally incorrect and is always hard to understand. But the unit itself is worth twice the price, and the results exceed expectations. If you are into recording or coffee shops, get this unit!                
I use this tool in my Fred Flintstone studio. I broadcast a music show on SW radio. I needed an up-to-date version for my 1995 "Composer". I couldn't believe the ZZSound price. The audio is alive and clean and much, much louder than the older Composer.                 
I love the limiter action and the DE-esser. There are high frequency restrictions for short wave broadcast and the DE-esser attenuates without being too noticeable, the offending frequencies.                
The 'Composer" is very user friendly, but I felt that the manual's suggestions for settings got me in the ballpark and I proceeded from there.                
It's built like a rock. It should survive in an actual broadcast transmitter enironment very well. Solid metal construction.                
My first Composer was $199.00                
I'll keep this box for quite a while.                
This is a great 2 channel compressor. Buy four, you have 8 for regular size drum kits. It also has a tube button (witch seems to add some 15k highs to brighten your mics a little (especially cheaper ones. Works great.) And also has an enhancer button, witch seems to add a tad of tone (not much really.) Other than that, this compressor is very responsive with little coloration, has a great gate on each channel, along with a rms limiter. I would recommend this to people who need to record drums cheaply, but still need good levels/tone while tracking. You can rely on this for years probably.                
The "adapative" mode makes setting up the system very effective.                
None supplied.  Designed to work into a system.                
I've purchased and used several with my sound system installations. Never a failure.                
Very good value.  Oh, there's better but at considerably more cost.                
Never needed.  Information supplied is very complete                
Good looking compact unit.                
I'll keep using them.                
Of all the things I have done and installed into my system this one piece of hardware has made the most resounding difference. The effects in the Korg 32XD DAW are good, even superlative. However, the compressed signal processing from the Michrophone has annealled the pro sound. It was the one thing needed.                  
This compresser has so many controls it is a little daunting at first, but do what the manual says and some great stuff can happen. I found it relatively easy to use. It looks good. It doesn't heat things up to much and you just half to pay attention to the tweaks that have to be done to get the right nuances.                
The unit is generally a signal processer that once in the line you can forget about it. That is exactly what you need. This gets a great sound. You set it and it does it's job. The price was so good it seems like a good idea to have more than one. Once having used something like this you realize your not gonna get the same control and great sound without it.                 
This unit is made supprizingly well considering it is all steel. This item you can tell is pumped out quick but it does not seem to make a difference. It does what you want it to do. The looks are appropriate. You could give me 1930s English electronics and I would not care. The appearance is just fine.                
DANGTOOTIN GREAT DEAL!!!!! There is no substitute for a good piece of equipment that does what you want it to.                 
Haven't used it. Based on price I don't expect much. Buy another one!!                
It was this component that solidified a real signal processing chain between the recorder and mic. You can't have a weak link in chain.                
This product will be replaced by a new MDX 2600 and maybe a couple more. I want the best too but that is later.                
Still getting familiar with it, but so far we love it.  As good or better than many at twice the price.  De-essing is impressive.                
Actually very easy to use, I am just a slow learner when it comes to new components.                
Again, hard to beat for the money, but also impressive on the features and quality.                
De-essing is surprisingly good.                
I have played with some of the best known compressors in the business... some more expensive than a monthly car payment and I would have to say: Bang for the buck the this comrpessor wins hands donw .. I have the AutoComp 1600 on loan and was impressed on how it handled hard to mix live situations... I plan to get another two channels worth of this particular compressor for my Live/Bass/Studio rig GREAT JOB                
couldnt ask for a prettier set of lights that you could see from across the room to let you know its doing its job .. the brushed steel look with balck face and trim makes it look class act.                
never had to call support... the product is just that good ...                 
'nuf said..                
I iwll be back to get more stuff from that company ...                 
Using the Interactive Knee feature, this thing is invisible!                
It has an AUTO function for the attack and release functions that works very well and eliminates unnecessary knob twisting.                
For the money, this is a good value.  I like how the power supply is built in which means no wall-wart PSU.  The dancing LEDs are beautiful when in use.  The lights are not just for show either.  There are lights that show when the expander/gate, compression interactive knee, de-esser, and peak limiter are active.  The more the lights dance, the better you have it dialed in. The LEDs in the switches are bright, maybe too bright, because some light leaks into the switches that are off and not supposed to be lit.                
I paid just over a hundo (US) including shipping.  I think this unit is an EXCEPTIONAL value.                
So many languages!  If this is your first experience with a dynamics processer, you may be a bit overwhelmed at first.  The manual is bare minimum.                
I bought this unit for recording/broadcasting so I could use my Alesis Nanocompressor elsewhere.  It has met my expectations 110%.  If I could change one thing, I would have phono-plugs for the input/output instead of the 1/4" jacks.  Maybe thats an engineering decision Behringer made because there is another market out there that would be upset without them.                
The sound is very good. No pumping and breathing, no special effects. Does a good job of invisible compression, noise floor elimination and limiting. I noticed no difference with the tube emulator. Stereo couple causes a slight unequal pan out so I dont use that. It is not too hard to tweak each channel to the same settings since the knobs are rotary encoders. Bought this for my analog synthesizer and it does the job quite nicely.                 
the best feature for me is the interactive knee. The unit is easy to use and sounds good. I noticed no difference with the tube emulator. Stereo couple causes a slight unequal pan out so I dont use that. It is not too hard to tweak each channel to the same settings since the knobs are rotary encoders. I very much applaud the lighting. It not only looks cool but it really helps tell you how well you have all the knobs dialed in and they reflects changes in the compression. you can see and hear what you are doing.                 
It is easy to get good compression with this without unwanted effects. The interface is layed out well and it's easy to use. The issue is the manual, which is written poorly. I had to learn compression from various internet articles and then apply them to this compressor and spent a saturday afternoon on it, without too much difficulty.                 
Quite reliable and has a nice brushed steel and black appearance.I use it in a studio only, so no comment on roadworthiness.                  
It is a good, invisible compressor / expander / limiter with interactive knee / invisible compression and lots of dancing lights to help you tweak the knobs at a value price, reliable and does the job. Reccommended.                
never had to contact Behringer. I read behringer products gets mixed reviews but after reading reviews on this product, I ordered it from zzounds and it has not dissapointed. I use it on a regular basis.                
product appeal: price and the knobs and LEDs. I was advised to buy into plug-in VST compressors but I wanted the real thing I could touch, tweak the kobs, see the lights as a new song plays. The black and silver look good.                 
It helped my music by compressing my analog synth nicely and improving the overall level and sound of it. I would replace it.                 
The sound of this thing is real nice. I've only tested it out, I jsut got it so I havent done alot of recording yet. So far, I can see where this piece of equipment can be very useful.                
the features all sounnd really nice. the compressor is good, the limiter is fine, and I'm really enjoying the enhancer feature that brings the brightness of the signal back after compression.                
the manual doesnt give you the best details in the set up as far as giving examples, but I didnt have much of a problem figuring it out. I'm not by far the best with learning new equipment on my own, but if I can do it, any one with any common knowledge can.                
I cant find a flaw. I mean, its not built like a tank, but I dont need a tank in my studio.                 
for the price, you can't beat the quality of this thing. You get more for less.                
I've had a few Behringer products and I've never had the pleasure of dealing with the customer service reps.                
Its way better than not having one. It really dosnt matter what kind of compressor or how much you pay, this kind of electronics is sorta solid and more exspencive stuff dosnt help, its all the same!!                
Really good stuff..took me a few days to get everything down but in the end it all was amazing!                
it was so light when i first picked it up. It was really easy to slap it to a rack mount. I just baught it but if u treat your stuff right it should last no matter what knind u get!
the sound was amazing. Just great                
Look.....u cant get anything cheaper for this stuff. if your paying any more than 190$ for this you can get it cheaper!!                
I actully have called behringer befor and they were quite good. Iv called a few places but nothing as good as BEHRINGER!!                
man....if this was a woman i would have annaliated it!!!                
i dont care what anyone says this product kicks all friggin ass alright. I love it. I baught 3 of them!!!!                
It has no sound which is what it is designed for.                
Nice gate feature in addition to normal compressor features                
Easy to use if you're use to setting up compressors                
I've used Behringer compressors for years without any problems.  Some have written reviews complaining of their failure, but I've never had a problem with one.  In this day and time of cheap production even the "name brands" can have issues.                
For the features in this unit, plus getting four (4) individual compressor channels in 1 unit it is hard to beat for the price.  Several years ago there was an article in a well known music magazine with a major music producer who admitted to using Behringer compressors in his own studio. So...                
Never needed it yet.                
Functional, no sex appeal                
Again, I've used Behringer compressors for years both in live and studio situations without any problems.  Some have knocked them, but it may have been because they really didn't know how to properly set up a compressor.  I would buy one and use the savings to buy better quality microphones which is where the "how good is your sound" starts whether you're live or studio.                
I have been an audio/recording/pro-sound engineer for 30 years. I recently purchased this unit for use in a concert simply to control all the inputs to the board (hint - best live sound compresses/limits EVERY channel). The Multicom has very nice features for the price range. It's not going to compare to a Focusrite or Avalon but you're not paying thousands of dollars either.  If you're a gigging band with your own sound, or have a local rig for your instrument where you submix a feed to the main board, this unit will definitely do the job. May or may not use it in a studio but the features work competently and when we used it in a large stage setting, the people giving us a standing ovation and yelling for more didn't notice the price or brand name of our compressor. Best value for working musicians/bands.                
When it works, it sounds as good as any other compressor or gate I've used                
Great combindation of features for the price                
Bought two units. One had it's CH#3 gate begin sticking a month into use. The second unit developed a problem 2 months later; audio barely audible and distorted. Never had a problem with other Behringer products...very happy with their line. But this model has only been out for a year, I suspect design or mfg quality problems                
This model only....otherwise Behringer products have been a very good value for me                
Forget it.....big company selling products dirt cheap, you'll spend more time and money trying to get it serviced than it's worth. Don't respond to emails...you're pretty much on your own.                
Need to find a replacement now                
items work good when it works. I purchased 2 of these units and both are giving me problems, one has a very bad distortion in all channels and thee other keeps shorting out in channel 2 and 3 giving a extrembly bad distortion sound then chops up the sound. veery disappointed. I quess it true you get what you pay for....                
okay when it works                
easy to use.....                
poorly made product.....                
good price but product is terrible.                
the worse warranty support in the industry. Do not return emails or phone calls. It took severial phone calls and emails in order to get a warranty claim #.                
bad product not happy                 
As a follow up on the warrantee of the MDX4600.  I purchased a competitors compressor to get back in operation quickly.  It took over two months and many phone calls and emails but I DID receive an new as a warrantee exchange.  If a failure occurrs you must be patient.  Buy two of them and keep one as a spare!                
Amazing little instrument. I bought this because I needed a quick way to connect my shock mounted voice mic to a sound card that didn't provide the 48V phantom power needed to run the mic. What I got was incredibly enhanced sound that really extended the feature set of my mic system. 
The warm tones and clean sound alone, make this a great piece of equipment for the money.                
I really like the features of this little device. I can use it with or without the 48V phantom power for my mic, simply by pressing the button. It has a button for 20db boost, and I really like the mechanical (analog) control it gives me outside of my computer sound setup. No mouse needed to set the gain or output.                 
Outstanding quality, build, fit, and finish.                
I would say it's well worth the money. I actually paid list because I needed it, and it's well worth the money.                
Haven't needed the support yet.                
It's not something you might think you want until you have it. It's not a sexy product by looks or specs, but by sound, you can't beat it!                
Don't see trading it, but I might buy more of them.                
Excellent sound quality - using to power a condenser mike and connect to a ham radio.                
It does get quite warm to the touch - I'm going to add a small fan on the outside to aid in venting.                
Well built and small enough to fit in my crowded shelf.                
Does the job as advertised. It provides more than enough gain for any circumstance.                
Nothing spectacular - it just works!                
Overall, very pleased.                
Clear sounding, No real coloring to the sound which is what its suposed to do.
I own a Tube MP(ART). This sounds the exact same.                
More features than my Tube MP. I assume that Behringer Copied the design very closely.
As with most low priced gear its componats could use some upgrading(better tube, ect ect). but these can be done by local shops.                
Good Build, Behringer makes a good product that keeps working and is tough as nails.                
Very Very good value, I plan to get another.                
Five here since I have never in my 5 years of using behringer products had to contact them for support.                
I like the case and the vibe of it. The Chicken head knobs give it a retro vibe.                
I cant realy say how long I would stay satifyed with anything as I like to use multiple brands of simular things as they all sound diferent. So I will say its a good piece that will stay in my collection.
As we can see some people dont know how to use something as simple as a Mic pre.
DOnt listen to their ignorant ramblings. This realy is a great product for a dirt cheap price.                
Swap the tube, it makes a huge difference.  I put in a electro-harmonix 12AX7EH, really improved the sound and reduced hum quite a bit.  Going back to the stock tube would reduce my rating from an 9 to a 7.  I'm going to scrap the stock opamps and go with something a bit more cleaner.  If that works like it did on my 3630 compressor, I would have to change my sound rating to an 11.
The limiter really ruins the sound and keeps me from even thinking of anything higher than an 9.  In fact I'd be really ticked if I couldn't turn it off.  Avoid any setting with the limiter engaged.  It just brings in the mud, wipes out any clarity at all levels. (You should know that this is just about par for any kind of limiter, IMHO, just not normally this bad at really low levels.)                
Its a simple 1 channel preamp, how many features does it need?  What you do get is important though.                
Once again, single channel, gain and level knobs, easy...  Just watch out, you're not using the tube on any modeling setting that doesn't have the "warmth band" beside it.                
Been my first stage preamp, directly after my bass and before my Tech21 SansAmp, for over two years now.  It goes with me on the road, I just toss it in back of the rack with the cables.  Works every time I pull it out.
Great for being able to adjust the level of different basses, even switching to an upright, so I can use one rack with all the rest of my gear without having to change a hundred knobs to get the right sound.  As long as the meter on this is peaking at 0, I know my effects will sound like I want them.
Don't listen to the retard who says the tube isn't hooked up.  It is, just only operational on the models with the "warmth band" next to it.  On neutral its just a transparent buffer/level converter.  Don't believe me?  Take it apart and pull the tube, set the model on "valve".  Any idiot holding the manual could tell you this :)                
Cheap and it works!                
The best support is the kind you never had to use!                
Great size, just wish it had a power switch and mute switch.  Neither of which is a deal breaker and if I needed that bad enough there is enough room to install one myself.  Quick side note: I currently use the "20dB pad" button as some kind of mute when I switch instruments, this works well enough that I have not added a pure mute switch.                
Nice tube tone. Running this for electric guitar. Between external preamp & the guitar amp. Gives the solid state preamp/amp a nice warm tube tone. However, this is not a overdrive box, gives a nice crunch when cranked, but not wat would expect from a tube amp. Set clean, it nicely warms up the input signal into a nice thick glassy tube amp tone.                
Gain, Output, Phase Reverse, etc... Limiter has no controls, only on & off. Not very useful, as it sounds unnatural.                
Well built and sturdy. Not really road worthy, but not designed for that. I was skeptical bout how "good" the stock preamp tube was. It's probably some OEM 12AX7A, labelled Behringer. So I replaced it with a Sovtek 12AX7LPS. Turns out the stock tube sounds much warmer & smoother.                
At that price...                
Never needed to. Haven't own this long enough to warrant it as well. I wasn't happy with one of their products I bought in the past, and the dealers allow for exchange to other products, no questions asked.                
Already own it. Several similar problems on the market, by Art & dbx. Behringer is known to be rip offs, but this time, did Art rip off dbx or vice versa?                
Well worth the money just for guitar alone. Several other good reviews on it running as a mic preamp.                
As a mic pramp it's a bit noisy but actually really sounds good for the price. Remember, it costs less than a hundred bucks! A good pre will set you back a couple of grand!                
It seems to have and do everything that the ART Tube MP Studio V3 has but for less money. I don't own the ART unit but I would assume that their quality would be about the same. I wish it had a power switch though.                
absolutely simple to use. The knobs have a good feel and a cool classic look. Watch your output level, it gets noisy real fast.                
I think you get what you pay for. However I have several other Behringer products that I have been using for over six years without any problems whatsoever. 'Most' of their gear works well. I don't anticipate any difference with this tube pre. I had the luxury of trying a $2000.00 UA 610 pre at the same time and I can tell you that it's worth every penny and more. I plan on getting one. However this little puppy also makes a great stage DI for my acoustic guitar so when I can afford a "real" Mic Pre in my studio this unit will still be paying for itself on stage.                  
It's a  smokin' deal for the price and as long as it holds up' I'll probably buy more as DI units for stage                
I've never had to call for any support for any reason before. So I can't answer. Everything they make, usually come with a fairly comprehensive manual, printed in about 20 languages!                
The knobs sold me in five seconds. The sound actually surprised me instantly and it actaully looks quite nice. I practically bought it before I tried it.                
If it lasts for even a year as a DI box then I will never use a passive DI box again. My studio doubles as a 'mobile unit' and I don't know how I feel about dragging my studio rack around with a mic pre that costs more than my DAW itself. this unit is small, portable, sounds pretty decent and is 'disposable'. Any studio could use a unit like this at some point. The best hundred bucks I spent in a long time!                
Sounds Great! Have used it in multiple locations running into several different systems, always has a consistent sound and makes Vocals sound much, much warmer - it also improves the awful sounding SM58's and other dynamic mic's i have used with it considerably. Used with a low noise condenser like the NT-1A it is phenomenal. It Warms up everything you patch through it. Noiseless - which is a major feature.                
Once again - noiseless - strong construction - especially for the price. If i had to fault it - it would be the limiter, but everything else no problems. The knobs at first feel kind of weak - but after a couple of months that still work perfectly.                 
Seems well made - after 2 months of constant use it is not looking like falling apart or anything like that - still looks brand new and acts like it is the first time out of the box. It does get a little hot once you leave it on for a few hours, but you would expect that considering the tube in the middle of it all. It has taken a few hard knocks and a couple of falls - and has travelled with me a lot, overall very sturdy and still in perfect shape.                
For what it does - i would easily pay triple, and previously did. I have a few other Behringer products i have purchased after this one, and so far the value of all is outstanding.                
Never needed it - doesn't look like i am ever going to.                
The looks are not going to set the world on fire - but the sound sure makes up for it - so that's why i am rating this one 7 - aesthetically it is bland, who knows though - slap some glossy paint on it and it may just get sexy - i doubt it though.                 
At this point if i lost this baby i would definitely replace it. It will most likely always have a place in my setup - for its sheer simplicity alone. I will be supplementing my setup with a multiple input pre-amp in the not too distant future - but i can't see going a day recording without getting some sort of benefit from having this one along. Before i bought this i tried out a couple of other pre-amps - one being the Prosonus TubePre - which 3 times the price - and it went straight back to the store because it was awful sounding and noisy - this little puppy in comparison is a dream come true - noiseless and more sturdy construction.                 
This is the first pre-amp I have owned, and I can say for $30... I am very pleased. Has a nice sound when combined with my condensor.                
Just your basic plug it in and go features. Not many options.                
This is my first ever mic pre so I'm going to give this machine a good grade. It made a difference on the overall warmer presence of the tone. I'd have to say I like it. Bear in mind, I was looking at the price because I've never used one before, too. So, in all I'd say it was worth the effort, the price for the sound improved.                
The Behringher c2 microphone is a sturdy piece of equipment that collects sound well. The Behringher tube ultragain MIC100 was very easy to set up and connect. to my computer. I did wind up purchasing a new usb external sound card because The proprietary one in my pc was insufficient. Both great products and a great price.                
It does add some warmth to the tone. Although I noticed that you will inevitably have some low background hiss. I spent some time adjusting the gain until it wasn't too bad. It does reproduce the sound quite clear however                
Nothing fancy. standard preamp features. gain, phantom power, limiter. pretty basic                
2 knobs and a few buttons. you should be able to figure it out in a few minutes                
I would have given this more than a 6 if it hadn't crapped out on me after just over a year of having it. I thought the tube may have burnt out so I replaced it to no avail. I guess you get what you pay for. Don't expect this product to last forever......you're probably lucky if you get a few years out of it                
I guess the value isn't that bad considering how cheap it is. The sound quality is not that bad either considering it is such an inexpensive unit. So while it was working I was pleased, but don't expect it to last for you cause it's not durable at all                
I wrote some emails and got nothing back                
It's a good paper weight on my desk I guess
also a drink coaster
multiple functions...                
Overall, if you're a solo musician just lookin to throw together a few recordings to see what you sound like, it will do the job. Just remember you're getting what you pay for                
This thing sounds like a toy. Thin, dull, and cheap. I would much prefer an art tube MP or anything for that matter.                
It makes a good drink coaster.                
I suppose it is self explanatory.                
Cheap Chinese junk. I opened it up, and the tube does not even run through the circuitry.                 
For 30 bucks I could build a cheaper one.                
Behringer in general is crappy.                
Heck no! Its an ugly white box and not even rack mountable.                
This thing is a toy. Do not waste your money. It is actually annoying to my ears. Most of the people who have left decent comments  have probably never used anything else.                
First off this is an excellent product and I'm 100% satisfied with it's performance.  I would like to say that changing the tube is a small challenge, but you will more than likely do that if you are into ultra low microphonics and want to go with a lower gain, say a 5751 tube.   I went with the 5751 and although it was a task to change, it was well worth the effort.  I mean, at $99, just the electronics are worth it, nomatter what tube, just that our crew is going for the sweetest sound possible and this unit delivers.                
I was in need of a preamp and I've had experience with Behringer products in the past....did some research and came across this preamp..many folks talk smack about Behringer but I had a combo amp from Behringer and it survived a flood....thus preamp rocks...the three band EQ and built in sonic maximizer are incredible...for the price you can't go wrong...the tube give an extra boom and warmth to my bass....I luv it!!!!                
The sound is quiet enough noise wise, and the gain given is smooth but not ultra punchy.  I used it for vocals mainly and lately on stereo mixdowns, which I'm not totally convinced on the later. On the subject of the tube - it really is only on the post gain that the tube is employed and the yellow light thing that fades in is just a LED. I've never really heard the tube in that regard.                
Using the EQ is do-able but not surgical or invisible.  The variable req low cut is great. A chain I use alot is; channel 1 for gain and pre compressor eq - into a compressor for de-essing and compression - back into channel 2 for re-gaining and EQ to maximize level for soundcard AD. So even if you want you can get a lot of use out of the two parametric EQs for even one vocal mic.                
It takes all sorts of beatings, shipped it overseas and around the place, there was one bit of plastic rattling around in there for a while but I opened it and shook it out.                
I bought it a while ago and now it's cheaper to buy new!                
Sort of over it now but it was the only pre I used for a while, I'm looking for the next step up. I'd still use it on other gear to get more control on synths and the like.                
I've used a few different low priced mic preamps and this one sounds the best by far!  Vocals sound very crisp.  However, when I used unbalanced cables to output to my computer I could hear a very distinct hum that brought the noise floor way up.  Balanced cables never gave me that problem, though.                
The lo cut feature was very useful.                
Amazing!  Really livened up the signal of my lead vocals.                
As far as I can tell this thing is amazing.                
Good stuff.  I've used it for about 9 months now on different gigs and hasn't let me down yet!                
What can I say?                
Haven't needed support.                
This is one fine piece of equipment.  It has really brought out everything that I could hope for in our vocals.  That's all we've used it for so I can't speak for the DI function of using with a line in function.  I would recommend it to anyone that asked.                
Has a nice sound.. makes vocals sound Fuller, and when mixed down, blends in nice with the beat. i have not used it for anything other than a mic preamp.. but once set right makes good sounding, crisp vocals.                
Have not really messed with this yet.. just using it as a mic preamp for now.                
Havent really gone outside of RODE, OR MACKIE.. but i figured ill give this a try because of the price.. for the price.. DEFF! got the best sound. VERY GOOD QUALITY.                
u cant get a nicer mic preamp for this price! great quality for the price.. hit me up if you need a sample of the vocals i get from it.                
havent tryed this yet.                
good additon to the rack.. nice basic. hi-tech look.. good quality, nice style.                
mos deff got the best out of my $$ got it for $120 with shipping, easy setup, great sound. hoping this will be a good additon to studio.                
I own two of these. New, they were very clean, crisp and transparent. Lots of available gain. Solid state with mild tube edge. New, they were great.
On one, with age, a phntom power button fell apart, and the use of the eqs introduces intrusive amounts of noise. 
On the other, all kinds of noise has popped up. Lots of hiss, some hum. If the input gain is minimzed, so is the noise. The output gain is clean. I use these to enhance the limited sound of the wireless instrument capsule mic in my rig. A good pre has proven worthwhile, but the noise level from this one makes it unusable unless a gate is in the loop. I went back to my older one which has only been used for home recording and it has the same amount of noise - and I don't recall it having been that way before.  So...new, 10, but aged, 6, which in a pre, makes it junk.                
It'd be nice if they all worked. Nice metering, phantom power, internal PS, balanced I/O, phase reverse and flexible EQ. EQ in one unit is a no-go. Other unit is clean and works fine. Output stage is good, but input stages are pretty rough.                 
I'd say 10, except that NOW it's a pain to use because I have to play games with gain to minimize noise. I've got something else on order.                
Two units, both mediocre after just over 1 yr of use, and I'm kind to my gear. I like Behringer products, but based on this experience I will not buy another pre from them, including the well-reviewed VX2496. 
Horrid power-off crackle. Also horrid pop with the eq in/out button. You CAN'T switch it live... it's that bad. With gains high, the pots make signal noise.                
Limited vaklue at best. Both units are still clean as line-in DIs. Sound is still good with hotter inputs, like handheld mics. Fine with a gate. I still find the sound very good as long as minimal gain is needed.                
No experience                
Who puts a fakey backlit tube in a plastic window?                
I will not buy another pre from Behringer.                
If you don't need alot of gain, and you don't use the eq, this unit is clean, clean, clean. very breathy, crystal sound, but not harsh...just accurate. Moderate to heavy gain introduces hiss and humm to an unacceptable, i.e., can't use it, level.                
Great features, until they quit. EQ in one is extremely noisey. My other one overheated outdoors and just quits once its warmed up.                 
easy enuf to use, until they develop problems.                
I really reaaly like behringer products. This, however, does not get my vote. Signal POPs loud with eq in/out buttons, 48V buttons, line/mic buttons. One button stopped latching, hardly ever used. Unit is not vented, and self-overheated.                
As a DI its probably great. Inability to hold up is poor.                
replaced with presonus tubepre.                
Sounds OK when not clipping but this unit has insufficient headroom for live performance. Change singers after it is trimmed and you may not like the outcome if the next guy is a little louder. +10dBu is not enough input range. Noise floor is acceptable when used individually but when used in groups the power supply noise is additive being in phase. This can be dealt with by throwing the odd unit out of phase but that is not always practical.                
I originally bought for the DI/splitter function and as front end for Alesis HD24XR. Lots of I/O connections.                
Build quality is actually pretty good but it's apparent the bean counters didn't let Behringer's engineers do what they wanted to do with this unit.                
For rookie sound engineers this will be one of those pieces they are happy with until they get something better and realize the problems they had were not due to them. It's, at best, Ok for home recording but unusable for live unless you know your signal source very, very well.                
Haven't need to deal with this yet. Web site is good.                
Yeah it looks nice. Dig the lit buttons.                
Not quite what I was hoping for. I will dissect one and see if it can be made better but my guess is that will take major surgery. I'm looking forward to buying a trio of octal preamps or design my own to replace these but now I have a better idea what I need. I'm over the "tube" mystique. I need a preamp with at least 16dBu of input capability.                
I bought this so I could record while travelling because bringing my full size interface isn't sensible and this will fit in my guitar case. I will say I'm quite impressed the sound quality and the options. My expectations weren't extremely high, but it actually comes very close to the quality I get out of my much more expensive full size interface.The preamp options are also excellent, the Valve setting really warms up the sound of direct guitar and I think I will be able to get better than demo quality recordings with it. I haven't put it through it's paces on vocals yet but I think it will replace my other interface for guitar tracking. For $60 it really is a good buy and zZounds was super fast with the shipping                
This Mix 800 is great. Sounds better than my Voco Pro 890 karaoke machine. The Mix 800 has both reverb and echo, the 890 only has echo. Plus the unit is small, which is a plus. Voice canceler is not something I use. Own four Behringer MX8500 mics and this unit is great using the mics. Compliments my home Karaoke system.                
This product does not do anything it says it will do. The only thing it cancels is the music.                
this mixer/canceler is suited for kids/novelty use at best. When you activate the voice cancel feature the music source becomes very muffled and difficult to modulate. But then again for the price it is what it is, a low priced item with quality and performance to match. If you are looking for a crystal clear sound with voice track removed, this is not what you are looking for.                
wasn't expecting much for $150.00. I was very much surprised when I hooked it up to my jbl and cube monitors and my akg q701 cans. the sound is very quiet and true, its well built and the " big knob" feels like the real deal and everybody loves big knobs!                
What a great midi controller, this works great live or in the studio. Can you find another keyboard with motorized faders at this price? I don't think so! It works with several of the top DAW's out there. You won;t be disappointed with this one!                 
The Behringer Europort MPA40BT  is a great all in one Battery Powered PA for less than 180.00 on the street. Two channels line in or XLR.  Bluetooth and USB Digital 2 Mic Capability.  Power for 8hrs. It solves a problem for the gigging musician who has paying gigs for 50-150 people but dose not need the power a DJ would need for a dance floor party.  So many gigs just need some general power to amplify for a small group.  This is an easy set up and makes for a nice gig paying 175.00-300.00 and in a park or backyard.  Just grab your guitar the Europort MPA40BT and maybe a mic or a few battery powered effects and You good to go.  I could see busking with this too in NYC.  The Bluetooth feature let's you stream from your iPhone or Android device.  I've used it with my Andy Culpepper Spruce Blanca with a LR Baggs Dual Source and my Cordoba GKSL with a Fishman Presus Blend.  Both sound great.  Thank you Michael Perez for sharing the information on the Behringer Europort MPA40BT with me.  
I am 100% satisfied with this speaker use it for wedding ceremonies as well as outback of my house and small parties. More than loud enough I haven't even come close to pushing it. The battery life is as advertised. Works better as a line in bit the Bluetooth is fun and easy when sound quality is not as important.                
So, here first the info the I was looking for when I was shopping for battery powered amps before: I used the MPA40BT with two Channels, at more than 50% Volume with a microphone on channel 1, Guitar on channel 2 for 8 hours straight outside playing music, and the battery indicator was still yellow, which should be about 50% power remaining. So I believe the 12 hour power claim. I am pleasantly surprised that it sounds very good. The drawback is so far only that the guitar fades very strongly when you sing. Otherwise this amp has exceeded my previous expectations. It is loud enough to play in the Street and be heard nicely. Mic Sound is great, a build in reverb would be an additional great feature, since I am working entirely battery powered. The Pro handle works great as well. Put a bag on top of the amp and your cart is ready to be pulled to the gig. The Bluetooth sounds great as well. I loaded some Karaoke tracks on my phone and they worked great as backing tracks. Paired the amp with the push of one button. Easy. I think I chose the right amp for busking.  I had no contact with the Manufacturer, but I am required to rate it ???. Well, I put five stars just hoping that Behringer will offer great support in case something should go wrong.  I will keep you posted since I used the Amp only several time so far, but under serious work conditions. If there should be a problem later, I will update this review. Thanks.                
Recently purchased this item after trying out the Roland Street Cube EX.  Although the Street Cube has a lot more to offer as far as Effects, it can't compare to the power and sound of the Behringer MPA40BT-Pro with Bluetooth!!!  The Behringer has more low end and full range sound and is louder than the Roland for 1/3rd the price!  Now the Roland offers 4 inputs, but the Behringer MPA40-BT has 4 also.  2 Hi Z inputs and or Low Z inputs.  3rd channel is Bluetooth wireless, and 4th is RCA.  For my situation, We only needed two.  Don't get me wrong, Roland Street Cube is a very well made and well thought out unit, but for 1/3rd the price and better sound and louder over all projection, the Behringer MPA40BT-Pro works better!                
Sound response for mic'ed actors was exceptional using Shure BLX body mics. They also sound great for karaoke with the cheap, tried-and-true Nady DKW Duo. I also tested them wirelessly with an Akai EWI5000, and the sound was clean, pure, and LOUD. As you would expect for speakers of this size, they're a little light on bass, but even at that, the bass was far better than I expected it to be.                
Take your pick. 12+ hours of battery life, Bluetooth, sound quality, multiple inputs, independent level controls for each input, handy wheels and extending handle.                
They worked flawlessly and easily right out of the box.                
Build quality seems very solid, but only time will tell. My only complaint about the build is that the plastic of the outer housing is a little slick and doesn't want to hold onto the stick-on velcro pads I put there for the wireless receivers and external batteries to go with them. I solved that problem with a little bit of Gorilla Glue.                
You can't get a better battery powered Bluetooth speaker for the money, and you can't even get CLOSE to a battery powered DJ speaker of this quality for the money.                
I have not needed support for these speakers, but I've dealt with Behringer before, and they've always provided good warranty service.                
People loved these speakers at the show we did this week. They were amazed that not only was the sound exceptional, the speakers were completely wireless and mobile.                
I had a specific plan in mind when I bought them, and they surpassed my expectations, so I wanted to share it here.First thing, I want to address the battery issues some people have reported on other reviews. Mine have worked flawlessly in their first real world outing. I used these speakers for the past week as satellite speakers for mic'ed actors in a Shakespeare production. After every three hour performance, they still showed 4 bars of battery. We recharged them every night just in case, but we wouldn't have needed to. If you get these speakers and have battery issues, my advice would be to contact Behringer for warranty. I've used Behringer products for years as a mobile DJ and as a theatre sound technician, and their customer and warranty service has always been exceptional.Second, I want to talk about something else people have complained about. These speakers do not have an "out" connection. That does NOT mean you can't use two of them in stereo, wirelessly, you just need to put a little ingenuity and investment into it. I already had an Alto Stealth wireless audio transmitter/receiver system. The thing about the wireless system is that the receivers run on very little power. So little that, with the purchase of a $10 5v to 12v USB boost adapter, you can run the receivers off an external cell phone battery. I purchased a pair of 16750 mAh batteries to go along with them, and a pair of boost adapters. Now these speakers are 100% wireless without the signal delay you often get from Bluetooth. I attached the batteries and receivers to the sides of the speakers with velcro. This worked flawlessly, every single night. So I can put these speakers anywhere, in stereo or mono, in pairs or one at a time, without having to run a single cable for audio OR power.These speakers are LOUD, much louder than you'd expect, with decent bass for their size. You wouldn't want to run them in a night club without a subwoofer, but for your average quick-setup small to medium karaoke night these are going to be fantastic. I will be using them in a 220 seat theatre for karaoke night at the end of the month, and I don't expect to have any issue at all with filling the room with sound. Granted, it's a theatre, not a football stadium, so your mileage may vary.I also tested one of these out by itself as the speaker for an Akai EWI 5000 wind synthesizer, and the sound is incredible. The battery system I described above also is more than enough to power the EWI wireless receiver. That means that these speakers are almost ideal for busking with an EWI. With a decent mic plugged in, and an acoustic-electric guitar, I also think they would be fantastic for small acoustic gigs.Do NOT use the mic that comes with the speaker! It's barely a toy. Get yourself at the very least a Nady Starpower or a Behringer Ultravoice on the low end, or invest in a decent Shure PG or SM58 (go with the SM if you can spare the extra $40).The Bluetooth on these speakers is as easy to connect as any, and the sound quality is as excellent as any other connection. The only reason I don't use Bluetooth for gigging is you can't sync two speakers together, and because there's enough of a delay in signal to make it useless for karaoke or live music. But if you're just going to be playing music from your phone, computer, or tablet, you cannot get a better battery powered speaker for the price.Granted, I've only tested these speakers real-world for a week, but if they keep working as well as they have been, I have no doubt they'll be my go-to speakers for most applications outside of large weddings or night club gigs. They're worth every penny I've put into them.                
I bought this speaker not knowing too much about it , I bought it for my son to use it for his marching band at his HS ...for practice they needed something that would be portable , well it is great , the batteries last 12-15 hours at least !  and I used it last Saturday for a wedding ceremony outside and it worked outstanding !! Now I wouldny DJ with this speaker but I would take it to the park , beach or wherever and listen to my music in a very very respectable nice sound .    Yes  I would recommend this speaker .. 
Bluetooth works easily and flawlessly.  Great sound and plenty of it for what it is. Battery lasts hours. I use it for outdoor wedding intro and recession music.                 
This little speaker can put out some amazing sound. I only found one small issue with this bad boy. I do not know how strong a Bluetooth signal can be, but whenever I use it in my house and walk to other rooms ( phone in pocket ) the sound becomes intermittent, I guess the walls hinder the signal. However, it has good range in open areas, or outdoors. Might be prudent to purchase a PA tripod stand, it projects the sound 10 fold as opposed to having it on the floor/ground. I use this thing a lot and has good battery life before having to charge it.                 
I am impressed with this PA. The sound quality is great. The Bluetooth works great and we are able to use this in different places we sing. This will be especially good for our Easter Sunrise service and later, the Memorial Day service, both which are held in the local cemetery where there is no power. The battery is strong enough to handle all the sounds. We have tried some higher priced karaoke machines but they lacked quality. This machine did not let us down. We also bought a wireless mic which made it even better.                
This 8-inch 40-watt speaker has an amazing sound and functionality for a battery-powered unit.  At 20 lbs., it's perfect for music and sound reinforcement at a beach wedding.  I just carry the speaker, stand, and laptop to the sand, power on and start the prelude music.                
The Behringer MS16 Active Personal Monitor is a great set of powered speaker.                
It comes ready to use, right out of the box.                
Very easy to use.
Great  for home, office, desk and laptop.
I use this set of speakers to mix the tracks that I record on my Tascam DP-008. They are excelent monitors for home studio.                
Behringer makes excellent products.
Excellent sound and controls
The MS16 is one of them.
I am very happy with Behringer products.                
The price of the Behringer MS16 is the best one on the market.
About five years ago I bought the same kind of monitor made by Roland (the MA-8)and the price was way higher than the actual price of the Behringer MS16.
All the products that I have from Behringer work very well.
So far, I have not used the support yet.                
I just needed a pair of monitor for my home studio                
The MS16 is a great set of speakers with  excellent sound quality, and I expect to use this pair of monitor for some years to come.                
The sound is pretty good.  Keep in mind these are "budget" monitors, and for $60.00 they're well worth it.  My only complaint about them is how they handle low frequencies.  I have to back off on the bass when I'm using my synths.  However, when using my Fostex digital 8 track (MR-8B) they sound quite nice!                
I'm going to give features a 10 for several reasons.  My (10) rating is based on what all they included on these speakers for under $60. You get bass and treble control, there is a 1/4 mic jack on the front--with its own volume control, and on the rear there are two more sets of inputs.  One being RCA, and the other one is a 1/8 jack.  You can have three connections to these speakers at one time.  Plus the size of the monitors allows them to set nicely into a desktop setup without taking much space.
Also keep in mind that these monitors aren't "new" per say.  These particular monitors are actually the old "Roland Micro Monitors" with the Behringer name.  They're the exact same thing.                 
Very easy to use.  There's nothing to them.  Plug them into the wall, connect your gear, and push the power button :)                
Quality is very good for the price range.  Again, lower frequencies (when using keyboards) can cause distortion.                
For less than $60 truely a "great value".  They're worth every penny.  Even if you don't do studio work, these would make a great substitute for cheap (good sounding) computer speakers, or anything you want to hook up to them (ipods, CD players, ect).                
I've contacted them regarding other products and service was always good.                
Great sex appeal...:)  They got a clean design to them, and just looking at them you can't help but think-- "Hmmmmmm how do those puppies sound?"                
I plan on being satisfied with them as long as they "continue to work".  When they break--then I'll be unsatisfied.  If they broke today I'd buy another pair.  For the price you can't go wrong.  Well worth it.                
Very big sound.  I was highly impressed.  My one gripe is they are very "heavy" sounding.  The low frequencies are most prominent when used with the bass and treble knobs at a flat response.  You can adjust them manually but I would like them to be a bit more flat sounding.  For 60 bucks, I am not complaining.  I will admit, this is the weakest link in my chain, but if you can make your mix sound good on these, trust me, it will sound good anywhere.                
For what they are they work good. We use them for non-linear editing system. They are better than computer speakers, better built, not hi-fidelity. We looked at some of the more expensive ones that sounded a little better but for three times the price I thought whatever. We bought the MS16's                
Good features for the money                
Easy to use. Everything's labeled on the speaker.                
Good value for the money. They're cheap, but well worth $70                
Good bang for the buck.                
No                
Basic                
Hope it lasts several years                
Sound is terrific to me gotta love them.. you can really hear everything. No hiss in less you turn the treble up all the way then you hear a little bit.. Beats the hell out of computer speakers!                
they are ok really wish they had 1/8 jacks so i plug directly into my interface as 1/8 instead of quarter inch..                
Its made pretty cheap what do you expect your only paying like 60 bucks so.. What more can you expect?                
Dont need none just hook her up correctly and you will be listing in no time=]                
not very sexy looking lol but the def get the job done. they really look like some speakers you would up to a regular stereo                
These monitors are probably the single worst investment I've made of any sort yet this new year. One person claimed they had too much bass, but when he plugged the ports it tightened them up. What these have, in my opinion, is a boomy replica of bass reproduction, but not actual bass. Effectively they're just a couple of tin cans that I'd return if it were worth the hassle. I'll just Craig's List 'em, take the hit and get rid of them.                
Basic; nothing more.                
I give them a (4) on this count because you have to spend an incredible amount of time trying to position them to sound well, only to find that it can't happen.                
Nothing special, but not defective at any rate.                
Total waste of money even if they were ten bucks!                
No idea.                
"I want them gone"                
They stink, basically.                
Sounds are hissing and at very low volume. All the buttons function as they should,,,, bass is very hard to hear not matter the volume. I would not buy again!! I am currently looking to Bose for their companion 3 sepakers.                
No                
Whats to learn? Plug the cord into the wall, the wall into the unit plug speaker jack into speaker and there you go. Concentrate on well built sounding product and ease will come.                
No                
Dont know have not used them                
weak.....weak.....weak!!                
hate it wish I had not bought it. Looking now for a replacement.                
You reallu cant expect the best quality.......however the sound overall is good and you basically get what you want of it                
I Must say that i am quite impressed with the features this lil thing has                
Very Very easy to use                 
Yes "this" product could'nt have been made better                   
Cant get smthng better fot the price                 
never had to deal with the company however the local music shop from where i got this were supportive                 
Quite impressive                 
As long as it lasts happily singing out beautiful tunes                 
sounds very good even at higher volumes. i use it for recording or playing backing tracks while playing thru my amp. when cranked too loaud there is some distortion but at levels just loud enough to compete with my amp levels in my house it sounds pretty good.                
if you cant figure out how to use speakers you probably cant read this review anyway                
seems to be good quality, the logos are cheesy but that is just personal preference                
cant beat the these for 65 bucks reconditioned. they looked brand new                
never used it                
really great speakers for what i do. at the levels i usually use in my house they sound really great. when you factor in the price they really cant be beat                
You get what you pay for.  These are more like mid-range computer speakers than audio monitors.  They do that duty fine.  But they are not for mixing or critical listening.  Bass is weak (I'm not looking for big bass, just a somewhat flat frequency response down to 90 Hz or so, and these definitely don't have that) and they rattle like mad at certain frequencies.                
Well, they're really cheap, so even if they don't sound good, you can use them for plenty of applications other than mixing and critical listening.                
They didn't seem to care that I was really displeased and wouldn't consider an exchange of some sort or some kind of credit.                
 Perfect sound production which you can never imagine Behringer can get this far. Hell with other BIG BRANDS when you can save hundreds and thousands by not looking at brands but listening..truthfully/.                
Best of the best                
Best                
Excellent                
No doubt i want.                
Listen and not look. MS16 is the truth to monitoring your production.                
They get excellent sound from these speakers, for the price you can't beat it $59.00 is worth every penny, I'm using these speakers w/ my  cry baby 535Q wah & my zoom GFX-8 pedal lines run straight out of the GFX-8 L/R jacks into the L/R RCA's & it makes these speakers sound like a full blown stack even at loud levels I thought they would distort like crazy once I turned them up I was wrong it sounded even better like an amp being turned up with plenty of practice volume also can pacth my sound into the mixer w/ the supplied cable & record my sound I hardly use my amp after buying these                 
no                
This is worth every penny & I wouls replace it if it stays the same price you can't go wrong for the price of these speakers                
The stereo separation is excellent. I've still not tried turning the volume higher than 5. At that volume, there was no audible distortion. This is something that separates these speakers from others I've used. I'm so impressed. I would recommend setting the treble to 4 and the bass to 3.                
The mixing features look to be quite useful, but at this point, I have only used the Digital -in (spdif) - which is a feature I love.                
If you're using spdif, make sure to switch to it, as the default on my speakers was optical. Very easy to setup.                
Excellent quality. I was really surprised.                
I think these speakers are worth much more than what they sell for. If I had known how good they'd be, I would have bought them years ago.                
Have not had to contact them                
These are nice looking speakers. They look like near field speakers that cost hundreds more.                
I've wanted these speakers for years. The idea of being able to use spdif from my sound card directly to speakers always seemed like a great idea, so I finally bought them. When I took them out of the box I was surprised at how solid they were. Hooking them up was a snap, and when I turned them on and slowly turned up the sound, I was totally amazed. Beautiful full spectrum sound! Even at 20 watts, the volume at 2 is plenty at night and is full and convincing even at such a low setting. It's true that the sound is a bit tinny unless you add some bass.                
Very detailed, superb sound for such small monitors. I found both highs and lows adequate for the purpose - you are not trying to shake the walls of your house and make your neighbors aware of your new sound system. It is a pair of NEAR FIELD monitors and they do what they are designed to do perfectly. Some users may not fully enjoy these classy speakers because of the inferior analog output of the computer and cheap wires. Also, if you are listening to a low-quality MP3 files with bit rates lower than 192kb or such, you'll hear all the sound compression defects - do not blame your speakers then!                
Volume and bass- treble controls come in handy.                
This 100$ product as well as similar Maudio monitors is way way better then anything that you can buy for your computer in a Circuit City within 400$                
I am not a professional, nor even a particularly advanced amateur, so I may not be the most reliable witness if you want to know about the accuracy of these monitors.  That said, I like them very much.  They seem well built.  The construction is solid and the knobs are smooth and well dampened.
There is a slight hiss, but at a normal distance it is indiscernible unless you have a dead silent room.  If this is a serious problem for you, you probably won't find what you need in this price range.
I have found the 20W to be plenty of power.  They would easily fill a large room.                
These monitors seem to pump out too much bass when the EQ's are set to default. I guess if you listen to hip-hop that is ideal. I usually have the bass knob at about 10 o'clock, and the treble knob at about 2. Otherwise they are loud enough for 10 watts each. They sound awesome when I play my keyboard through them, especially piano. They have a good range, and definitely plenty of bass.                 
I know I should give it a 10, but it doesn't have mid-range EQ's. I realize it's only $100, but that would have been nice. I like the SPDIF ins and outs, and having 2 inputs is a plus. They don't cause a noticeable interference if you place them within a reasonable distance from your computer monitor. Mine are about 3 to 4 inches away on either side.                
How hard is it to adjust volume, bass and treble?                
These things seem heavy duty. I'm sure they will last longer than I have a need for them.                
I'm loyal to Behringer products because of their quality and value, so for the price I don't know if these can be beat.                
I haven't needed to contact them.                
Out of all the studio monitors in this range, I personally think these look a LOT better than any others. I like the sleek black with the white ring around the cone of the bass speakers. It makes my home studio look that much more professional, whereas some others look cheap and child-like.                
I cannot compare these to other monitors in this range, but I am more than satisfied with the quality, and I will only upgrade when I need more volume and more accurate sound reproduction from professional studio monitors.                
Crisp, well defined sound for such small, self-amplified, speakers. I bought them to replace some older stand-alone computer speakers and the Behringer MS20 are so much better.  A perfect match for my home computer set up with limited desk space.                
I've yet to purchase an optical digital cable.  So far I've only used RCA analog cables and the unit sounds great.                
There wasn't much of a learning curve. For me, the ability to instantly adjust the bass and treble are the major benefit.  I can quickly adjust the speaker from voice only or internet radio live stream to DVD movies or CD audio. Living in a small apartment, I do use the front head phone jack, which is well placed for my use.                
Speaker cabinets are made of dense MDF wood rather than plastic.                  
Everything seems to be well made for this price point.                
My PC, keyboad, mouse and monitor are black.  So, the speaker cabinets look great.                  
The sound of these speakers is great. Very clear and allot of seperation. the are the clearest pair of speakers I have. They shoould be they are reference monitors.                
Digital in and analog in are great.Each with it's own volume knob. perfect                
They are speakers. Plug in and go                
Very nice enclosures. Speakers are well made.                 
Can't beat the price on these.                
I don't know. Never had to contact Behringer on any of the products I own. That's great!                
I want it? I have em. Nuff said                
I bought these for my home studio. I needed clear audio for recording. These are great. The bass sound and tweets are great. I recommend these to anyone looking for good near field's.                
for its size and price, i think these are awesome reference speakers. they might be a little small sounding but they have a flat response for critical mixing.                
Better than I expected - 5.0                
More than I need - 5.0
Plug and play - 5.0                
Good, solid construction - 5.0                
Excellent - 5.0                
Have not needed - 5.0                
They look impressive on the desk - 5.0                
I have had powered monitor speakers on my "someday" list for years. I use headphones while I do my audio work, but I sometimes need to play my results for others. I have my computer hooked into my component stereo for when I need to do that. But I have always hoped to some day have a nice pair of powered computer monitors. Of course I've used the cheap ones that sound, well, cheap. So that's why I plug my computer at home into my stereo.
It wasn't until I got involved in video production that I found what I was looking for in the MS20 pair, which was part of a Mac workstation that had been assembled as the best possible solution with a practical budget in mind. The CPU had to be high-end, and for running FCP, a powerful Mac was a given. The people that put together the workstation decided to have powered computer monitors in the Mac alcoves, rather than the headphones that were supplied at the PC workstations in a row on an open counter.
I was skeptical, because price-wise, Behringer is not high-priced gear. But uality-wise, I have always found their products quite competitive at any price. It's as if the product development team at Behringer actually get out and use the gear they produce. Imagine that! But I digress. If you are looking for high-end home theater 
sound, the MS20 may leave you wishing for more. But if you are used to listening to your work on typical computer speakers, you are in for a pleasant surprise.
If you need to fill a cubicle-size room with good sound, get the MS20 and you're set. If you need to fill a classroom or a lecture hall on a regular basis, you might need to spend more and get the MS40. It all depends on your listening environment.
Most of the time I am on headphones when I do my editing. I seldom need to play my work for more than a few people at a time. My position in the video production team is usually audio. At home, my MS20 monitors are used to give room sound to an audio production setup where I feed a keyboard into a multi-track digital recorder. It's nice to hear what I have done before I import it into the computer for further editing.                
Great connectivity, good looking speakers, crisp sound.
I use them connected to the optical out on my Apple TV 2 to replace the average sound from my bedroom TV
Also used with my computer and iPhone
Plenty of base and good value                
Optical in                
Good quality construction                
Sound is great except you cant turn the volume up past 1 without the speakers whistling and burping at high pitched squeeking and shaking.                
NA                
Easy.                
Replace immediately.                
These speakers (Behringer MS20) sound like someone with nasal speech who has just inhaled some helium. The sound was slightly less irritating with the BASS dialed to about 8 pm and the TREBLE to 9 pm. I received them yesterday, but they are going back ASAP.                
No complaint here. Good features with digital and analogue inputs and headphone out.                 
Straightforward, quite easy to use.                
Very low-quality drivers. Can't tell about the electronics. These don't seems to be designed like some of the more expensive "monitors" (no active crossover), which is expected at this price.                
Cheap, but don't deliver where it matters - the sound. In the end you get far less than what you paid for.                
Don't know.                
No, I don't want them.                
I am returning them right away.                
I was getting Some Monitors for my little home studio and heard great things about behringer. So I got some affordable monitors the MS20. I hooked up my Mp3 player and played a deep house song, I was impressed the Bass reproduction. And on a progg metal song I heard Some sounds Ive never hear on my $600 stereo.                 
I like the selection of inputs                
I set it up in about 60 seconds, Just push (power) and select the desired volume.
Simple                 
The Frame Is very solid and well constructed.                
YES ! for a hundred bucks this thing is probley the best for a little home studio.                 
never neded any                
Sounds are Incredably detailed and so simple and straight forward and packs more power then I thought.                 
Powerful and expressive monitors for my home computer audio studio. I connect to my Creative X-Fi sound card's digital out with a coaxial cable into the SPDIF jacks on the MS40s. I was blown away when I first listened. The response is amazing, from the lowest volume levels to pretty high power. I usually run my volume control about 1/3 with plenty of sound and headroom. It was the price that attracted me to these beauties but I cant imagine I would need anything bigger or pricier for my setup. If you want the best for your computer studio, get these amazing sounding monitors, and they look very cool too.                
I bought because of the digital input. I have used both analog and digital and to my ear there is little difference, but I like the idea of the digital input to eliminate any possibility of hum, etc. The bass and treble controls are fine, although I usually run them flat. The up front earphone connection is very handy when my wife goes to bed and I want to work. A very cool feature is that you can input both analog and digital signals, each with its own volume control, and mix them into one sound output. I suppose you could use the earphone out to take this mixed signal somewhere else. Haven't tried this.                
Very easy to set up and control. My biggest decision was which digital connection cable to use, coaxial or optical. I went with coaxial because of its simplicity and its good track record. From what I have read, optical isn't any better, certainly in this set-up.                
Solid, speakers are very well made, amp is flawless. Nice industrial look for your studio. I wouldn't take these on the road without a good case (to protect the exposed woofer.) The wood case it a plus. Black color fits in everywhere.                
So much better than anything you will find at a computer store. Use them just for your computer speakers and you won't be sorry.                
Only on their website, which is very informative.                 
Love the look. Really adds a sense of serious music production to my home studio.                
These babies will last me for a long time. If I ever move up, I can still use them in so many ways.                
I think these speakers sound great!  They handle low and high range extremely well.  I mean for studio monitors, you don't want them to be pumping bass or sounding too tinny anyway.  You want them to be middle of the road so you can hear what the heck you're doing.  I think that these speakers give me a great idea as to what I'm doing sonically.                
Given the fact that there are so many options for connection, I think it should at least come with the basic cables for operation.  It didn't even come with the cable to connect the left & right speakers!!!! I was blown away!  All it came with was a power cord.  I had to call zZounds for a RCA speaker cord.                
Extremely easy to set up and use.  Lots of options as far as connectability; it should be possible for EVERYONE to use them with their setups.                
Extremely solid and looks great right out of the box.  You can tell it was put together by pros.  No loose knobs, switches or connections.  When bass is turned up, you can physically see the woofers expand and there's NO rattle or excessive vibration.  There is a little speaker hiss, but that's normal.  As far as my computer monitor is concerned, it's extremely close and it doesn't affect the speakers one iota.                
I think it's worth every penny, and with the free shipping you really can't go wrong.  I can't see needing anything else for a very long time!  Even if I do "upgrade", these will definately be used as a part of a future setup.                
I had to call and get a speaker wire the day that I received the speakers and they e-mailed me by that evening saying that one was being sent out.  That's my only experience thus far, but it's sure nice getting through to a person in about 1-2 minutes, especially one that isn't based in India!!!!!                
Very sexy setup.  They sit authoritatively on top of my studio desk and just beg to be used.  They want me to go all night, I say "sounds good" . . .                 
As I said above, as I continue to build my studio, these MS40's will definitely be a part of my future setups.  I can't see how they couldn't be.  I'm in love.  If I had to get replacement monitors, I'd stick with these as a replacement if they were damaged in a fire or stolen.  I wish I knew it didn't come with the speaker wire before I bought it and it would have saved me a trip to the store, but it was pretty minor.  I love the sound of them most of all.                  
This pair of NFM surprised me, I had to move from some old speakers to new monitors, I couldn't afford to change the disposition of my hi-fi speakers so I decided to buy a cheap but working pair of monitors.
These ones are really great for the money.
I mean, surely there is something better on the market, sweep test for bass frequences reveals a consistent drop around 50hz (but still moving cones at 20hz with no rattle) and some non linear behaviour, but overall the sound is really good at 50% volume and fits all your (basical) needs for monitoring a recording.
The stereo scene is really precise, I didn't need to emphasize bass or highs.                
best value for the price, I decided for them for the digital input, it's really a plus, no noise at all and really good quality on reproduction, even better than using the external soundcard on my mac and connecting it through RCA.
Surely an XLR connector could be a plus, but for my needs I loved the coax/optical input and was enough for me.
Bass/Treble controls are sensitives, good quality (as new) and nice finitures, looks really like a pro monitor.                
Very simple, connected the two speakers, the digital in and the power plug and they were running.
I put all the controls at 50% (nice feature on the bass/treble knobs is the "middle" position) and did the first soundcheck and they were great.                
These speakers LOOKS really good.
Overall they're made QUITE good, for a cheap product. Cones are in plastic but the rubber is soft and quick, knobs are well built and the overall looking seems solid and semi-pro.                
FOR THE MONEY, they're very very good.
I mean: it's useless in this product range making a comparison with the first reference speaker that costs twice and only for ONE speaker...
As a beginner speaker they give a good stereo scene reconstruction, a nice timbric representation and a good dynamic, used as monitors.
20W are perfect as a power for listening to you music at an adeguate level at a close distance, you cannot use for you home theater environment, but.. they're not made for this!                
Not needed actually                
aesthetically they're great, looks sturdy and well finished, black is a classic for speaker and the white cone is a plus (even if in plastic).
I could ask for a green / blue led instead of the red one, but no more in this class :D                
Actually I'm totally satisfied by the product and for my need of home recording in Garageband it's quite enough.
I think I'd buy again if stolen.                
 These monitors sound rather muffled in the low frequencies. There is no distinct bass punch, just sort of a low bass wash. The mids and highs didn't seem that bad. I have had good experiences with Behringer and thought I'd try these out. Great price. Great looks. Sound just wasn't that great in the lows. Also, the left speaker would buzz/rattle at certain frequencies. I'm pretty sure the woofer was hitting something behind it as it flexed.                 
 There was a good amount of features for sure. Along with the name, great looks and a great price, there was 24 bit/192 kHz D/A converters, and optical and digital coaxial inputs. There was also rca and trs inputs, bass and treble knobs, and separate volume controls for analog and digital. One thing that did surprise me was the speaker cone. From the pictures I thought it was silver metal. It is actually white plastic.                
 In all honesty, I didn't find the bass and treble controls to be very effective or responsive. Maxing out the treble knob did not seem to alter the sound all that much. The bass knob increased the muddy rumble. Other than that, two thumbs up.                 
The craftsmanship seemed great. I noticed no blemishes. The cabinet definitely seemed sturdy. The only problem, other than the sound that didn't suit my tastes, was the buzz/rattle that came from the left speaker when I was monitoring keyboard. I'm sure it was just a defect and sent them back.                 
 I wished the sound quality of these speakers was better in the low ranges so I could get another pair and have some good looking, good sounding monitors from behringer for a nice price. But, I think I'm going to look for another pair.                
 I've owned a used behringer mixer for about 4 years and have had no problems with it. In this case, it was just a slight defect that zzounds took care of. I have never had to deal with Behringer's customer support, but like I said, my experiences with the company's products have been great.                 
Sound is just not quite tight. Everything else is pretty decent.                 
Good home monitors.  A little flat on sound, you have to use DFX software (example: Stereo Tool v8.40) combined with WinAmp.  Then the sound significantly improves.                
These monitors are fine for my application.  I did purchase them for the S/PDIF interface.  The higher end higher priced systems did not have that feathure.  Knowing that my output source would be S/PDIF,  and I mainly write guitar arrangements a good mid to hight range sound would work as long as there was no buzz from the monitors and these proved to be very quite.  If you are playing MP3's based on the nature of what they are you will note the sound is sub par and the low end muffeled                  
Well I bought it for the S/PDIF input feature, but other than that nothing specail.                
Very simple to use but, they should be user friendly                
The quality of the cab looks durable.  However I would never put any type of amplified speaker in danger.  They should last as long as they are not abused.                 
No doubt these are very inexpensive, so if you are into getting just sound for little moneies, this will work.                
Have had no reason to call but from some past exsperince, Behringer techs are honest about their products and will tell you whats up.                
This is just a part of my overall setup. I hope to upgrade from these                
I will keep them until they die but I will not replace with the same. At this price and knowing that Behringer products are not really that service friendly..when they die, they die.                
Worst sounding speakers I've ever tried to like. Their sound is muddy, and when the mud is scooped out their sound is thin. They take all the enjoyment out of listening to music. The only hope of hearing anything clearly is to turn the bass all the way down, as in off. The treble then needs to be dialed in somewhere between 0 and 5 depending on the musical content. Not sure what purpose these were intended for, but they didn't cut it as studio monitors, keyboard speakers, or desktop computer speakers. They do amplify sound in stereo. I'll leave it at that. Nothing against Behringer as a whole, but this is not one of their OK products.                
I love the sound. It gives awesome quality for less the buck. The low frequencies tend to rumble a little if you bump them too hard, but it gives you plenty of bass before it rumbles. Love them! Perfect for starter home studios.                
I love the look of it!                
AS i've read many places now, the sound is very airy. High end is totally jacked on these monitors. These are not a flat response to sound.                
No real features. Multiple ins i guess make it a 4, but the sound is bad enough that it doesn't matter at all.                
They're powered monitors. They're all easy to use.                
I honestly thought these would help me move up on controlling my sound output from the AKG K240 headphones i was using prior (and now am using again), but they have failed me.                
I suppose it's worth the price. I don't know what i was thinking spending so little. Maybe they are the best bang for your buck, but they haven't helped me at all.                
No idea, doesn't matter.                
They look nice. Sound awful.                
I was satisfied for about a week and a half.                
I bought these speakers because of reading all of these other reviews; giving behringer *one* more chance to provide anything quality and to add to my repotoir of speakers and setup. But the truth is, you have to be musicly deaf to not hear that these speakers are sub average and not worth the money, even if it is cheaper; you mise as well throw your money away. The constant airy sound on top of the recording makes you feel like you are in an air plane listening to a weak recording. At 20w a speaker, it sounds more like 10w a speaker. The treble EQ barely changes anything and the bass just make it more muffled. You are paying for the sexy looks of these speakers, but definately not the sound quality.                
It allows for bass and treble EQ on the main monitor and different options for output which allows a user to use these speakers for almost any reason.                 
If you are trying to adjust your mix and speaker gains (whether its on your board, computer or interface) to get good sound out fo these speakers, don't try. It will still sound airy.                 
It is well built, didn't have problems, Behringer knobs are known for being loose with static-prone pots. But it functioned well, just the sound quality was horrible.                
These speakers are the cheapest on the market, and understandably so. I guess for the price you are paying, you get for what you pay for. But in my opinion, still not worth the value for what you spend. My reccomendation is for you to hold out and spend your money on something else.                 
I didn't need support.                 
These speakers are dangerously sexy and therefore extremely very dissapointing. The only thing i liked about these speakers is the way they look. It reminds me of one of those pimped out civics -- all show, but no go!                 
You need to ask yourself what you are buying these speakers for. If you are buying these for close field music recording/mixing, don't bother unless you want a horrible mix and you will just get frustrated on not being able to hear clearly. Although they will make your setup more secy, If its for casual listening, why don't you just buy a low end surround sound system for what you are paying this for, it will be much clearer for casual listening. Regardless, its a waste of hard earned money in my opinion. Purchase something else!                
They look cool but sound like crap...... very buzzy and junky sounding. The headphone jack on mine was plugged and can't be accessed. A total waste of money.                
I've been doing some live on-site recording at several open mics for over a year and a half with a collection of separate splitters, but just reached a limit on how quickly I could adapt to different performers' configurations; and this unit, along with a couple 8x snakes, solved my problems for what I might have spent on just a couple more separate splitters. Behringer's choice of output labeling is unusual, but once you figure it out things are fine. Oh, and watch those Link buttons - easy to accidentally press when plugging in stuff in a hurry! (I have not used/needed Berhringer support.)                
For the price (and size), this little contraption has god-like sound quality.                 
It's a 4-channel mixer. If you've looked at the pictures, its pretty basic. 4 inputs, 4 volumes, 1 output.                
Plug and Go...how much easier does it get?                
Extremely sturdy casing, REAL METAL, not that BS plastic crap. As stated in another review, the knobs would be the first to go, but I opened it up and looked at the circuitboard...they're pretty well anchored in there.                
I have a USB interface for recording, and I bought this for drum mics, and it really does what I bought it for. Once you get up above 5 channels, the prices skyrocket with added features that I'd never need (thanks to Adobe Audition), so this is precisely what I looked for.                
Our bassist has a Behringer Bass Amp, and that thing (literally) rattles the house we play in. Behringer is one of the few companies that make legitimately quality products for the right price. Good Job Behringer!                
Rugged, streamline, simple. It's not as big as it looks. its about the size of 2 cell phones stacked on top of each other, so people who like compact devices, get one. Oh, and...this thing is SEXAAAY!                
Reliable, consistent functionality for cheap. Isn't that what business competition is all about? It might not have built-in EQ or effects or all those, but I do that on our band's PC, so all I needed was something to mix the drums right without having to record 4 separate tracks. If all you need is something small to say, bring a singer's voice over a screamer's, and into only one PA Amp, this would work. $30 is pretty much a bargain for this, I've seen 2-channel mixers over 5x the price, and they're bulkier too. So if you just need a simple mixing solution, this is the way to go.                
I have a nice amp but it only has 1 input and I usually play with another guitar or two and a singer. This little box solves everything for me. I can put any combination of instruments and mics into this and have it work everytime. One really big amp is all that's really needed in most of the places I play. (beaches, backyards, small houses....) The thing is tough too. I was run over once and still kept on going.It's not waterproof though. I lost channel 1 because it got dunked in a kiddie pool. For sure I'm going to get another on to replace it                
Clean, accurate, transparent... all the things you want in a mixer.                
Not many features - four volume knobs, that's pretty much it! But that's exactly what I wanted.                
Good knob design makes the settings easily visible, and smooth controls makes this a simple and easy mixer                
Rugged case gives me no worries. I suppose the knobs might break if I abused this little box, but I'm not worried about tossing it into a case with foot pedals and the like.                
Outstanding value. Just as simple as I want, for a VERY reasonable price.                
(no experience)                
I'm a mobile DJ and needed to have 2 (or more) mics to go through my controller, but it only has one mic input. This little box allowed my to hook up my corded mic for myself and a wireless mic (for audience members) and be able to control them through the one input. EXACTLY what I need. And the price was PERFECT. Everything else I was looking at was $60-$100. (those items did more functions, but I needed something simple). Hooked it up, tested it and it works just like I needed. Great to have individual channel volumes too!                
I am a motorcyclist.  I have three imput devices that I need to listen to through one set of ear buds.  The imput is from a radar detector, xm radio, and cb radio.  I do not have nor need a gps, but if I did, I could listen to it through the MX 400.  The quality of the music from the xm reciever is excellent.                
Being abble to control the volume of each input device, allows me to control which device to have "on top".  At times the radar detector "reports" the presence of McDonalds or a Micro Wave tower.  The Micro Wave tower can cause the radar detector to go off for minutes at a time and it can be truned down while maintaining the music at appropricat levels.                
Plug the devices in and go.                
The device seems indistructable.  I went on an 11,000 mile trip and the MX 400 never gave me a problem.  I whish I could say the same about the devices I connected to the MX 400.                
I have seen other multi imput single output devices used by Motorcyclists that cost 5 times as much and only had one main volume control.                
Haven't needed any.                
I will never regret the purchase of the MX 400 and continue to use it to listen to FM radio and the radar detector at the same time.                
I bought these without hearing them first, based on the surprisingly low price, and good reviews of other Behringer models, and I am bowled over! They are the primary speakers in my home entertainment system, replacing some rather bulky floor standing speakers which were getting tired. As soon as I fired them up I was grinning like a fool. Very detailed and punchy, they breathed new life into audio CDs and movies alike. I have them connected via XLR cables to my Emotiva digital processor/preamp and they are happy to flatten my whole living room with sound when cranked! Way better than a $400 pair of speakers should be, and the adjustments are easy to use and fine tune. You won't be disappointed.                
One word 'WOW'!  I use this for my mobile system for deejaying events and it added that extra punch. Just what I needed, crisp sound and nice build quality! The price for this you can't beat! I definitely recommend this product.                 
Awesome little mixer. I bought this to expand my power amp options down the road; was pleasantly surprised that this mixer has breathed new life into my stereo system and double its sound quality all for $89.95.                 
Very nice easy setup gets the job done.                
I use a wall wart to power my pedals (9 of them) I added the noise reducer to knock out the non isolated hum from my pedals and it works wonders. It has a complete mute setting that totally kills the signal or a reducer setting ( that I use) . People complain about Behringer pedals dying from being stomped on too much, but you wont have to worry about that with this one. You'll always want this pedal on. I use it in line with some notoriously noisy effects including the Mxr Blue Box, Phase 90, a ZVEX Box of Rock, A EHX LPB-1, and a Big Muff. This is a true value. If you're killing buzz on a budget this pedal is for you. It is also AMAZING compared to the Rocktron Hush. The hush humed and buzzed like crazy so I returned it and got this pedal.                 
This is the 3rd noise gate - 3rd company I have tried.
All were quickly returned, except this one.
The NR300 works as advertised.
Does not kill your tone.
Being able to run the insturment in and then all the effects into this pedal before going into the amp via different inputs is great.
It removed all the noise from the pedals as well as pickup noise.
I used a disgram from another brand to see the best/quickest way to set this up. This works like a pedal costing $100.00 more.
With ZZSounds return policy you have nothing to lose.                
Great pedal and inexpensive.
Always on now that I own it.                
Controles are as simple as they come.                
Looks great, bright indicator lights,                
Works as advertised.
The only one I have not sent back.
$100.00 saved over a bigger brand name.                
No need.                
Looks great.
The Blue and Red indicators are easily seen.                
This is a keeper.                
Normally you get what you pay for, but this is a steal.  It takes a little tweaking, but this definitely takes the hiss out of my pedals.  I am amazed at the price and how good a job this pedal does.                
Just got this and hooked it up to my pedal board. It immediately took out the hum of a single coil. That is what I wanted it for, it can be tweaked to eliminate all kinds of noise & hum.                 
I bought this pedal and it sounded terrible.  I was going to throw it away, when a buddy looked at it for me.  He found one of the wires coming from the battery (the positive) barely connected.  once fixed, it is awesome.                
this is the worst thing I have ever spent money on. I have tinkered with this paperweight for hours and it sounds terrible.                
Great power distribution hub. We have 3 of these at our church now and they've been working flawlessly for several months. Great product for the price.                
Our church now has eleven P16-M Personal Mixers. When connected to our Behringer X32 Mixer via the P16-D distribution module, no external power is needed. It is provided over the Ethernet connection. The price and functionality can't be beat.                
Sound doesn't apply to a pedalboard, but it does the job to augment your sound, so I give it a 10 by default.                   
I liked the included AC adapter and chain to save you money on powering the pedals.  I also liked the way everything was neatly put together, but if you have odd shaped pedals, you'll have to find a way to make things fit and that can be somewhat of a nightmare.  I would have also liked it if they had included velcro tape to make everything stay in place.                  
It's simple to put down and start making your chain.  Even if you have to move pedals around, it doesn't take much to set it in a new location.                  
It is a cheaper pedalboard made of hard plastic so don't expect this thing to take 20 foot drops. That being said, it does keep your stuff protected when closed and even though it won't take much in terms of pressure, falls, or physical force it will at the very least keep your stuff together, organized, and safe from the elements.                   
Well worth the price tag, a good buy if you're looking for a pedal board that won't break the bank.                  
This area is non applicable since I haven't had a need to contact them.                  
It is a nice looking pedalboard even though it has giant BEHRINGER logo etched on the outside.  That isn't to say Behringer is a bad company, but it would have looked better with something more subtle.                  
I plan to keep this until I either run out of room or have the money for a professional quality true bypass Pedalboard.  Till then, this will serve me well for the weekend gigs and anything else I play.                  
I bought this pedalboard case in order to simplify my set ups. This case enables me to show up to my gig, connect my bass to it, connect power, connect the amp, and done. When it's time to go, just reverse the order, pop the lid back on, and byebye! The case itself is a hard plastic material, which appears durable but only a few months down the road will tell for sure. The case is lined with foam padding on the lid, and a dense foam material on the base side. I removed the thumb screws (loved that it has thumb screws for everything) and removed the foam cut outs, then lined the remaining pads with double sided tape so they'd stay in place without the screws.  I then threw down a couple strips of velcro and I magically had a pedalboard case that could suit my needs. For the price, it's really difficult to beat all that this pedalboard case is and what comes with it.
Now the stuff I really like about this pedalboard case. I really like that it comes with enough patch cables to set up 12 pedals. I also really like that it comes with a built in power supply unit capable of supporting 12 pedals via daisy chain. Lastly but most importantly I also like that it has these ports built into it so that I can set up my pedals and have it ready for a show without having to do anything else other than hooking up my bass to it, hooking up the power adapter, and hooking up the amp.
The one con which I accepted was how large it is. When I bought it I was under the impression it was smaller. The pro to this is that even though the image shows 12 pedals, you have a lot of real estate an enough room to stick up 20 pedals easily!                
Love it-perfect for boss pedals. I have also managed to fit a small Wah pedal in one of the slots by cuttin the foam a bit-not a rocket since..the included patch cords are ok but I did replace them to a pro level cables. The ac adapter has been been upgraded to a GODLIKE 2.5 Amp-quiet!This is a Very sturdy case that will protect your beloved pedals. The latches are prone to break so treat them gently without bumping them into a hard matter. Overall-well worth it!                
I have had this Board for about 3 months now and still use it! Its an amazing board COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE! made of super strong grade plastic and was crafted very well.  The only problems I had with this board was the daisy chain and patch cables that came with the board were complete trash.  Caused constant humming and buzzing (ground looping).  However, i upgraded my power supply to a one-spot daisy chain and bought brand new patch cables and this pedal board is wonderful! I gig 4-5 times a week and this is my main board and it has held up wonderfully! I have heard stories about the latches breaking however i have not had an issue with them yet.  Overall great board just upgrade the power supply and patch cables!                 
Used for keyboards and the only trouble was I had to get a 12 volt power supply for the fcv100 there's two of them one for organ one for synth

I may get another one for bass but i don't need that much room. PB600?                
I have a mixer that is constantly needing to be fixed.Haven't had that problem with other brands before?                
not under warr.                
Your sound depends on the settings of your pedals.  My guitar can sound as it's in a small room or a big hall.  Depends on how my pedals are set, and how I chain them.  I use Digitech pedals: Reverb, chorus, delay, flange, Ibanez tube screamer, Korg tuner.  The daisy chain also leaves an extra input for my Cry Baby.  How full the sound gets depends on how you tweak your pedals 
The power supply is invaluable.  You would be going to the store non-stop for batteries.  
Stomp boxes eat batteries like my kids eat cereal.                 
The PB600 is much easier than the PB1000 I bought.  The PB1000 was set up backwards.                
The unit is simple to operate. Remember though, pedal sizes vary.  The foam in the PB600 is designed for Behringer pedals.  As I said, I have Digitech pedals. I used an X-acto knife to fit them in tightly(took 10 minutes).  The foam is screwed in so you can easily remove it to meet your needs.  Close it up until the next time you're ready to play.                
Whether you are active, hobbyist, or undecided, you should have one these.   It will organize your gear on-stage, get the boxes out of your wife's way or make you sell that guitar you got for Christmas.                
Should have called them on the PB1000                
Black resin didn't seem sexy to me this morning, and still isn't.                
I'll use it until I, or someone I know, decides the piece of equipment  isn't important.  So, it will be a long time.                
I play a Carvin guitar, currently through five pedals, into a Vox VT+ series amplifier. I notice no degradation in sound quality, hiss, noise, hum or other interference.                
Rubber footed "base" keeps board from sliding on most surfaces. Interior areas are expandable to include larger wah pedals, or custom sized pedals if needed. You will need to remove / add foam or inserts to secure larger or smaller pedals. Also, nothing moves once the case is closed and sliders are locked. Nice tight fit around pedals and components, travels well.                
Case packs up quick, keeps everything neat and does not take up that much of a footprint in small clubs or limited spaces.                
As an adult gigging guitar player, playing about two shows a month, I can not think of a way you could damage this board. Something not mentioned often is how the board "looks" professionally. I do not mean the Behringer name (which I have no issue with) but as a performer getting paid for a gig or function. The board presents a clean, uniform look for your effects, and keeps all of the wires and "spaghetti" cleaned up and pro looking. I watched countless videos about building your own pedal board, with drywall screws, velcro tape, cords and lights everywhere and at the end it weighs 50 pounds, looks like a soap box race car without wheels and costs twice as much. Guitar projects are great, and a lot of fun. I wish I had the abilities of the guys who can build and wire their own boards. I don't. This is a great alternative, and presents a nice image if your in a church band, function band, or night club.                
Yes. I viewed it this way:Board: $50Adapter and Daisy Chain: $25.00Shipping: $25.00This board arrived in a large, professionally packed box.                
I have not dealt with Behringer. I have interacted with zzounds on several occasions, all positive.                
The board is lightweight, has a solid feel and construction and fits six Behringer, or Boss shaped pedals with no modification to interior foam. Power supply, daisy chain, patch cables, free shipping? Great deal.                
This pedal board came out of the box ready to use and with patch cables and power for 7 effects. It took me less than 30 minutes to make my pedal board ready to play. Foam is already cut for Behringer or Boss sized effects. But can be easily sized for larger or smaller sized effects.                 
I wanted to put a pedal board together and on a budget. So budget and Behringer go together always. You can tell that a lot of thought went in to this product. This is an all in one pedal board that comes complete with everything you need to start your chain. The coolest thing about this is that it is already pre-wired for you. You plug into the board and not into the pedals themselves. There is also a area for you to hide your daisy chain for power making this a very clean looking area. While I don't use a waw pedal you can even make an area for that. There is also 6 jumper cables for your six pedals. All in all this is like all Behringer products a good dollar value with lots of features. I was able to buy this pedal board and 6 Behringer pedals and got away for under $250.00.                 
Purchased this from zZounds.  Received it in two days in California.
The board is wonderful.  I have all Boss & Behringer effects and they fit perfectly in the box.  The wire management is quite good and everything is really neat when installed properly.  I no longer have effects boxes sliding around the floor.  It's the best $99 I've spent in a long time.  The power supply is quiet and adds no Power Line artifacts to my audio guitar signal.  At 170 MA it's very suitable for a six position pedal board.
This pedalboard is so good for the money                 
Not a sound producing item                
Includes the power adaptors and patch cables.  Would like velcro also, but that's easy to find locally.                
Pretty intuative.  Arrange your pedals, plug them up and secure the loose cables in the track.  Makes for a neat, relatively uncluttered apearance.  Close it up, and carry it like a suitcase.                
Great board.  Patch cables are entry level, but work fine.                
Including the power adapter and patch cables make this a great value.                
Have not dealt with manufacturer.                
Probably not as cool as a custom one or some of the other, more expensive ones, but I can't play that well anyway.                
I have purchased(2) of these Behringer PMP1680S Powered Mixers since January of this year, and "I Really Love Them"...I run a Karaoke and Dj service that has gigs 4 nights a week(each show is around 5 hours in length) and Im a musician in a gigging band 1 night on the weekend, so I really give these 2 Powered Mixers a workout, and they have performed Flawlessly! This thing really puts out some power and it sounds great..This amp is very light weight, has very quiet Mic Outs, has built in eq's,dual effects, is rack mountable, and Sounds better and has More Power than a lot of the "High Dollar" Brands out there at about half the cost! I am able to do everything from running sound for my 5 piece Blues Band (4 mics,Keys,laptop,monitors,mains) to Djing/Karaoke (4 mics, laptop,mains, subs,and monitor for karaoke)..This thing has met my expectations and more, Its a compact solution for someone like my self who loves to Play/Make Music but hates to lug around huge racks of gear for gigs..This thing sounds great, and the Price is Phenomenal!!!Zzounds has given me great service, and fast delivery on every purchase that i have made from them, and they will beat a competitors price if you find it cheaper at another online music store! Thats why i wont buy music gear from anyone but Zzounds..                
I LOVE BEHRINGER! I wish they would endorse me!! 
I recently purchased the Behringer EUROPOWER PMP1680S 1600-Watt 10-Channel Powered Mixer with Dual Multi-FX Processor and FBQ Feedback Detection System, and I can't tell you how much I LOVE this unit!
I talked to U.S. South East. reps at Behringer before I made my purchase and told them how much I would promote this company if it was everything they said it was. They did not disappoint. I am a veteran musician and have shared the stage with many Multi-Platinum Hard Rock and Alternative bands from Blue Oyster Cult to Collective Soul, so I know what I am talking about when it comes to sound and quality. 
Here is what I found, comparing this unit while performing with my 3 piece acoustic band, and mind you, we don't have a live drummer. 
These comparable systems, which are much more expensive, I either own or have used. 
The Yamaha 1200 watt unit, I own,  has 2 matched mains and monitors, and clips like mad when trying to push it for more volume. During an outside performance, my former sound man, who was there with his gear, insisted tethering off our main out, to his gear, because we weren't being heard well about 100' out. He broke out his Behringer 1200W amp and 2 Behringer 15" mains between our 1st & 2nd set. 
This would be my first encounter with this company's equipment and I was so blown away by the sound quality difference, that it got me seriously looking at Behringer. Thanks Butch! You ROCK! 
Mackie's 1200 watt unit, which I did not get to push, as it was inside gig and not mine, performed well but had "powered" matched mains and 12" wedges, which if you have a few grand laying around, sure you can have something that sounds like that, but it still only had one effect processor and not as many bells and whistles as the Behringer, even though it's highly regarded as industry standard.
Now for the Behringer: WOW!! But first,  A BIG shout out to Zzounds.com, from where I made my purchase!! Every struggling artist who wants pro gear, but does not have the bulk cash to buy it, needs to know about this site and their (Pay as you Play) NO INTEREST policy, using your debit card. Look into it if you haven't already! I LOVE this store, and they will beat any advertised site on the net. I've tried it and they came through. SUPER fast "FREE" ground shipping too!! 1 to 3 days! AWESOME!!! www.Zzounds.com 
OK back to my review: I wanted to see JUST how much I could push this unit, as it comes with a 30 day FULL money back warranty from Zzound, SO during a large event, I hooked this bad boy to a pair of Mackie 15" S500 passive mains, a set of 12" 500W passive mains and a set of Carvin 15" wedges, cranked it about 1/2 way and HOLY S#@% was it AWESOME! 4 hour show and not one clip or problem from this great little unit. 
This performance was at the Brookhaven Amphitheater at Bald Hill on Long Island, N.Y. and I can't begin to tell you, the clear, warm and LOUD, sound was just amazing!! We received so many compliments on how good it sounded from 40 to hundreds of feet away! ALL for UNDER $500!? They even threw in a free set of 25' ""SPEAKON" cables!   
Oh yeah, I'm a fan, now if I can only get that endorsement deal.......
Check out our orig / cover band, Mojo Wire, at www.MojoWireRocks.com or just take a listen to my 1st release "Save Me" from my upcoming album " The Darker Side of Light" right here on Indaba! 
Thanks!!

Haven't needed yet                
I play acoustic/electric and I feel the sound is a bit too "electric like" when playing with direct input.  But, mic-ing my acoustic amp produces an excellent sound.                
I wish it had a direct out for digital data, and also more effect processors with ability to switch around on the fly.  I know these changes would increase the price.                 
I barely had to look at the manual.                
Very well thought out design.                
Haven't needed any.                
Highly recommended                
Highly recommended                
I just bought the behringer 1680 power mixer and love it. It has GREAT power and works great for outside shows. When its time to upgrade it will be another behringer thats all i i have ever owned.  
I like the Fx it has                
Great! I set it just like i had my old behringer set and no need to change anything just tweek it here and there if needed                
Light To Carry And Never Worry About It Letting Me Down.                 
Compared to other brands the quality is well worth the price. Ive uses pevey in the past and this 1680 will perform as well or better for less money.                
Zzounds is Great And Answer any ? you Have                
it looks attractive.                
When behringer up grades the 1680 to something equal to it i will replace it.                  
Pleased with it in every way shape and form. Put it to the test in a live 5 piece band. Never had a worry with it. Can't beat the sound, the price, the look and all the features it has. Would recommend this to all looking for quality Pa system. Rock On my friends                
Cant go wrong with this mixer! Good power. The effects are second to none. Our drums sound killer mic'ed into this along with bass and guitar. Has enough headroom for our singer to shine!                
Great sound no feed back I would recommend  this product more bang for the buck best value..                
Fantastic for small medium venues.  Voice cancellation works to remove 90% of vocals.  Powerful output too.  I use out puts to a monitor amp for on stage monitoring.  All works flawlessly.  Much light to carry as well.                
Does what ever you ask and then some. Easy to work with and very quiet. I had a bit of a humming noise when hooked up to my laptop. Installed a ground effects isolator and now it's perfect. Great for small or medium sized rooms. No cons so far.                
I bought a Berringer 1680s 3 yrs ago and it was an awesome mixer. Performed extremely well. Sadly to say, it got fried during a lightning storm. I got a replacement and it worked very well. My wife was using the replacement mixer when the sound went out and all the lights started flashing. I called the co. and they told me the unit was not covered under the warranty because the warranty was covered under the 1st unit that was fried. I had this unit only 7months and no warranty on it. NOT acceptable. I believe that any new unit should have the warranty upon the date you purchased it regardless if it is a replacement or not.....it is still "supposed" to be new. I am not pleased with the Co. policy for this unit.                
I recently purchased another Beringer PMP1680s Powered Mixer from Zzounds ...I already own one of these,  but, I liked it so much that I decided to buy another one for my other(2nd) Karaoke/DJ system...The 1680s sounds great, has cool features( eq, dual effects, feedback locator, 10 channels, and very quiet Mic Outs) ..I use my 1680s every weekend for my Karaoke/DJ Show, I t has worked Flawlessly! I have received several compliments on my sound from patrons at the Club where I play..I am really pleased with this Powered Mixer, lots of power and options at a great price, what's not to like, and Zzounds service and delivery is fantastic...                
I recently got my Beringer PMP 1680S Powered Mixer that I had ordered from Zounds..It sounds fantastic and has lots of features (Dual Effects) it is simple to set up and use and the new design is lighter and it looks pretty cool also..Compared to my last 2 powered mixers( Peavey  and Yamaha) this thing sounds better, has more power and is a real bargain..Zzounds is just an Awesome Online Music Store, I found a cheaper price at a competitor, and Zzounds beat it, and I received my Mixer in 4 days from time of order, with free shipping..I won't shop anywhere else, great service, fast delivery!                 
The Behringer PMP1680S Powered Mixer is a piece of junk.  I had it for two months and it stopped working.  Don'y waste your time and hard earned money on this product!                
Received this unit and Power a massive Peavey Speaker Array, in a 40 by 80 garage. Clean, crisp power with awesome effects. Hook your phone or ipad dial your favorite songs, sit back ad relax. Have miked the lead guitar, base, drums, and B3 up - blown it through the Peavey array with 4 vocal mikes - the Behringer PMP2000 brought it!!!                
I paired this with a pair of Peavey PV215  speakers and I've only setup in my basement for four piece classic rock band. I planned on using mainly as a practice P.A. so we could leave the gigging P.A. packed until needed as it is alot of work setting up and tearing down. First off setup and dialing this system in is very easy and fast. I found a clear sound with more than enough bottom for our needs . There's enough inputs for bass , guitar , drums and three vocals. I'm sure that this very small system could cover most bars we will book. I'm surprised that this setup isn't shown as a pre-packaged system . My initial thoughts are this unit is a home run for us , time will tell how durable it is but so far clean , powerful and easy sums it up.                
It is A Awesome  MIXER/BRAIN. very powerful, and the pay as you go plan is awesome too, i have had only one product damaged and the return policy is super easy,  i have used zZounds For Years and will continue to use them also.. do not hesitate on buying this mixer it is worth every penny you spend on it.. Buy it..                 
I like the power and and the simplicity . I use with a pair of PV 215 speakers and i feel the sound I get is great . My intention when i bought it was to keep it in my jam room and be able to have practices and or jams / parties and for this it's more than i need. I play cd's and my smart phone through it and it's awesome to practice on my own with. I don't intend on taking it in and out of my basement ,( speakers are kinda heavy ) it's a luxury for me . I'm sure it would be fine in most places I would play . I have only had it about 6 months but no issues . I'm happy for the money and I want to thank zZounds for the pay as you play program .                
Downsized from all the amps mixers ect bought this unit and a pair of Peavey Speakers and wow Talk about a match made from heaven. and yes there is a monitor out On back left side becomes monitor and right side is the mains                   
Before buying this unit be aware that there are no monitor outputs on this unit even though there is a separate EQ section for monitors and a separate monitor volume level for each channel. It's fine as a straight mixer with the 2 main outputs but I expected a separate monitor out especially since it has all the controls for it. I called Behringer and asked them how to hook up the monitors and they said it's not possible. Major disappointment in this design of this mixer and am returning it for one that has the outputs that match the controls.                
2 years on straight and still works for bar application controlling live sound satellite radio and internet jukebox. people have told me don't buy this brand it will break. NOPE after leaving it on for 2 years straight im waiting lol. i'm buying a backup as we speak so when this one does decided to take a break, the new one will go into service while the other one is on temporary vacation.                
I got this to DJ/KJ at several bars and clubs and private gigs all over the east coast. I got it to replace a Samson 500 Watt mixer. I use a pair of Yamaha club series and a pair of Sound Tech with 15" and horns. I also run an iNuke 6000d on a pair of MTX 12" subs... The Samson always ran out of power but this one... WOW... It's not as clean as the Samson, but it is TONS more power. It is def. clean enough, and I have DJed places lately that have taken bands off the schedule every night I can take, all because of how I sound, and rock the house. I DO run an external EQ because the on board is just not enough for me but that is all... The effects are good too...                
This Power Mixer soudns Fantastic for the DJ on the go and works great in the studio as well,                 
Could use an USB in/output                
I would by another for sure.                
I am satisfied with my Behringer mixing board. Great sound, nicely portable with built in handle, 100 fx presets, built in voice canceler for vocal practice and karaoke. Now this is my first board so I don't have a lot of experience, however , I was so excited when I got it, already had mics, speakers, stands, instruments etc. first thing I did was rip it open and set it up. But to my surprise the speaker outputs were neither 1/4 inch jacks or low impedance jacks so I grabbed the phone and called a few different music stores before I called Guitar Center who had adapters for $20 a piece. So I had to jump in the car and drive half An hour to buy them then half an hour back. Now for the most part the board works like most but there are a few advanced gadgets. Have fun looking in the Manual for any assistance because it would be better used as toilet paper! Sure there are diagrams on how to hook it up a few different ways but not much more. In fact there are 25 titled fx presets printed right on the board but god forbid they could have listed the other 75 in the Manuel!
Don't get me wrong, once you learn and memorize the features of the board it's an excellent piece of equipment. I am curious as to why you have to practical max out the main and channel volumes to get where you need to be.                
More than pleased, run a karaoke show and I can make em sound like rock stars, amp pushes 4 15" speakers with ease, and can make the windows shake, sound much better than the self powered set-ups                
top notch mixer for all needs                
As described. No issues. Works great. A perfect mixer for DJ, light ensemble, karaoke. Plenty of power.                
I have a Mackie PPM1012 and bought this as a second mixer. It is a decent mixer. Power is good, sound is good and I am able to work with it just fine. Better signal lights would be nice, and a lamp would be great. The Speak-On plugs are nice but a pain at the same time. I still prefer my Mackie over this but for the money it is a decent mixer and have no problem recommending it to people, but would say it is better if you have some experience.                 
Good quality, size and mixer power rating was listed in product description.                
Overall a decent bag. Would be nice if they included some dense foam to take up space to keep mixer from moving around.                
I am not going to go into a huge review on this mixer. But I am a fan of Behringer products. Own this mixer and very nice Bass amp. This mixer is very nice.
1. Controls are very smooth and not touchy.
2. Learning curve is great. I was not looking for a over complicated mixer and this one is great.
3. Sound is very crisp and clear of ANY noise. I have not even had to use the noise cancellation thing at all.
4. Effects have great options to adjust all of them to your liking.
5. Unit is very compact but extremely high quality. 
6. This is for my studio I have not played out with it yet. But it would make your ears bleed in the studio.
zZounds:
Their payment plans are excellent. They are by far in the lead with this simple concept. I did the 4 month plan and this was at my house in 2 days. This was my first purchase with them and I will do more. Great job guys...                
I was worried that the PMP500 may not drive the sound needed for my 5-6 pcs R&B, Blues band. No worries, the band loved it, the 250 cap house loved it. Great for tight set ups.                 
When it arrived, I took it to the church and unboxed it.  It was very easy to set up!  Very powerful and really clean sound. There were no problems getting it to go.  And I mean GO! Pure, clean power, easy to use and compact!  It even has a handle for easy movement!                  
its been a long time since I've used a mixer and tho it's self explanatory honing in everything is a bit touchy but I really like it                 
I really should have known better. I have dealt with Behringer products over the years and knew they were incredibly unreliable but, I have seen the reviews steadily getting better and better over the years and thought maybe they had improved. Well, I was wrong.
The digital effects sounded terrible and the entire mixer started going out after less than two weeks. No more Behringer for this guy.
zZounds on the other hand, is awesome!                
After eight months the Aux In level control doesn't work. Now, one month after the warranty expired the Main Mix level controls are going fast. Time to get out the duct tape and hope for the best. I'll buy the QSC GX5 and a dedicated mixer, because I know better now.                
This little mixer is great for Karaoke or if your trio needs small mixer. The send to powered speakers is so clean and the power out to speakers works great for monitors. mp3 player works great too.Sound is clean out of this little mixer.                
Love this small mixer, it is light weight with a small form factor but still has plenty power. The class D amp is very cool and high temp is not an issue. It is great for my dj gigs in small venues.                
Sounds great and is easy to use.  The feedback reduction system actually works quite well. I was pleasantly surprised.
It is a nice amp.  Time will tell if it lasts as long as my old 25 year old Peavey.  For 550 watts, it does not sound as loud as I expected, but it seems to stay clear even at higher settings.  Overall a nice piece of equipment.
I've bought and used many Behringer products throughout the years and have never been disappointed. The little guy is a beast! It pushes my JBL 12" floor monitors with plenty of headroom. The effects are excellent although I only use plate reverb. No phantom power but so what. It does have a wireless microphone adapter built in which I could see useful for MC work. It should easily cost double what I paid and it's so light and compact it will fit anywhere including the top of my guitar amp. Excellent choice for rehearsals, and small crowds.                
This was exactly what I needed for smaller gigs where my 18 channel Behringer unit was excessive and I didn't need all of those inputs.                
I am an avid karaoke singer that has always wanted equipment that a professional could use. This unit filled the bill It's powerful, versatile, and has a clean clear crisp sound from highs to lows. For the price, it's the best thing I've found after exhaustive searches and reading many reviews here and elsewhere. You can't go wrong...Pro or amateur.
I have not needed Manufacturer support, but it's required to rate it, so I gave it a 5 star rating just knowing they are a top rated company.                
Received the mixer in just four days. Great shipping.Have used it twice and it performed great. Have only turned it up about half way. It has a plenty of headroom. It does great with my two  15 inch JBL's.  Thanks to ZZOUNDS  and Behringer.  Lynn Huneycutt  Albemarle North Carolina                
Myself and all the guys who I jam with love the new mixer. It is very easy to use and has a great sound.                
For the money, this is unbeatable! I have played professionally for nearly 30 years, owned nearly every piece of sound equipment you could have through the years. If you are tired of hauling racks of heavy and far more expensive gear to do a small gig, or a rehearsal, this mixer is for you ...........and me! Very happy with this unit. No it doesn't sound like a million bucks, but if you know anything about sound, or have a good ear, it will do the job. Then you can keep the other $999,700.oo in your pocket                
I've owned several Behringer mixers, the only reason I've sold them is I keep current with their gear. The first two mixers are still being used around town. This mixer is the best bang for the buck I've ever seen. It's powerful, light, very sophisticated for the price. It actually kicks butt on all the other mixers twice the price. 
Now a word about the reviewer who gave this one star. It really irritates me that people who hate Behringer go around and write fictitious reviews on equipment they don't even own. If you read the reviews you can figure out they're lying. Some people just hate Behringer and for no good reason. Don't listen to their baloney, they are liars and don't add to the reviews in any way.                
Been playing professional since 1989. For a small gig or rehearsal this will do the job. Wish someone made equipment like this when I was young and spent $2k to do the same job as this unit.                
Sound was never great, woefully underpowered, and now 2 separate failures in a little over a year (the 2nd one is not being covered, boo!) and you only get 3 year warranty if you register within 90 days. Don't. Just don't. :(                
The Preamps on this unit are fantastic. They are clean and give alot of headroom. Being the singer, It's important to  me for the words to get across in live situations. For fun, we hooked this up and recorded live, just some musical ideas. Put a mic in front of each guitar cabinet and vocal. The PFL button. (pre fader level) helped me achieve a very clean sound without clipping. The effects are useable, it will take a little bit of time to dial in the effects for your situation.                 
This thing is full of features. If you dont like the built in effects, you can run outboard effects. The Overall EQ is decent. No it is not a 32 band eq. It's 7. It's enough to dial in a better overall sound. The Stereo imaging feature was very nice. Also love that this unit has the behringer speaker processor. In case youre mains can't handle lows very well. Feedback kill function works mice as well.                 
Well, great sound is all in the listener's ears. It didnt' take me much time at all. Read the manual, then hook it up. I ran 2 mains in stereo at 8ohms. This was loud enough to compete with a drummer, 2 guitar players and a bass player. For drums, either get another small board, or run 3 mics. 2 overhead, one of the kick. The sound from this thing was just unreal. Very good.                 
Product seems well built. no blemishes, cosmetics are ok. I plan on using this on the road...but a case is something I need to invest in.                 
For the price range, this is the most xlr inputs I could find. I needed a power amp or a powered mixer. This this fits my needs well. After shopping for several months, I decided on this unit. It allows the opportunity to grow as money and maturity allow. (you can add another power amp, you can add outboard effects or eq. It even has an out for a sub, with a built in limiter.  I would have liked to see the build in compressor in this unit, but it has a lot of features that are useable. Took no time in getting used to the layout.                  
haven't contacted them.                 
It looks decent. Sex appeal...well if red and orange get you off you're gonna love it. Sitting in our rehersal space, yes it is pretty impressive.                
This thing should last a long time. It's class d amp technology, I don't understand how it works, but it does. This machine ran for 10 hours straight and stayed cool to the touch. fans are quiet. the standby button is a very nice feature. (kills sound to all channels) I love this thing. If you can't get a good sound with it, then you don't know what you're doing. 
I would buy it again if stolen. Behringer gets a bad rap, while it is true thier earlier stuff had some quality control issues, this is the second piece of gear I have bought from them, and it works very well.                 
I am impressed! We use about 13 of the channels for vocals,keyboard and pedal steel. So far, the EQ on the individual channels has been all we've needed. I leave the Graphic EQ set flat. Never been able to do that before. There is lots of output. My speakers are old 8ohm cabs and there is still lots of volume. I use one channel for mains and the other for monitors and it works great. We play a very diverse range of music and I'm pleased to say that this board seems to cover it all well.                
There just seems to be all the buttons and knobs that are necessary for all we would need. I was worried when I read some reviews about the on-board effects. So far, I'm finding everything we need. I'm pleased to say that it all works well.                
The layout is staight-forward and the colors used to separate the different sends are easy to see but not obnoxious. I really like the switch for going from mono to left-right channels and the speaker matching feature is cool.                
This is the second piece of Behringer gear I own. It was perfect out of the box. All the knobs and controls feel solid and the same. No changes from one channel to another,etc. I've pushed it pretty hard so far and it still works. I hope it lasts a long time as it does what I expect out of it.                
The 700watt power amp that I replaced with this purchase, cost more used than this whole unit!                
I've never needed any repairs done yet but I did have a question and they got right back to me with an answer.                
As I mentioned before, the colors and the lay-out are great. Not sexy or flashy, just easy and usable.                
Being able to use 2 effects at the same time, sent to mains and/or monitors, separate Graphic EQ's for mains and/or monitors was why I bought this model. I won't be for want of a different unit for the foreseeable future.                 
i purchased this mixer and it worked and sounded great. i was using powered mains, not the internal power amp. when i went to use the internal power amp, for my monitors, only the A side worked? Nothing would come out of the B side. I researched further, and read a whole lot of negative reviews, about this problem & Behringer's Quality control. I took mine to my favorite nearby music store, and they fixed the problem INSTANTLY! In order for ther internal power amp to run 4 monitors @ 4 ohms, you have to "trick" the mixer. Insert a jumper from L power amp insert to A monitor send, then do the same thing on the B side. Now i have all 1600 watts pushing my 4 monitors, using the internal power amp. Quick fix & only cost $10 for the jumper cords. I was ready to ship it back, because i thought the mixer was defective. The way Behringer designed this unit, they want YOU to buy an External power amp! NO NEED TO FOR THAT. PROBLEM SOLVED.  I hope this helps out any further folks stumbling on this problem.                
So far I've worked 4 gigs with the new Behringer board and the sound qulity has skyrocketed. I was using a Phonic Powerpod 1860 but it was constantly clipping and cutting out at higher power levels. I original used it as a soloist but it wasn't handling the band volume. 
This Behringer really fits the bill! I would recommend it to any band working lounges or outdoor gigs.                
I am very happy with this mixer. I had it up, plugged in, and running our worship team in just a few minutes. We've had it over a month and have zero issues with the mixer. At this point I would rate it as excellent. I am hoping for some longevity with this and don't see why I won't get it.                
I work with a lot of different boards and very much like the features on this one. I like the multiple effects and the ability to tune each channel seperately. The power is great since I do as much outside work as inside. Also works well in the studio.                
The effects are great. I really like the feedback indicators built into the equilizer. Great power. I would put it up against any of the higher priced brands.                 
Learning the effects and how to adjust them was a little difficult without a manuel.                
Seems to be well constucted. Had one button cracked when I unpacked it with no visable package damage.                
Very much worth the money. Definitely equal or better than higher priced models.                
Looks good. Differing colors on control knobs allows for quick identification.                
I have had this for a few years it is still going strong!! I will buy again when the time comes.                
I purchased a previously returned powered mixer. The listing on the website promotes buying these items as a great deal and savings. That part is true. I would be very cautious ever doing this because of the terrible packaging.my 25 pound stereo mixer was shipped in the original box, but without any cushioning material. A wad of paper was included in the box. During shipment, the box was dropped and the mixer was damaged. It still works but can't be fixed without paying a fortune. I was offered a return but I can't afford a new unit. Be careful.                
 Everything you need and more for a friendly price! The power section is a tad overdone on the spec sheet but still powerful enough for a small band!                
I bought this head to run non powered cabs. Ended up buying some powered mackies instead and the head runs it great. great head room quite.                
It sounds great when it works. Had this product less that 6 months, in less than a week Channel 1 had some issues. Then it sounded like my speakers were distorting. I rebuilt them totally with high quality selenium drivers. And it sounded awesome. I decided to put some serious horns in my cabinets. And it still sounded great with everything at unity gain. Then all of the sudden melt down.                 
This product has almost everything you could want for a mixer.                
Interface is intuitive but the effect processors could have better readouts                
It appears out of the box well made. But the knobs are cheaper plastic and can come off. I would definitely get a case of some kind to protect it. Additionally the advertising states this is a 1600 watt board. If you run it like most it's 800 watts at best 400 per side. So to me that is less than half of the rated power. What small band is going to run this thing in bridge mode?                 
It's ok but not great!                
Initially it all seemed pretty nice, however took two weeks before the repair shop could even look at my board, then Behringer has the part on backorder, that tells me that these things are dying left and right. I have been without my board for over a month now and my band has lost out on numerous gigs. If you are a local band playing clubs every weekend DO NOT buy this product. Man I wish I had my Mackie gear again.                
I'm looking now.                
My wife and friends had purchased this unit with great expectations from another retailer for me for my birthday. It was sadly disappointing. For such a "powerful" unit it put out about 30 watts of power. I called Behringer 2 times and got "techno speak" from someone that told me that digital output was different from analog. I had compared it to my Fender Passport unit that put our far superior sound. I brought the unit to a sound engineer to look it over and he said that it was sorely deficient and putting out according to specifications. Behringer  did not offer any substantive help and deflected an inquiry. I ended up returning the merchandise back and getting a complete refund. I also spoke with other musicians that had the same issue with their Behringer powered mixers, so I know it was not a fluke. Caveat Emptor!                
The unit was defective and the manufacturer was completely uninterested.                
Great mixer, however I would advise you on buying Extra amps or just buy a regular mixer with no amp built in and buy the Amps separately, I have a Salsa Band, 13-15 Channels working, trust me, this did not cut it, I'm buying a regular Behringer and 2 Amps to power my speakers and subwoofer,                
I've had buyers remorse ever since. I was hoping to save money because of the price difference between this and Peavey. All I've had is trouble and for the second time in less than two years of having it, I'm without sound again. I had forgotten about how impossible it is to get ahold of the warranty department until just now after waiting for over 20 minutes then finally giving up and leaving a callback number. Like the last time, I don't expect a call any time soon.                
I bought this unit new and A little over a year later it stopped working, now the lights just flash on it, nothing else. its hard to get any parts for it , what the heck, manuel is a peace of crap. now I have a $6 hundred peace of junk. I will never again own anything with the behringer name on it, by the way, it comes from germany. no one around here can fix it. dont buy this unit. it sucks.                
It is a great setup for the first time Podcaster or studio recording. You will begin to understand and master the basics of audio, recording, editing etc. Good luck to those who purchase it.                
I have only had it for only a week. I have used it for several live online broadcast with an omnidirectional mic and everyone said the sound was great. I wish the unit had an on and off switch.                
I own this product and I must say for the price you get a good deal. Depending on the speakers you have, the saound quality is decent and actually could even be used for a little kareoke or amatuer live sound. The audio interface that came with the bundle, though, was...well...worth the money. I tweaked with everything I could think of and got nothing but a gargled sound and static from it when used on my computer. The product bundles are very limited also if you're into recording. You may want to get a recording mic also.                
As I said it actually isn't bad for the price. For general amatuer podcasts and recording, the accessories are easy to figure out and accessible. The mixer delivers a clean sound. The mic isn't the greatest, though, and the interface is aweful.                
It's actually very easy to use and set up....unless you run into a problem. The guides that came with the product weren't in english so I couldn't understand anything in them.                
Quality is not bad. I praise the work on the mixer once again for its durablity because it's been through hell. As for the mic and the interface, it'd be best to make sure those stay protected at all times.                
You get what you pay for. It's worth $99 as a bundle.                 
I have not dealt with the company.                
This product isn't a technical marvel...let's be honest. This type of thing has been arround for years. It's pretty basic.                
I've had this for a few months now and once again I love the mini mixer that came with it. It works for my recording needs since I only use a few channels at a time anyway and it sounds great. As for the interface I've upgraded to an E-MU 0404 Audio/MIDI Interface which gives me a hell of a lot more accesibility. I use recording mics for drums but I still use the mic that came with it for vocal recording just because it saves money. I bought an M-Audio pre amp to help it along but it gets the job done. Overall it's not bad for what you spend for it. I definately recomend this for amatuers.                
Have only had this system for a little over a month and I already love it. I host Karaoke shows and have for the past eighteen years. In the past, using my laptop, I would have to stream my background music on a separate program than my karaoke. This put a big strain on my CPU and made for frequent crashing and glitches. Now I can stream my music from an iPod connected via Bluetooth to the system and run my karaoke on a different channel on the mixer, so it lightened the load on my CPU and my shows are clean and smooth. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a system that is easily broken down for travel. Great for weddings and public speaking too! The Behringer PPA2000BT is the perfect solution for DJ's on the move. Highly recommended! Crisp highs and a booming low end, this thing has it all. Not to mention a ton of built in effects and the ability to connect the Behringer wireless mics via the USB jack on the board.                 
Behringer 2000 is a fine system for venues up to 200 or more people. The Bluetooth capabilities you can't do without once you've used them. The Teknik effects are a must have that you don't get with other systems. Beware though, you don't get the speakers with the YELLOW Behringer symbol on the front unless you upgrade. The microphone, you let others use for karaoke. I upgraded to a Sennheiser 935, which sounds great with this system, even with the provided cables. I'll be upgrading to the S. 965 soon. The 20 foot cables are good but they will be upgraded also. A longer cable is what I'm looking for. Overall the system is great. I'm going to add a subwoofer and may upgrade to the Yellow tagged speakers. I'll be buying a second one.                
So this is a great product. It's made larger than it needs to be, I think partially in order to provide some protection to the contents. In my case, that's not necessarily a good thing, as I travel across country and bought this PA system for that purpose. 
I suppose if I was to do it again, I may look at a different system, but since I have it, I'm very happy with it so far. It has alot of features I'd not traditionally use (like the effects processor), and some that have come in more handy than I expected (like the wireless mike port and the bluetooth connectivity). 
Overall, I think Behringer really considered portability and performance in this package. Had they just focused a little more on compactness (even a few inches), it would fit nicely into traditionaly Pelican boxes. 
In order to ship this product through the airlines, I looked to have a custom box made. I was pretty impressed that I could have one made for around $250. 
Fortunately, I was able to find a cheaper (and probably more temporary) option at walmart. the i-fly fiber hard-shell expandable suitcase fits this unit like a glove. You have to expand the case and unnzip the partition, but it fits with inches to spare, allowing you to check this unit in without any extra expense (it comes in just under 55 lbs, too). I looked at hundreds of cases, totes, etc. before finding this little $70 gem. 
At any rate, I'm using a sennheiser ew-100 mic pack and the sound is crystal clear; I'm also using the optional Behringer wireless microphone and the bluetooth connectivity to my computer for music. It's performed flawlessly so far.                 
Works great. Using with my Shure Beta91A mic and it does the job                
I believe I purchased 2, while only meaning to purchase 1 and neither fit and was unfortunately in an accident and failed to return them, but they do not fit. you would think I was looking for the holy grail... I also want to say that your previous service has been outstanding, and I believe your co. has integrity. Otherwise I wouldn't bother with this.                
Performs flawlessly with no noise and no signal degradation. Built like a tank and feels solid and weighty. Great price for what you get (check out other patch bays and you'll see). I added another rack to my project studio and needed another bay (this is my second px3000) to handle the new routings. The switches beat the heck out of having to take apart and change card positions to do straight thru or half and full normalling, and they too (the switches) feel solid and dependable. Don't waste your money on patch bays by higher profile "name" brands; get one or two of these instead.                
I have five of these in studio rack and they make life so much more simple with the ability to push a slider to select Normalled, Half-Normalled, or Through. They are not expensive but they do exactly what they are supposed to do, look good doing it, and you don't have to bother with flipping circuit boards and plgugs around to change it's function. The only thing I can think of that would improve them is a more detailed and easily understood set of instructions on what the purpose of Normal, Half-Normal, and Through are for and how better plan setting up a patch system that will work first time.                
Well a good patchbay should not introduce any sound. This one does not as far as I can tell and I use excellent headphones for reference.                 
The 3-Mode Multifunctional design is great although having the switches on the front instead of the top you think would be an obvious improvement. But having them on top does help protect your settings once mounted on your rack. I design my rack setup with an open space above and a cover for that slot - if I need to get to the switches it is pretty easy.                
If you understand what the switches are for, it is very simple to use.                
This piece of equipment seems to be built like a tank; heavy and the switches and jacks seem to be of high quality. The jacks work the way they should and are very smooth. Although I am using this in a studio, I would not hesitate to take it on the road.                
Great piece of gear for the money; I will add another when the time comes to upgrade my studio.                
Have not needed any                
It looks great and well built the design aesthetics go great in the studio and looks very professional.                
I would replace this with the same if it were to wear out. I would also buy another if I needed to expand.                
Just avarage. Cheap price, cheap product                
Behringer support is legendary to take forever and cost more than the product. For a price tag below $50, I'd consider it's a consummable.                
All the money you don't pay upfront (for a dbx, neutrik, hosa, tascam,...) you'll spend in hours crawling behind your desk/flight case stacks to check the connections, removing the unit from teh rack to check the switches (which are a good idea, but stupidly located and inaccessible as soon as the unit is racked)

the Behringer Q1002 is a great mixer the quality of its sounds reproduction far exceeds is moderate cost, you cannot go wrong with this unit.                
Great mixer. I record my radio program that has a mix of somgs and talk. Great sound. Easy to use.                
I just received my Behringer mixer and my Behringer wireless mic ..  and i immediately used it two day to dj a small wedding . Ok the mixer is good its solid and its compact so that's all very nice. The Behringer wireless mic has a good sound to it and if i have to say anything bad about its that the double A batteries drain somewhat quick but fortunatly i had a spare 4 pak so always carry batteries if your going to buy the wireless Behringer mic.   But so far its been a good purchase for me.                
I've always been a fan of Behringer products. Don't be fooled by the price tag - this mixer has a lot of bells and whistles, plus quality sound.  I use this one for my weekly podcasts and it works great.                
THE BEHRINGER XENYX USB MIXER IS GREAT I LIKE IT. IT'S VERY EASY TO OPERATE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT I HAVE AND OLD FASHION SOUND SYSTEM. BUT WHEN I DISCOVER ZZOUNDS OVER THE INTERNET, I TOLD TO MY SELF THAT THIS GUYS HAVE A GREAT DEALS ON SOUND SYSTEM, I HAVE TO TRY ORDER SOUNDS FROM THEM, SO I DID AND EVERY ORDER THAT I MADE CAME OUT RIGHT. I WILL ORDER FROM ZZOUNDS AGAIN AND AGAIN. HEY GUYS IF YOU NEED GOOD SOUND SYSTEM GO TO ZZOUND .COM GUARANTEED YOU GET WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR.THANKS FROM: "J AND J ALL IN ONE SOUND SYSTEM"                
I ordered this item as a repacked item...the only problem is when I got it...it was new...everything was there and it works great...
Fast delivery and always good service.                
I bought this for the good sound quality it has for vocals it really accents vocals much better than 2 other similar brands I tried with less feedback .Im using the digitech voice live 3 and you can get great sound with the two together even in a small space such as I have and have no feed back up close with vocal pedal and guitar fairly close ....for me sound is always first and for the money it cant be beaten.I did try the usb recording and had some ground issues but I cant say it was the device cause I have old wiring ...as far as shipping goes they are excellent the tracking is awesome and guitar center is a headache in that respect I have not had a good delivery with guitar center ...guitar center uses whoever is convenient...zzounds has proven stress free delivery.i know this isn't the best quality out there so I'VE give it a 4 star overall I would recommend to a friend . also I always keep plastic cover wrapping over it because dust kills these type of open faders and it doesn't overheat with be wrapped ...keep the dust out and you wont be disappointed...im only giving manufacture support a 2.5 cause I never used it so 50/50 seem fair                
I purchased this board due to how it talked up PC use. Once i received it. I found that nothing has been updated for PC use in a long time. OBS the most used Broadcaster and can't use this board without 3ed party plugins and Voicemeeter. But then it locks VoiceMeeter to only using the mixer and kicks out all other Voicemeeter settings.                
This little mixer is great. The features are very limited, but what is there is of a good quality. That is how it should be when you buy something on the value side - trade cost for features, not quality.
I like the compression on the XLR channel, and the USB connectivity is gold.  Recordings come through nice and clear.
Achieving zero latency was easy with a little hack. Google it and you'll see it can be done. The free Audacity software works great too.
Now that I purchased a larger mixer for some additional XLRs, this little guy will be a submixer. 
You can't go wrong with the 502usb in my opinion.                
This little mixer packs more punch than expected. I'm very happy with my purchase.                
I Bought This Mixer And It Works Good For What You Can Do With It Nice Compression Knob To Go With It Only Thing About It Is It Only Has 12 Vz Of Phantom Power So If Your Tryin To Use A Studio Condenser Microphone You Should Get A Seperate Power Supply                 
This was a perfect mixer to get my home studio organized. I have (believe it or not) three computers hooked up to this mixer. I needed a way to organize connecting all my home studio device with the ease of using an analog mixer. I use MOTU's Ultralite for my sound card driving Logic on my Mac. MOTU by itself is a mixer, but you have to go through the computer to control just about everything. That was horribly inefficient to do simple things (like tone and volume out of my monitor speaker). I have limited real estate on my desktop, so I couldn't get a big mixer in there. This notepad sized mixer was a perfect solution. Now everything is very easy to control. It sounds simple, but I have about 40 wires going back and forth between various devices. Just for organizing the wires, this mixer was heaven sent. I use all its inputs in the following way:Mic 1 -> Condenser MicMic 2 -> Mic 2 or Zoom G2.1U guitar pedal inputch3 & 4 -> MOTU Ultralite outputCh 5 & 6 -> Computer 2 audioUSB -> Computer 3 input/outputTape In -> extra CD player input (when you don't want to use computer CD drive)Output 1 -> Monitor speaker and subwooferOutput 2 -> Goes back to MOTU's inputPhone Out -> Goes to drive loudspeaker measurement hardwareFX Loop -> Goes to Lexicon Multi FXNow tell me if you can organize all this in a limited note pad sized space with anything else other than this. And you can imagine what a nightmare it would be to easily have everything connected in an organized way without it.The extra bonus is that the new mic preamp on this mixer really seems to sound good. Behringer has been saying, for a long time that their preamp is extra special super quality, and we used to laugh about it. But when I connected my condenser mic to this, I was shocked at how full, and bold it sounded. It's definitely few notches above my old Behringer mixer that I bought 10 years ago, and also Mackie that I have. I used to have Protools LE, and even compared to those, this mic preamp is good. I'm not sure if this was due to good matching with my microphone, but it's recommended that you try it out.The other channels are clear, but nothing to write home about. It quietly does its job, and is about what you expect from a hardware of this price range..When I got my mixer, I heard something was sliding inside the casing. I took the screws off, and removed the side panel to find out that an insulation glued on to either the chassis or the PCB that came loose and was sliding around. I removed it, and the mixer is working fine (probably until something hits its underside).I haven't played around with USB too much so far, so I can't comment on it except that it's working fine on the playback. When I get more usage, I'll write another review.I'm eternally grateful to Behringer for coming up with variety of mixer formats. Just look around, and you see what I mean. There isn't anything like this on the market, especially at this price. It was the nail in the coffin for my project studio, and I'm sure there are thousands more usage for it.Unbelievably good mixer for the price with surprisingly good mic preamp, and is recommended for anyone who's space or budget is limited.                
Great little mixer I can take anywhere. Good controls and works great with my Condenser Mic. Great price. Even better, zZounds' shipped so fast I forgot I order it. Great work folks, thanks!!!!!!                
I bought this mixer because it seemed like the cheapest way to get a USB audio adapter for my computer that had gain control on input and output, phantom power for a condensor mic, and a level meter. This mixer, minimally, provides all this but was ultimately not satisfactory. I ended up using a Behringer UCA222 in conjunction with my old Behringer MX802A mixer.Here are some general comments:o The overall frequency response, headroom and signal to noise levels are to a first approximation no better or worse than my several-years-old Behringer MX802A mixer -- The fancy new "Xenyx preamp" branding notwithstanding.o Via USB you at any time can either send audio TO or receive audio FROM the computer, but not both at the same time.o There are only four meter LEDs per channel which is barely enough to be useful if properly calibrated -- but they're not. When outputting the main mix to the computer via USB, the USB data starts clipping when the level is only part way through the third, yellow, LED's range. This is bad. It shouldn't clip unless the fourth, red LED is lit.o When you turn on the receiving of audio from the computer via USB there's a distinctly higher level of background noise present at the main output.o There is no power switch. You turn it on/off by plugging/unplugging the power cord into the back of the unit, and the pins on the connectors are hard to line up.                
I really enjoy the ease of use of this mixer. It is its own sound card, so you don't have to worry about that. The same circuitry as in their larger boards, so the quality is fantastic. I have it paired with a Sennheiser 421 mic and it does a great job. It also works well with Adobe Audition 3.0. Great product!                
Granted this was a cheap device but I had purchased Behringer products in the past and considered them to be of high value/low cost . I wrongly assumed this device was more than it was. Some key specs were left out of the product literature and while the hardware still seemed decent for the price, the drivers were hardly usable.
To enumerate the problems I have had:
* The device is 16-bit, though this was not specified on Behringer's site or any of the online retailers pages. 
* The device is USB 1.1, though this is also not specified.
* The default Windows USB Audio Codec drivers produced cracking at any acceptable latency when combined with ASIO4all v2 driver.
* The official Behringer WDM driver when combined with ASIO4all v2 decently low latency, but occasionally the audio would become momentarily distorted (once every 20 minutes or so).
* The official Behringer ASIO driver works perfectly at 5ms output latency, but Windows (non-ASIO) audio crackle and pop if the device is left at this setting after exiting my DAW.
* When operated with ASIO4all, the device is only available to windows meaning you can run only one ASIO application and sound through windows is unavailable. Granted this is a limitation of the Windows driver model and how ASIO4all operates with it, but I figure this is worth mentioning since Behringer links to this driver from its drivers download page.
* The official ASIO drivers do not allow many parameters to be tweaked. Cannot choose number of buffers and buffer sizes are only select-able in a predefined list. ASIO bit depth is hardcoded to 32 bit.
* There is no manual available, only a quickstart guide although the quickstart guide refers you to the manual for more information. 
* When I voiced some of these complaints to Behringer I was told that they couldn't help me, but they would let the guys in China know.
I did go through the normal troubleshooting process of choosing high performance power settings in windows, removing old drivers, turning off cpu power management, stopping unnecessary services etc., trying different usb ports and removing all but essential usb devices.  All of the above issues were experienced in Windows 7 64-bit on a moderately spec'd machine: Quad core phenom II @ 3Ghz w/4GB DDR2 ram.                
sounds very live and loud from the USB at 16/48, its max. Good headphone output, potentially ear melting.                
I have only had this board for few weeks, but so far it has been incredible! The FX are crisp and clean. The board functions easy to get use to and the USB option is excellent! I would recommend this board to anyone starting out and even to those that are experienced. Will be trying the recording feature soon at a live show, once i download the software!                
Im very happy with this mixing board, the sound effects are amazing and very easy to adjust and apply.i know some people put down behringer products, but i have quite a few and have only good things to say about this company, never had 1 problem with anything. as far as this board is concerned..it has made recording and playing so much easier and fun.the usb plugs right into the computer and play...that simple.the EQ sounds stellar and really makes a huge difference in the sound quality of my music. for the price, you cannot beat it...i totally recommend this mixing board to anyone who wants to increase the quality of there sound.                
Sound quality is great. It's used for various setups including acoustic open mic formats and small band performances. Very low noise in live applications.  Haven't used this at all for recording.                
Big advantage with this line of mixers is the compression. Second advantage is the configurable parameters of the effects.  Dual aux sends with fader is a plus as with the all mute button.                
Same type of eq as Berhringer's (and most others) powered mixers.  If you have a good handle on that , then dial in the compression so you can elevate the vocals on the fader to get level above the instruments.                
Been buying Behringer products since they were available here in the states. Have several processors, powered mixers, amps and DI's. Never had one single problem with a failure of any of them. My opinion: road worthy, great value for the money, reliable, predictable performance.                
It's a bargain.                 
Never had to contact them.                
I like lighted indicators, the more the better.  It helps in dark rooms.                 
If you use a powered mixer now, this is a nice transistional unit to the newer way of live sound.  Of course you'll need a power amplifier or powered speakers, but you'll gain much greater control over sound dynamics.                
My wife and I d.j. a lot of shows. The size and weight of the gear was getting way out of hand. We have switched to Beringer equipment. Twice the power, 1/4 the weight and our music sounds better then ever. The best part was the price. Check there gear out . You won't be sorry.                
I am an experienced karaoke host and have been doing shows for more than 10 years. I pride myself in providing the best user experience so I try to make sure they sound as good as they possibly can. I have been using my  Xenix X1222USB for 4 years and decided I needed a new mixer to ensure I had backup for my shows and a 2nd mixer for weddings etc. I'm now using th eX1222USB as my backup and just started using the QX model. 
I love the fact this mixer has USB sound. It gives a clear output and also allows me to record the singers at the click of a button using my CompuHost software. The compressors are great for the too soft and too loud voices at every show. The British EQ is great to tone the mics properly and all of the controls are smooth and well placed. The effects are better than the old ones on the x1222 and are a lot easier to use and adjust. It has a USB port for a USB fob type microphone receiver for the ULM-200 mics and I will be ordering them when they are available.                
This mixer performs well in the most important mixing task of being dead quiet. If you experience any unwanted noise, it would be coming from your cables, instruments  or some outside source of electrical interference.                
The built in compression and digital multi effects are a real bonus, especially at this price. They all sound great.  The EQ is excellent.  I do have some nitpicks on the features. The four mono inputs allow you to connect via XLR or 1/4" plug, but not both. It would be nice if they added an input select switch for those channels so you could use both inputs without changing connections. Although the built in effects sound great and all of the important effects you're likely to use are covered, I wish there was more flexibility in the adjustment parameters on some of them. It would be nice to have the ability to select at least a couple of effects and set them up in series or parallel. The multi-effects they provide are useful, but you are limited to a few preset choices. You can't save user presets, but any adjustments you make will remain if you go to another effect and come back. They don't automatically return to a default setting which is nice. I also wish there was a way of adjusting the viewing angle contrast on the display. It's hard to see what effect is active unless you are almost directly over the mixer. All that being said, the effects are very high quality and are a real bonus. You can always connect an outboard processor via the inserts for more flexibility, especially if you want different effects on different channels. There are separate mix controls on each channel for internal and insert effects.                 
I've been using a similar type of mixer for more than 30 years, so if I said really easy, it might not seem quite so easy to someone with little or no prior mixing experience. I still have to say as far as mixers of this type go, it is really easy to use.                 
This mixer appears to be very well made. The sockets are tight and the controls feel very sturdy. In a studio, there's nothing about it that would lead me to believe there would be any durability issues. If used on the road, a solid, fitted, foam-lined carrying case would be essential.                
This mixer provides a huge bang for the buck. The built in high quality effects are what really set this apart in this price range.                
Some of functions on this mixer are configured a little differently than my old mixer. I thought I had a couple of inputs which weren't working. I looked in the manual and tried all kinds of things with no luck. I e-mailed the company and got a response in fairly short order that immediately solved the issue. The person who responded was very friendly. This does lead me to one complaint. The manual covers four models of Xenyx mixers. Although they have a lot in common, there are distinct differences and it can be very confusing looking at information and illustrations which don't apply to my model. There should be a specific manual for each model. This may have prevented me from having to e-mail on a small issue I should have been able to easily find in the manual. A troubleshooting guide would also be helpful.                
Very appealing. Mixers like this are a basic utility for bands and anyone working with multiple sound sources. The wow on this would be the excellent built in effects.                
I bought this to replace a 30 year old mixer with a similar number of inputs and outputs. I made a good choice.                
I was using a Mackie 1604VLZPro from 2001 and it's footprint was way too huge for the space I had available in my new studio. So I went smaller plus I wanted an USB audio interface with the mixer. The QX1622USB was smaller than I needed but the price was right so I bought it. The first time I set it up and plugged in everything I could hardly wait to turn it on. That anticipation ended very quickly when I turned it on. There was a terrible hissing noise that I never got rid of. My Mackie didn't have it so I knew it was the Behringer. I tried everything to get rid of the hiss and even bought a tiny box designed to stop electrical static/ground noise bleeding into the cables from my PC. It's called a ground loop isolator. It worked pretty good so I thought it was my PC laptop that was making the noise because when I unplugged in the little box the hiss was less evident though not totally eliminated. Well, all of my recordings still had a terrible sibilant hiss during the quiet moments. But I lived with it for a year. During that time I noticed the faders (sliders) making crackling noises when I moved them. I always used a dust cover so I don't think it was dirt and debris making the noise. Then the left main fader began to crackle and eventually it failed almost completely. I could play with the fader and get some sound from it. After several months the entire unit was making all kinds of strange growling noises while playing my keyboards. After researching the problem it's a common complaint with Behringer mixers. I visited the Behringer website to see about the 3 years warranty but -- get this -- it's a 1 year warranty unless you register the product within 90 days, which I didn't and it's over a year old. So now it's a disposable mixer since it'll cost more to ship both ways and to get fixed. Happily I decided to buy a Mackie ProFX16v2 and I'm absolutely amazed at the pristine quality and 99% lack of sibilance even while wearing headphones! It's a joy! The Behringer NEVER sounded this good. And my Behringer B2031A Truth Active Monitors never sound as good either! I was rather disappointed with them and their sound until I bought the Mackie ProFX16 mixer! Please, if you're considering the QX line of mixers, I suggest otherwise. KEEP LOOKING. Buy anything else. Quality matters!                
This mixer is a great mixer for the money. It has a lot of great features like the compressors and equaliser. The lighting on the display could have been better its a little hard to read. But other than that I would recommend this to everyone.                
Behringer QX1832USB XENYX USB works great!!! I have been using it of over a month and love it.                 
For the most part this is a very nice little mixer with VERY low noise.  I'm using it as an external aux  EFX return Direct Out mixer to my main large format recording console.
The only problem I had with my new one was that when it was first turned on it made some funny loud noises, 2 mix LED ladder didn't work but after I turned it on a few times with the phantom power turned on it then worked fine and still does with no problems.  The delays sounds great but I thought maybe the Klark Teknik reverbs could've sounded a little better but they're usable in a mix.  
NOTE: What I wish mixing board manufactures would start doing is instead of having a mute button with it's associated LED just have a channel ON/OFF button with the LED indicator ON if you want that channel to work.  Then the board would have the LEDs  'ON' if you need that channel to work. Makes total sense and sense LED bulbs last virtually forever LED isn't really an issue. (plus the WOW factor would be a heck of a lot better! :)        
This mixer arrived quickly and works perfectly. It has a lot of features for the money. The effects are surprisingly good and the USB interface is great. I do wish there was a way to route the USB signal through a channel for EQ or effects. Anyway the mixer has been running 24/7 in a small theater for nightly shows without a hitch. Great value - thank you Behringer.                
I replaced a failed Mackie board with this one for our small church. I had only one day to install and set up this mixer before a special program for Christmas but it worked flawlessly. I am impressed!                
the sound is clean and give plenty of headroom and the effects are very good                 
the routing options and the eq/compression are useful but the wireless mic option is kind of a waste for me anyway                   
this is a pretty straight forward mixer you can have it up and running in no time                 
faders and knobs seem tight and well put together but we will see how it works in a year                 
very happy it has done much more than I expected well worth the cash                
no problems with any of behringers equipment I have as of yet                  
as far as mixers go it looks good ..and it has flashing lights  ooooooh                
originally bought this mixer as a add on to give more inputs for drums ,vocals etc. on our Tascam 24 track but with the clean sound and above level effects it has become the main mixer for recording . The 8 direct outs and sub outs give you all the routing you need. 90% of the mastering is done  using this board also. I set the track levels on the Tascam and route them back to the qx2442 for final effects and levels then use its built in usb to send a finished master to the pc for tweaking
Easy to set up is a to use                
Fun to play with easy to use                
I have three friends that use this model they love it                
It is a very good value I did not want a powered mixer                
Not yet                
This is a great product                
This is a very good measure                
Great mixer, I bought this one as an up grade from the x2222fx because of the usb and ability to record. It work awesome with my new Yamaha club series speakers and subs                
Very good                
It has a wireless mic option that might be okay if you can stay with in the 100 to 200 ft range? Other than that it's a bear bones mixer.                 
Very straight forward to use, anyone with any experience will have no issues using this mixer                
Very high quality good pots great sliders fit and finish very good. Has lots of ins and outs 4 chanel sub mixing, works well with other components just not with its self. Compressors little to no good, pre's okay. FX good, but I have outboard stuff.                 
The X2442 is cheaper and has all the connectivity, 3d sound, more for less, in my opinion.                 
They tried, my problem was that the product just wasn't capable of doing what I wanted. They informed of what it could do, and tried to blame my other equipment for its inadequaticys.                
Thought there was but I was wrong!                 
Good little mixer, works well but didn't realize it was so bear bones, all it does is mix ? The cheaper X2442 does way more and costs less, unless a 2 chanel wireless mic system that cost more than buying one is a peeling to you? It's lack of range makes it not a option for me.                 
Pretty decent. It's cheap behringer gear. What do you want, QSC for $200?                
Loads of touting capsbility. Excellent.                
Once you figure out the front panel, it's fine.                
Well, I would just be careful with it. Behringer pots have a way of just breaking off in a stiff breeze...from experience...                
Great value. Until it breaks from bringnlooked at too hard...lol...mine hasn't, but just saying...                
Never neededzzz                
Wow!!! It's still not broken after 5 gigs and a few rehearsals!!!!
The $300 rack case prob helps...lol                
Bought this to use as a keyboard/etc mixer for live gigs...had 3 synths, a headset mic, and a monitor return going into it, and separate vox and keys out to main mixer.  Behringer users know they pack every feature they can think of including the kitchen sink into all of their products, including loads of useless nonsense, but the routing capabilities are always appreciated. I have an out to one of my monitor speakers inputs, with my keys and vox, and another out carrying the main monitor mix to the other input on my speaker (EV ZLX 12)
Pretty handy. 
In fact, I even used it a few times as a main mixer for a 7 piece band rehearsal including V Drums and it worked out just great.
Only real complaints, first, as with all behringer sound reinforcement gear, it clips at ridiculously low input gain settings....it's why I avoid their loudspeakers, and two, the front panel is confusing and cramped. But you get used to it. For the price, it's great. Def recommend just for the routing.
FX are sufficient for basic stuff....Don't expect Lexicon and you won't be disappointed, lol.                
This mixer was purchased as an all purpose mixer for small venues. And a Drum Mixer for large venues. As part of my rack system, it goes where the show is. I have used this in 4 shows so far, it works like a charm. MY ONLY COMPLAINT, the power button on this rack mounted system is in the back.                
The mic preamps have fairly decent headroom and clearity for a drumset. Besides the hall reverbs, the rest of the effect are pretty good and clean sounding. I guess they chose to use the DSP for more bit rate rather than sample rate. So it's 24bit, but only 40 instead of 44.1.                 
I like that it has inserts on every channel to interface with my 8 channel sound card plus additional aux sends and return. No return level on those, but most external effects processors already have that. I wish there was a pre and post switch for those as they are pre only. Also, a larger VU meter. Other than that, it's perfect.                
It's very easy to use. They kept it simple. The trim is able to tame down hot mics with no attenuator button. There's no mid EQ but just the hi and low sound great and do the job..                 
I got a blemished sent back one, so some of the pots were tighter than others and the FX knob sticks sometimes. Can't complain for what I paid at all. Was easily fixed.                
Extremly awesome value. It's not a real professional mixer, but very close in many ways. Great job Behringer.                 
Never used it.                
There aren't many mixers like it or have the quality in sound. Also, the blue LEDs are always a wow.                 
I got this to work with an M-Audio Delta 1010LT and it worked out vey well. Use it for both recording and live.                
Great little mixer just wished it had a little more Eq options but, it works well for mic-in my drums.                
The only thing it doesn't have that I like to use is the Mids.  But it still produces a great sound for my shows.  I like the where the XLR connectors are located in the rear rather than where the EQ's are at.  It gives it a nice clean look and you never have to worry about having cables in the way.                
It's very light and gives out great sounds.                
The value on this is great                
I like the small space in the rack and the mixer sounds fairly good. But it falls short, if you want to use this mixer stand alone. The 2 band channel EQ doesn't give enough control over the tone. To get the sound you want, you will have to add a separate EQ to your rack. Also, the effects are terrible, so you'll likely add some external rack for vocal effects. And the most annoying short fall is the lack of channel mutes. I wouldn't buy this unit again!                
I use this line mixer as a sub-mixer to my main ROLAND M12E mixer. The sound of the BEHRINGER is totally transparent (the way it should be!), and I can't tell the difference between the sound modules/keyboards going straight into my ROLAND from those being sub-mixed first.                   
The handiest feature is the mute/defeat button on every channel. When I get confused about which module is in which channel, I can isolate them without adjusting the levels!
As a line mixer, it doesn't require EQ, so I don't miss that feature. On the two channel inputs for my ROLAND,I can alwasy fine tune the overall EQ for the BEHRINGER if required.                
I now own four different BEHRINGER products, and they all meet/exceed my expectations. A friend offered to sell me a ROLAND M120 line mixer (the same series as my M12E), but I did not like the gain/signal interface between the two, and they're both ROLAND! The stereo outputs of the BEHRINGER are very smooth and linear, and totally match the LED lights.                 
Brand new, this cost $40 less than a used ROLAND M12E currently advertised in a local music store! By the way, I have been totally happy with my ROLAND, although when purchased new about 8 years ago, it was $870 CDN funds.                
I haven't had to contact the company for any of my purchases, so I can't rate the support....what's wrong with that?                 
It looks great, is only 1 unit rack high, so it leaves me room for my other rackmount gear.                
If lost/stolen (Heaven forbid!), I'd replace it immediately with the same item.                
Generally great ... transparent and quite.                
Excellent mix of features for this type of unit. One thing to be aware of, though, is that the documentation says that the aux send is post fader from the factory. The manual documents a mod to make the sends pre-fader. WELL, turns out that from the factory, the unit is already pre-fader (and Behringer confirmed the error in their documentation). This is better anyway, but i didn't find out until after i'd chopped up my unit to make the mod ... doh!                
Generally good. Inside is very clean and durable.                
Couldn't expect much more for the price. The only thing i'd love to have is a tape out to plug into a recorder, but a y-cable on the main outs should work OK.                
Behringer was quick and helpful when i contacted them about the pre/post-fader issue.                
Sounds clean, however on my unit, if you turn the volume up past the half-point mark, it will make your synths sound harsh. Other than that it sounds great!                
Simple, basic, cheap and does it job well.                
plug the wires and the rest should be self explanatory                
Well made on the outside. But on top of the high's being too harsh, my unit right side reads higher than my left side. 
Other than those two things, this machine is great at what I purchased it for.                
You get what you paid for. Silly me for trying to run very expensive synths thru this unit. If your a bedroom producer, this machine is for you.                
Never used them.                
Has sex appeal, which is why I brought it.                
Overall, this machine is excellent at what it does. Like I said above, the unit sounds harsh once you get into the highs and mids and on my unit the right levels reads higher than the left.
If your looking for a good quality rack mixer to go with your quality synths, look to purchase an ASHLY LX-308B, a RANE SM82S, or a Speck X-Sum.                 
I bought this product for my drummer to use it as a mixer for his headphones, cause we are playing with some loops and a metronome. The mixer also has a separate mix for monitor (remember all inputs & outputs are 1/4", but are balanced so you can use an adapter to XLR if you want), which I am using with my wireless in-ear. It does the job and much more, plenty of headroom with the -40db +20 db switch in the back (if i remember correctly) and off course the price was great. I know some people dont think that Behringer is a good brand but I also own a powered speaker which works great and some other products as well. I've used and I also own other brand like Alesis, Yamaha and more, the quality of Behringer gets better and better, I am a 100% satisfied and with that price, nothing else comes close. Great product (s)
So far, I never had to use the Behringer support, so I cant tell, but i'll give them 5 stars, "innocent until proven guilty" :)
Found this product on eBay, but zZounds beat that price! Thanks again guys, you rock!                
I've had this for 3 years now. As a mixer, it does what the ad copy says it does. In real life, the mute buttons become intermittent and the pots get dirty. This leads to a loss of audio until you rotate the pots several times and push the mute buttons in & out repeatedly. Can be frustrating.                
I needed to expand the input capacity of my audio interface without spending thousands on an interface to support all my hardware hookups. This mixer gave me exactly what I was looking for in a very small footprint. I love having the mute buttons on the front and quick control of the pan/volume for each tracks along with the nice output level meter for the whole mixer really makes it great. If you need a good way to bring together a lot of inputs into one location, this is definitely something to look into. If I outgrow it in the future I will just add on another one! Doesn't color the sound or add any noise at all, which is perfect.                
This is a great rackmount mixer. I added this as a sub group mixer running my keyboards and other instruments. Then tied that into my main board and it is wonderful. Great sound smooth, no hum, or feedback at all. I will recommend to everybody.                
I used it on stage for quiet some time to mix down 4 synthesizers to 1 stereo channel. 
Recently I used it during recording session and was shocked what it did with my sounds. Some sounds where just mutulated (especially grand piano's, strings where ok-ish). And it had nothing to do with input volume. 
Looking for something more transparent now.                
Its easy compact and offers exactly what you need, no unneeded extra's. cant say anything else.
One drawback is that it has no smooth control knobs, they move in steps.                
very easy to use. Mostly due to its lack of complexity and options. But hey thats what you want for a line mixer in live situations right.                
so far pretty reliable except for the sound problems (see sound part of the review)                
Its cheap, but don't expect a clear, transparent and professional sound. Live it might be ok, but in a studio its a big no no.                
No idea. never needed to contact Behringer                
Kind of regret buying it now. Its not as good as Behringer wants you to believe. I am selling my Behringer linemixer now and buying a better quality one.                 
This mixer gives you a very nice, clean, and transparent sound.                
The mixer doesn't have eq and the effects are set to pre-fader unless you want to solder individual channels to post-fader.                
It has a solid build quality.                
This mixer is a great value if you just want something as a signal router.  EQ and a post-fader aux send would have made this mixer perfect.  I use this mixer as a submixer for a sound module, sampler, tape deck, and turntable.  I usually only record one track at a time so the fact that it's a stereo mixer doesn't matter.  If you have similar needs, this mixer is a great value.                
I haven't needed to contact them.                
This thing is not the best looking item in my rack but it is very functional.  If you take a look at other rackmountable line mixers, they're all like that.  I think mixers, on the whole (rack mount, console, desktop, etc.), are ugly looking components.                  
I really like this mixer.  I'd buy it again if it got run over by a truck.  You can get bogged down with all the bells and whistles of other mixers, but if you're like me and you record one track at a time, just need a good signal router or submixer, and you do your mixing on a computer with plug-ins, this mixer is the best you will find.                
The bass response was noticeably lacking between the audio going into and that coming out of the mixer.  The high end was brittle and higher insturments in the mix such as high hat were emphasized that hadn't been going in.  Overall, the sound was extremely flat and narrow, suggesting the possibility of crosstalk between the stereo channels.                
Having all stereo inputs is nice, but unfortunately someone decided to give this mixer stepped knobs, so you have a very limited number of possible volume settings with large gaps between each.  Also, the aux sends are permanently set to pre-fader and require soldering to change.                
Everything looks fine.                
I suppose that you get what you pay for with this cheap a mixer.                
I bought the S16 to help expedite Load in/out of venues and to reduce the amount of cabling my guys have to deal with.   Setup took only a few minutes and I was up and running.  I built a Cat-6 shielded cable with  Ethercon connectors and results have been perfect. It's nice to park the rack at the stage. Mics in, outputs feed the amp rack for mains and floor mons. The addition of the S16 to the X32 has trimmed about an hour off of setup and teardown. Behringer has certainly upped their game with the X32 and accessories.   I certainly don't miss hauling the big analog snake around!                
Hey there. I am writing this more as an informational piece than a review because I had some problems integrating the SD16 into my existing X32 with two S16 setup and I could not find any information at all online to help me. I called zZounds and they referred me to Behringer's tech support. Basically here is what happened. 
I bought the SD16 as a way to have another drop on the opposite side of the stage. Currently my two S16's are mounted in my amp rack so I need to run cabling across or behind the stage to get to it. When I hooked up the SD16 as the last unit in the chain, the system did not recognize it at all and I had no control over it. The kicker was (and this is what threw me initially) the AES50 lights on my second S16 and the SD16 were solid green telling me that the setup was synced. At that point I started thinking that maybe I needed to update the firmware in my X32 in order to use the SD16. I bought the system together back in 2013 and really haven't needed to do any updates. 
The system has worked flawlessly since I got it. I went ahead and updated the firmware (from 2.5 to 2.16) and that still did not fix the problem. Here is where it gets really interesting. I started to think maybe there was a problem with the B port on my second S16 so I disconnected everything and hooked straight to the SD16. The X32 picked it up perfectly. No issues. I then hooked up the SD16 as the first box in the chain (X32 to SD16 to first S16 to second S16) and again it was picked up by the X32 and worked perfectly. The routing screen on the X32 showed the SD16 and both of the S16's.  I then thought maybe there was a problem with the second S16 in general  so I hooked up the first S16 to the SD16 and the same problem occured. Only the S16 showed up on the routing screen. 
This is when I called zZounds to see if they could help and they sent me to Behringer. The first tech I talked to at Behringer thought that maybe I had a bad cable so I swapped out all of the cabling and that did not fix the problem. I called Behringer again. The second person I talked to knew exactly what the problem was. Back at the end of 2014 there was a firmware update that was released for the S16 boxes that was not widely publicized. Also, as a side note, without having the S16 connected via USB there is no way to tell what firmware version you are running. I was on 1.1 and the new firmware is 2.2. I downloaded the new firmware (which has a PDF file telling you how to do the update) and ran it on both S16's. Everything works great now. 
The X32 sees everything and I have full control over the SD16 as the last box in the chain or wherever I decide to put it in the chain. I hope this helps some of you that might be having this same issue. I realize that many of you are probably running newer systems than I am but like I said earlier, I could not find ANYTHING on this issue ANYWHERE. Even in the Behringer forums. I'm pretty sure there are quite a few people out there running older firmware because unless you are using the X32 in a studio situation, most of the firmware updates that I have seen apply more to the studio environment that the live environment (which is where I am using my system). I hope this helps a few of you out there.                
I really like this little guy.  It's built like a tank, dead easy to setup and does what it's supposed to do. The XLR inputs are also much more durable than the locking ones on the X32's and the S16 stage boxes.  The built in Hi-Z inputs on the last two channels are a nice touch too and have eliminated two DI boxes from my setup.                
You can not go wrong for the price. This unit is truly well built with features and a sound you expect to pay double or even triple the price.                
It has 3 selections I like the middle position the best the top position is good and the bottom position is a boost and it works well kind of like a overdrive it boosts your signal. for those leads.                
4 knobs to twist and a 3way switch. COOL! /it is very good fuzz in my opinion, I have owned and/or own a big muff pi, fuzzbrite clone of fuzzrite very good no bass fuzz, I like the behringer because it has great high and low control and it sounds lik to me the fuzz sound I  was looking for.                 
Pick a selection 1,2 or3 and set up you tone and rock out!                
Not bad for plastic, hey i dont jump on my metal stomp boxes why would I do it to this one. Treat it good and it will treat u good.                
Best bang for your buck!!!!!!!!!!                
i dont know never needed them and I own 8 of them no problems                 
VERY SEXY PEDAL!                
BUY IT NOW!                
 I am a commercial sound system engineer and professional radio and mobile DJ and have designed audio equipment in the past. I own many different Behringer small format mixers and signal processors (including compressors, crossovers, eqs and exciters) which I bought over the years going back to the late 90s. I still have and use most of these products, they are rugged, reliable, have excellent specs and work flawlessly. It amazes me how Behringer consistently offers such top notch products with so much bang for the buck. I believe they are unique in their market segment.
 Overall, my early opinion of the new SPL3220 is equally favorable. I ran it through it's paces with commercially recorded music like that I would play on the air or at a gig and found that with it's dual band design it does a commendable job of taming dynamic volume swings and holding average program levels without the artifacts typical of the many single band processors available. It's packed full of useful features despite it's small size and price like the leveller, limiter, full metering, hard bypass, music or voice settings, and unbalanced or balanced XLR combo inputs/ outputs. Most of all, it's logically laid out and easy to operate despite it's complexity of functions. It should be invaluable for uses like mine or in PA and background music systems, production studios or for small broadcasters on a budget.
 My only reservations or nit picks concern the front panel design and lack of good documentation (owner's manual). The front face has an attractive hinged smoked plastic cover which may be prone to breakage by tampering, heavy use or impact. It also obscures the controls and meter illumination to a great extent. I prefer the more typical Behringer extruded aluminum open front face design. I think the unit should also come with a more comprehensive User's Manual as has been traditional for the company. This is a complex piece of equipment (albeit deceptively simple in control layout) which deserves more detailed background and useage information especially for those unfamiliar with compressors / limiters / levellers. I myself had to look at the block diagram on the specification sheet which i found on their website (under downloads for the unit) to understand the actual functions of the "Meter" and "Program" switches and "Leveller" knob. The "Meter" switch acts as a processor in/ out selector (it's actually a bypass), the "Program" switch selects the crossover frequency between the two processor bands (favoring either voice or music uses), and the "Leveller" knob increases the recovery time of the compressor effectively keeping the average program level consistent over a longer period of time.
 For the price and features of the SPL3220 though, you won't find a better product out there, that's what's so great about Behringer. I heartily recommend it.
It is a wonderful processor allows a lot of punch and great presence but I wish it had gating and more user adjustable controls.                
If you're looking for analog audio processing, it would be wise to completely pass on this product. Normally I really like Behringer gear, but not this piece. If you're looking for analog audio compression, limiting, or AGC (Automatic Gain Control), check into some of the older gear that really works, like the Aphex 320A Compellor, Aphex 720 Dominator II, Symetrix 422, or any of the DBX compressors. I had found that the Eurocom SPL3220 almost did nothing to the signal. It's too bad, as Behringer could have really come up with a box that was a powerful tool, unfortunately, they went in the opposite direction.                
The sound quality for this unit is awesome considering its price tag. It has much better sound quality (a much lower noise floor) than I have ever been able to get with a high quality computer sound card.                
The entire unit as a whole is a 'swiss-army' knife. Have not used the emphasis though. The SCMS removal is nice - it allows old consumer DAT-tapes to be redubbed. Analog RCA Inputs and outputs would be nice to add though.                
Use two of them back-to-back to send 2-channel stereo SPDIF audio through a building's CAT5 Ethernet cabling without picking up any AC hum or distortion. Very easy to use - no learning curve needed. Plug it in and your done.                 
Ask me that a year from now. The unit seems to be well made - has solid extruded aluminum rack mounts that will hold the unit securely in a rack. The buttons and switches seem like they will hold up.                
It's a great price thats affordable for starting musicians, which I believe that it's perfectly priced for this group of people who are most likely to buy this kind of equipment.                 
Easy to understand and use. Did not buy it for looks, but it's LED layouts and controls are easy to see and use.                
I can't see A/D - D/A conversion ever growing obsolete, especially with it's low noise floor. I wish I knew about this unit earlier.                
Best sound-to-dollar ratio DAC in the world?  Maybe. It does sound every bit as good as a Benchmark DAC1 even when driven with a cheezy S/PDIF signal from a cheezy consumer sound card.  I'm impressed.  I really didn't expect this much performance for the price.                  
It does everything.  DAC, ADC, SRC, digital patchbay- And the connectivity leaves me wanting nothing.  It even has a decent, though not great headphone pre.  I don't know of another product that has this feature set and all of this connectivity.                
Some of the lights and buttons could have been labeled with better, more appropriate and intuitive terms, but I'm used to it.  Took about a day for me to be 100% confident in using it, now it's a no-brainer and I use it with zero lag on my part.                
It's typical behringer, of course.  Dubious chinese build quality all the way.  Cheesy connectors, case and controls.  I wouldn't want to depend on it for a mission critical project, but for my own home use I'm 100% satisfied..As long as it doesn't catch on fire!                
I'd give it a 12 here.  Again, nothing else I know of does all this for 10X the price.                
I've had it a week, haaven't needed support.                
No sex appeal IMO.  Again, it's typical Behringer.  But the practicality and features made me want it and now that it's here, I'd never want to let it go...Well, when better chips come out I'll sell it.                
I still can't believe it retails for $129 and Behringer AND the retailer both make proffit.  Amazing.                
It's completely silent.                
It gets the DA/AD out of my PC.                
It's a little tricky to set up sometimes. It has forgotten its settings once in a while after a power cycle. But I usually set it and forget it.                
It's never given me any reason to doubt its quality.                
Worth every penny.                
Never had to deal with it.                
Prevents your recordings from sounding like a complete amateur.                
I've had this for several years, and it is great. It's totally silent, and totally reliable.                
The best I've heard so far... big step above my soundcard                
Great features but I wish it had rca outs                
Pretty straight forward                
Heave duty metal construction                
Considering it used to be $400 and now is $129 great deal                
good thorough manual                
Definately looks impressive matched up with my tube amp                
Great deal one of my  best audio purchases                
I am using the SRC 2496 to convert analog audio sources to digital for use in a high school television production studio. Always mindful of financial issues, this equipment has far exceeded my expectations for the cost. It is a great value.                
Gain can be adjusted for analog, but cannot cut/boost for digital.  If digital signal is high, a little distortion may be introduced.  I don't particularly find the "emphasis" all that useful, but your mileage may vary.  It's probably more intended for analog; I should read the manual.                
Top ratings because it does what it is advertised to do; nothing more, nothing less.                
No wall-warts.  This will stay in a rack in the studio.  I cannot attest to its durability on the road, although I don't know why anyone would take it with them.                
For digital-only connections, you'll get more features than the only other item in the price range, the ART DI/O.                
Haven't needed it, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.  However, I wish I didn't have to pay internation postage for the registration card.                
Behringer products look ... like Behringer products.  Surprisingly, aesthetically much better than the older SRC2000.  Of course, not even close to t.c. electronic in visual appeal, but it does what it is supposed to.                
I'll use this until it burns out.                
No difference to highend contenders...                
so many features in one slim module. awesome                
The manual is crap, should be rewritten from scratch.
Better to not read it and just start using: operation explains itself after several trial-and-error sessions                
The only minor quirk: mine gets switched on by an external power switch and sometimes resets some of its previously stored settings (like: digital input chosen last time used)                
no alternative on the market                
Not needed...                
I wanted it - and I own it                
The ADC section is quite clean and flat sounding, with a low noise floor.                
It might occassionally be nice to have standard unbalanced inputs like RCA or TS. Otherwise its got all the features I can imagine needing.                
Although I have heard others claim that Behringer's products are not reliable in their first release, I have never had anything go wrong with this or the other Behringer product that I own.                
This is a good value. The clean sound and the extensive features are pretty impressive given the price tag.                
Don't know how their support is because I never needed it.                
This is a practical unit that solves problems with different sampling rates, and converts to and from digital. It's not the kind of thing that has sex appeal. You buy it for its features.                
For a lot more money you can probably get a slight increase in dynamic range, a tiny bit less jitter, etc. But for anything less than a perfectionist, this is a great product at a great price, and I've been happily using it to make recordings.                
I am impressed. :) Amazing sound quality. Great frequency separation. Lots of power. Solid Monitors. Love them. And the price cant be beat. Get em.                
Incredible. Sound quality is amazing. Incredibly loud too, gotta turn them down when switching from other monitors. Got this along with stands and isolation pads and was able to pay 4 different payments, zZounds is by far the best dealer.                
Very satisfied with these speakers, they sound so clean!                
I do not know if there was something wrong with the pair I got of if it is an inherent poor design. However they picked up interference from everything and were so noisy they could not be used. Lights, WiFi, computer hard drive, power wires and even cars going by caused them to growl snap hum whirl etc. I even got mors code sounds coming over them. Secondly if they are to be used on a table in a recording situation they need to have covers or grills. It would be way to easy to push anything on the table into them and puncture a speaker. The sound when I did hear it was flat and they need volume controls. I am very disappointed in them.                
I think it sounds good. We are a church choir that sings at various venues. We have some other components that I would like to replace for sound issues, but not this board.                
It does everything I need for a group of 7-9 singers and 3-6 instruments.                
The controls are simple and intuitive.                
I had one input channel go out shortly after purchase, but I think it was my fault, over drove it a lot on accident and probably fried something. Never bothered to try and get it fixed because we were OK with one less channel most of the time. Otherwise it stands up to moves from location to location very well, still in the original cardboard box. Probably time to get a better case.                
I think the price/feature ratio on this thing is great. I use the FX processor a lot and it works great.                
I don't really know, never had to use it.                
It is clean, compact and very functional!                
We've had it for 3+ years and will keep it as long as it keeps going.                
This is a great little board for the $.                
I would give it a 10, but feel it needed more Aux sends for my needs.                
Super easy to use, right from the box.                
This is a great little board, built well, and rugged.                
I selected this board because it is the best "bang for buck" period.                
Have had no problems, but anticipate no issue with support due to the quality of the mixer for the $                
The small format makes this a great modular component piece.                
I'll run it till it quits turning on, then probably order another or the newer version.                
This mixer sounds great for the price.                
The effects on this are great.  I have had high school rock bands come and ask me if I could change how their voice sounds.  I also use this in the studio and the presets are great.                
This product is as easy as plug and play.  It takes me 10 min to hook this up.                
The knobs are all different.  Some stick some you don't need to touch to turn.                
I have not used the support yet.                
I think it sounds great, and it does everything that we need it too. The only thing I would like to see change is for the sound person to have controll over the echo amounts. He has to turn the sound down to avoid getting too many echos.                 
everything is great                 
very easy to get sounds. What zzounds needs to do when selling it is to tell the customer who does not have experience that he/she needs a power amp to make it work.                 
made great.                 
I only saw it sell for 10 dollars less than what I paid for it, but I did not have to pay for shipping, which made the diffrence up.                 
very                 
all the sound effects it gives                 
I would replace it ASAP.                 
Significant crosstalk, especially with strong signals.  The effects don't sound all that great.                
They crammed a ton of features into this board!
Faders and knobs are not very smooth or consistent. Signal indicators only light when signal hits about 0dB, unlike Mackie and Allen & Heath boards that have a meter bridge-like single indicator LED that illuminates at different intensities. As mentioned above, the 99 effects are mediocre, but there are two distinct channels/processors!  Could be some more aux sends.                
No complaints here!                
Immediately after I powered up the first board, the effects system started blinking like crazy and sending hissing, distortion, and clicking out the mains, even if I lowered all the FX knobs, master fader. There was no way to stop it (power cycling, holding both effects knobs in). The second board was fine. I returned the first board to guitar center with no problems. The replacement board worked great for 25 days until the same thing happened again!  Found other people with the same issue on some forums.
I would have been able to get past the drawbacks in some of the features, but I can't live with the chance of the effects crapping out again and lots of repairs in the future.  Let me be clear. The board is unusable if the effects systems fails.                
I decided to return BOTH boards to buy two Mackie CFX20 mkIIs. I had bought these Behringers for $499 ea and I decided to drop the extra 500 bucks to get the Mackies at $749 ea.  I'd say that the extra $500 is worth the long term investment for my church.  These get used at least 3 times per week, sometimes every day.  Got extended warranties too.                
Not used.                
Behringer has done a great job with the appearance of their products.                
I have to rate this so low because of two of the same failures in two new boards within 30 days.  If Behringer built a better effects system, these would be GREAT entry-level boards.  Spend the extra dough for Mackie or Allen & Heath.  I wish I did from the start!                
It's not a cadillac but it does the job I've had mine for two years 
we play 3 nights a week i have had no problem so far I do'nt understand why people complain so much for the price it's a good deal, do they know what the are doing                
best deal for the price                
I                 
It'nice and compact                
I think I'll be using it for a long time                
I bought this board to give me the room I need to do a full band.  I have a 12 channel Peavey, which I now hook up to one of the stereo channels, giving me a board for just percussion.  I love the versatility, low noise, optional plug-ins.  I can either go amped, or powered speaker, and the gains remain dead spot on.  Not much change from non/phantom power characteristics.  My only bad on this is the bleed through of the effect channels overrunning the pan/left/right sub-channels.  I like complete mutable control with one slide, and the orange knobs take that away.                
Really Great piece of equipment, easy to use and set up great effects and reliable                
The effects are awesome                 
Friendly Usefull                
Graet quality on design and manufactured                
Great price for what you get                
All the support of the world came with it.                
Is really loveable, design and look                
I believe is one of the best mixing consoles I ever use                
This board allows you to do a lot with it and if you know what your doing and know how to run sound this gives you a lot of board for the value.  This board has a lot of head room and channels are quite.  The only problem I had were the FX did not function but it was a blemished unit.  Had to send back and get another board.                
The Behringer SX2442FX Eurodesk works great in the studio.  Very quiet mixer and versatile.                 
I have been using this mixer for a few weeks in my job as soundman and it has never let me down. I have this one, the 32 channel version, a xenyx 2442 and a Yamaha MG series mixer that I use regularly. While I cannot recommend the Xenyx line for front line use, the Eurodesk line is ready for use in clubs, bars, churches and even at outdoor events. I have used mine at all these types of events with no issues whatsoever. Reliability and predictability of the gear allows me to concentrate on keeping levels straight and making sure nothing gets into the red and this mixer does that. The Xenyx one however, is prone to making noises you can hear through the speakers when you click buttons like PFL/AFL. I actually like using this mixer now because I know where all the buttons and faders I need are located and it has never failed me or even faltered. The sound is transparent as it should be and I have received many compliments (not on the gear) on the sound of the mix acheived using the mixer and Behringer DSP and amps. Some of the other soundmen seem honestly surprised to hear a clean mix come from this gear. It would have to be a pretty bad mixer for it to ruin my mix by itself. Overall it is quite good when used in a live situation. Sometimes I use the Yamaha mixer and QSC powered speakers on the job instead of this and you cannot tell the difference.                
Purchased for my church and was very impressed with the sound quality, number of channels, easy set up and flexibility. I have hooked up a QSC qx5 and powering two Yamaha 2-way speakers and Peavey monitors. Im well pleased with this product. dont understand how people continue to complain about this board especially for the price!!!!                
I bought this mixer because our band is growing, and we all decided to invest in upgrading our equipment. This looked like a great board, all the channels plus two effect engines sounded awesome. After getting this board and unpacking it, it lasted about 4 hours and the effects started to go on and off by themselves, cutting the sound on and off as it did this. It was very strange as I messed around with volume sliders trying to figure out why my sound died and then all of the sudden the sound kicked back in with the volume being way to loud, blowing the horns on my JBL speakers. Anyway the mixer finally just quit working all together after only owning it a few hours, the two effect engine lights remained off, and no sound at all.  I did some research and found this to be somewhat of a common problem that people have complained about. My question is; If this has been an issue for the last several years, why has Behringer not addressed this problem? my suggestion is don't buy it. Not only did I have to return it, but I had to get my horns repaired on my JBL speakers as the result of this product being faulty. zZounds was very good at the return, and I ended up going with a Mackie Profx22. It really looked like a great mixer, but I will be very hesitent to ever buy anything from Behringer again.                
Behringer products are great, until you touch them. I bought this console on a dare, and my friends are paying me back in installments.  The preamps are solid in construction, if you are talking about the construction of a light souffle! Use a feather or a toothpick to move the faders because seriously the wiring in this thing is 1 molecule thick and built by cheap nanobots.  If this console existed in space, operated by a weightless, invisible hand, it would be spec-perfect to a more expensive Mackie or comparable mixer. However, we live on Earth, where components need to resist stress, and last over time.  Everything you have heard about Behringer is true. It works, but all of a sudden, it doesn't!                
All the bells and whistles.                
A clone of a much better product.                
Shoddy components. Cheap plastic things all over it.                 
If you need something for one session and can't borrow something from a friend, buy this, use it once, and throw it in the trash. Your signals will be thin and compromised, but who can't fix it in the mix? I give this a big 2 fir Behringer's constant devotion to spot on mimicry of reliable products.                
You can't get them to help you. They just make things for beginners to use. It's a joke that they are manufacturing products at this high a level.  It's like getting a Formula 1 car from Yugo.                
It's like getting a fake Rolex. Need I say more?                
What a stupid idea. Seriously, what musician or engineer with any self respect would buy anything from this company except for a small accessory or a quick fix? No one with any sense would make a major purchase from this company.                
There is no downside to the sound of this board.  The preamps are transparent and quiet, special effects work great, plenty of headroom...everything you ask a mixer to do for your sound is there.  Making vocals and instruments sound the way they go in is extremely important, and this board is that way.  You can, however tweak everything to get whatever "version" of those sounds you want.                
It would be nice to have two more pre-fader sends, but at this price-point the existing feature set probably makes this too costly. By getting the 24 xlr versin, I create a third mix using the inserts to patch over to other unused channel line inputs.  Then I assign those to a subgroup or two and not to the mains.  The faders can be used to create the third or even fourth mix with some creative experimentation.  Direct outs could be good, but the inserts can be used as d/o, and for me it's enough.                
intuitive, well grouped controls.  well written manual, although I have previouss mixer experience.  I don't think anybody quite matches mackie in this department...user friendly manual, that is.  Behringer Online support is there for any questions. I can't think of an easier way to add a subwoofer than to use this mono out with adjustable volume and adustable lpf...in conjuntion with the adjustable hpf on my behringer eq...unbelievable difference in the clarity and power requirements of my system from this one feature.                
everything is perfect out of the box.  The controls are firm, with the faders the least firm, but very smoothe and controllable.  The fit and finish is on a par with everybody else...just fine.  I am not the least bit worried about the "horror stories" as they have simply become urban legend on the web.  My own personal experience with behringer, and local music store information has laid all these stories to rest around here.  How long will it last?  I don't plan to throw it arouns, so I expect years of usage.                
Hands down winner here.  Nothing else is even close.  You will find some used boards with more sends, but fewer channels, new boards with less of everything, any variation in-between.  Pound-for-pound, dollar-for-dollar..this board has more of the typical weekend-warrior needs covered for less money.                
I have never needed any supports except for simple questions...always a prompt, courteous response.                
It's gorgeous...maybe not exactly like the onyx is gorgeous.  A little more of a retro-gorgeous.  It is not, BTW a close cosmetic copy of the onyx if you are an observent person....a little siver here and there doen't make them look alike in my book.                
I have no inkling to look for a different mixer.  I shopped for 6 months and did extensive research to determine if the internet babble on three very vocal forums was really the majority opinion.  It is not. It is also not based on current information regarding behringer products or business practices. I bought this mixer because I am an educated consumer who knows what I want and what it's worth.  My music sounds better, my bands needs are now met, and this mixer is a key ingredient.  The common recommendation for a small mixer with 16 inputs and 6 sends is around $1000.  That is simply not a player for many folks.  Neither is a legitimate need or technical ability to use 6 sends. This board had 24 mono channels and so many routing options, a competent sound person will find the sends more than adequate for the weekend gig band.  I'd replace it with another one...or add a 2442fx or some xenyx version if the need for a monitor board ever arose...that beside this would be capability well beyond any reality I see in my forseeable future.                
I was very very surprised with this board. The first thing I did was have a custom flight case made for it by Islandcases out of New York and is a great flight case. This board is absolutely underrated. I use Mackie, Yamaha and Soundcraft boards and this board is every bit as good. It has a lot of head room and I like the fact that you can assign the onboard graphic EQ to the auxiliary buses. We use along with this board DBX's Driveracks. AS with anything as long as you take care of it and don't beat it to death it should last a long time. Behringer has come a LONG way. The 24 xlr channels are plenty and the sound is very clear. The British EQ's work exceptionally well with the DBX DriveRacks EQ. The effects are adequate but in all honesty this board would be better without them, it's just one more thing to go wrong and that's with any unit.                
No accessories except for the power  chord. As stated above the effects are adequate but the board would have been great without them as well.
I do wish there were optional gooseneck lights that could be connected to it.                
You will have to read up on this unit to get the best out of it.                
This board is well made. I'm starting to believe in Behringer products. I know their power amps are workhorses and absolutely great. That is the main reason I took a chance on this board. As long as it stays in it's case and not thrown around it will last a long time. It is nice and lightweight. It is road worthy and has been holding up.                
I got it at an EXCEPTIONAL deal. It is worth what the website has it listed for. I would another one if needed.                 
I'm not rating it because I haven't had to use it. I do need to email them about a question I have so we'll see how it gets handled.                
really no sex appeal just a very good mixing board.                
I should be using this board for sometime. IF anything I would look for a bigger board. IF it were stolen I would buy another one just like it. Behringer add optional gooseneck lights!!!!lol                
Actually, all those who complain about Behringer's quality they don't have even a single DI for themselves, in most cases... They just "talking" and they are very sure that can accuse Behringer, because it's just a cheap one company and its very easy to say : "It's Behringer and thats why it's bad...". When they ask for me to rent them my PA system for a live gig, they want to have the Nexo PS15, a Midas mixer, Neumann mic's, etc, and they want to pay 150$ for one night... Well for all those "i know everything and i want the best" guys, i have to tell this : The last 2 years Behringer make some new models that they are REALLY good, just like the Xenyx series. I have 3 Yamaha's digital mixers and 2 Xenyxs and some times i prefer to work with the Xenyxs. I will never buy a Mackie, a Soundcraft, or whatelse insted of a Xenyx. Period.                 
Everything is here. Many more features than others mixers in this category. Very good, very good, very good....                
If you know to work with a pro mixer, you don't have to take even a single look in the manual.                
As far as you power it on and still works it's just fine.                
If you have psychologicall problems when viewing the Behringer's logo, on your gear, take this tag out and put a Mackie one on. Then you gonna have it all...                 
I want to pay and buy something that will work fine and give me back some money. I don't want to pay Mackie's new factory, or the brand new Ferrari of Mida's chief president... After all they are all machines, it's not the meaning of life.                
This mixer works great, I'm picking up the features pretty quick, but theres still a TON that I have to learn. I bought this mixer for my studio, and I havent gotten to use it much with an entire band yet, but that will come later this year. So far I'm very happy with it. The knobs feel nice and firm, the sliders not quite as firm but still not bad at all. The buttons work well, and the effects processors do their job. the sound is really good with my rocket 5 studio monitors, and the whole thing is very quiet.                
The only thing I do not like about this board is it does not have monitor controls for individual channels. If I would have known that I would have went up a step. It wasn't clear about that and the picture wasn't large enough to see that by looking. Would really like to trade for the 3200.                
I bought this mixer only to find out a few months later it dropped channels. I had to pay to ship it to be fixed and when I got it back found out it had lost a group channel as a drummer this was a problem! I will never buy Behringer equipment again.                 
If you are a pro audio guy, like i am.. This thing is junk. if you are a young band looking for something to get you through. this will work well for you.                 
The built in effects are good to have. don't sound too bad.
The pre-amps suck! you have to push it to the limits if you are a loud music group.                
Easy to hook up and use. not a whole lot of Aux outs, but for a small venue, it would work.                
It is a disposible piece of gear. It's cost is great, but repairs cost more than just replacing it. Use kid gloves with this unit.                
The price is right for a toy... cause that is all this is. Learn on it and move on.                
What support!                
The best $25 I have ever spent on my guitar in nearly 30 years. Amazing pedal, it is a shameless copy of a Sans Amp pedal and it shamelessly does it with awesome accuracy. You can't beat this thing with a bat on the price. It's worth 3 times or more that easy. I have a variety of modelers and distortion boxes from Line 6, Digitech, Boss and E.H. even  a couple of stupid priced boutique pedals, this is as good and better than most of them at any price. I have bought a small handful of Behringer pedals recently and they have all found their way into my live rig, the Echo Machine the Reverb Machine and the Shifter/Harmonist are also very note worthy pedals. I don't know how they do it but from what I have heard I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone, they are an incredible value. As for being made of plastic, so what, it's not like I jump up and down on them, they seem very study and reliable.                
great distortion sound                
mode switch actoin a plus                
duh                
its made of plastic but i had this pedal for almost a year brought it to about 5 playouts and had no problems,course i leave this guy on the whole time!!!                
awesome value,most boxes like this would cost over 90 bucks!!!                
no support needed as of yet                
nice sound great price!!!                
great pedal for the price!!! goes great with my bugera 333 infinium half stack                
It has a warm tube-like sound.  It is very versatile, great marshall, mesa, twin tones.  I run it through a tube amp and a 2x12.  Thick with tons of distortion.                
It has mic placement, different gain positions and responsive bass and treble controls.                  
Easy to get great tones in minutes.                
It has a plastic case so I woundn't jump on it, but it has lasted for the past 5 months no problems                
It is a clone of SansAmp GT-2.  but it cost 75% less.                
never had an issue.                
It is the Jcm900 tone I was looking for.                
I would buy one every month if I needed to.  If it had a metal case it would be perfect.                
The TM-300 gives you a full guitar preamp with bass & treble, master volume and overdrive, and a variety of amp models for $25, which is astounding. You can plug straight into a powered speaker or a PA and get a true guitar tone without having to haul another amp along. It doesn't have the digital delay effects of a Line 6 Pod or a V-Amp, but it does the job conveniently and cheaply in a way that makes it a near necessity for live shows.                
This is a hidden gem AT ANY PRICE!! If the price seems to low. go get the trans amp version of this pedal it cost way more. This is a real deal. IT doubles as a di box or distortion pedal and the tweak ability giv it a wow factor.  I would get it again in a heart beat if i had to. yes its plastic but hey its priced rite.                 
When the description for Behringerâ€™s TO800 Vintage Overdrive pedal mentions the 4558 IC I know they're referring to the chip used in what I consider one of the most iconic pedals in Guitardom. Clueless? Weâ€™re talking about the TS-808, TS9, TS10, TS7, TS5, etc. The TS series is the most collected, written about, and modified pedal out there. I was a relative late-comer to TS mania and it was the early 90â€™s when I got a TS5. Itâ€™s the same circuit as the original but cheaper components, a plastic case, and itâ€™s not a collectable, but it produces the same soft clipped harmonic distortion that the early versions are lauded for. Jump to present and Behringer who produces inexpensive clones of many popular pedals. With my curiosity killing me, I ordered the TO800 and it arrived in two days. I hooked up the TO800 and my TS5 and A-Bâ€™ed them at the same settings. Shazaam, shazaam! I canâ€™t tell the difference. The Behringer TO800 nails it! Yes the case is plastic and battery cover removal is a bit quirky but I use it with an external supply and I donâ€™t throw or drop my pedals. Get â€œthe soundâ€ for a song and a dance.                
Simply a no brainer at this price. After reading many reviews, I gave it shot and was blown away. I put it side by side with my buddy's TS9 and it was virtually identical. The difference was placing the drive past 9 O'clock. At this setting it has a little more distortion which gives it an almost two in one effect. While the TS9's metal casing will hold up longer, I find no reason to spend $80 more for it. The plastic casing is of high quality industrial strength and I have kicked the dung out of it and it has held up. I have a Tubulator MTE-1 which I dislike and never use but decided to use it in unison and the sounds that I can get are amazing. I am running it through my Super champ X2HD and cabinet on the straight tube clean channel 1 and it has turned it into the most versatile amp I have ever had. Behringer has come along way and they are making some good stuff now. Buy this pedal and it may be the best $20 bucks you've spent.                
Of course everyone will compare this with the legendary Tube Screamer. Well let me tell you it is pretty close to being one in the same. I viewed a you tube video of this and an actual tube screamer being played and that was what sold me on this product. Please keep in mind that this is not a distortion pedal it is a tube pedal. It offers a tube crunch sound for the most part unless cranked up then of course it becomes a distortion pedal. I love the tone of it and even though I have an overdrive section on my amp this is much superior to that. Am I worried at all about the plastic housing of it absolutely not and at a price of $19.99 believe me there is nothing to think about.                
Great pedal for the money. This is an awesome little pedal. I am running my PRS Custom 24 through my Marshall MG100FX. Awsome sound. Would give 5 stars if the pedal came with ac adapter. I did not like this pedal not coming with a power chord. You must remember to turn it off if running it on battery power.                
I've had the TO800 for a few months. I'm basically a Jazz Guitar Student who plays mostly clean. However, I was looking for a bit of fatness & sustain without getting into a Metal or 70's Rock sort of tone. The TO800 does the trick by applying a bit of sweet distortion and noticeable sustain. The application of this box makes soloing a bit easier and more controllable than playing totally clean. I'm using an Ibanez ASF75 thin hollowbody on the neck pickup and really like the results. It's Unbelievable for $20 bucks.                
For the price it's definitely worth the purchase. Sounds absolutely amazing. Nice for blues distortion on clean channel and boost on your distortion channel in your amp. The material is made out of plastic. Feels really cheap. Be careful installing the battery. It was a mystery to me. I almost brokeit trying to figure it out. Watch a YouTube video on how to do this. If it broke I would definitely buy another one.                
I have limited use in my country style but when I need it,,,,,,,,it's there in a big way.                 
Standard size, fits my board nicely, nothing bad to add.                
I keep it set to the same settings.                
I have no issues with this nor my other 9 pedals all Behingher.                
Far superior.                
never used it                
I can always use another sound.                
I would replace it.                
This pedal is well worth the effort and money.                
This is a nice pedal.  It's simple to use.  It's got a great sound.  AND it's tougher than you think.                
Works as advertised. You just need to tweak it to your sound of choice. 
As for me, I had to lower the gain setting of my tube amp to make the overdrive work and give your notes some boost and sustain.                 
The drive and the tone to me are the useful settings. I don't like to turn up the level knob high because it makes the amp really noise and it cause too much hiss and hum.                
3 knobs, it's easy as 123 to use this thing.                
It's  a compact size but only thing Behringer could do better is get these pedals changed to metal such as aluminum, which is the case mostly for leading brands of pedals these days.                
ZZounds customer service is outstanding                
I put together a pedal board with 6 Behringer pedals and the PB600 pedal board and didn't even spend $250.00. Yes there plastic and yes there inexpensive and yes there from Behringer but forget about that and try these pedals. As for this tuner well unless your just unlucky or maybe don't know how to tune your guitar even with a tuner this thing is great. Just as good as a boss or any other. I play 100 shows a year and have been using this out on gigs with no problems. It's easy to use and easy to see with a nice bright light and it's at a real attractive price.                
No affect on sound quality.  It seems to also failsafe, when it dies, it still passes signal through.  That's important, so keep reading...                
Seems like a great tuner.  When it works.                
It's a tuner.  Not too complicated.                
Absolutely without a doubt the worst made product in the history of mankind.  Bought one from here at zzounds, brought it to practice, it worked fine.  Brought it to a gig 2 days later on a saturday night, hit it, everything went fine.  Between songs i went to double check tuning, and after i hit the pedal, it acted like i'd just plugged a cable in, then reset.  Every.  single.  time.  RMAed it.  Got a new one.  Brought it to practice.  Worked the first time.  Next time, I hit it, and it starts blinking "0" on the LED, on and off.  The rate sped up over 30 seconds or so, and eventually it just stayed on.  Garbage, complete garbage.                
$30 for a brick.  You're better off at home depot.                
Dunno, zzounds was great for RMAs.                
Sexy products work.  This doesn't.  DNW.                
After years of relying on my onboard tuner on my Alvarez, I purchased a new guitar without a built in tuner. So I decided to grab a pedal tuner for playing gigs. The TU300 seemed to have many of the same features as the BOSS tuner that my friends all use, but at a much lower price. Also, I have had good luck with other Behringer products that I use in my DJ set up so I thought I would give it a shot. This was a MISTAKE. I have not been happy with it from day one. The plastic casing makes me worry that I am going to break it every time I step on it. The battery is a huge pain to change. When it actually works, it takes forever to register the string you are trying to tune. 75% of the time, it won't even register my low e. I would have returned it, but the stream/cent button disappeared after I used it the first show after I got it. I would never buy another one.                
when i rate the sound, i mean how well it actually tunes the guitar, which is pretty good.                
pretty much the same features the Boss tuner has, just a lot cheaper.                
pretty easy to use all of the functions.                
quality is ok, its made outta plastic, so you kinda have to be a little carefull with this pedal.                
for the price i guess its pretty good, however, registering the notes is a bit on the slow side.                
behringer is a pretty good company. They always answered my questions.                
considering i have it, its honestly not the best pedal tuner out there.                
like i said, it tunes your guitar/bass. But it does take a few seconds to register each note, which is a pain to tell you the truth.                
N/A                
INCL. A PURPLE PATCH CORD. HAS 7 TUNING MODES; I ONLY USE 3.                
VERY EASY TO USE; JUST AS EASY AS THE BOSS TU-2.                
METAL BASE,BUT PLASTIC CASE. HOEVER I FOUND THE PRODUCT HEAVY,STURDY BUILT,AND FEEL IT WILL LAST ME A LONG TIME, AS I AM CAREFUL WITH MY GEAR.I AM MY RODIE SO I TRUST IT WILL FAIR WELL GIGING.                
PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH THE ASKING PRICE; BUT HEY IT IS A BEHRINGER!                
HAVE HAD NO NEED FOR CONTACT SO FAR.                
I LIKE THE COLOR,LED S ARE EASY TO SEE EVEN IN LOW LIGHT. FOR THE PRICE IT JUST MAKES GOOD CENTS. AND THE D#+N THING WORKS!                
AGAIN, THE COLOR IS COOL,LED S ARE GREAT, IT WORKS, AND IT COSTS A THIRD OF WHAT A BOSS TU-2 DOES. I THINK I WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE AS A BACK-UP. ENOUGH SAID!!                
This tuner has sound although it should not have sound, it should be true bypass as stated, and the sound it has, no, its not good                
Yes, its got all the features a tuner should have. I would like to mention the bright blue light which is so strong that the actuall display showing the note is hard to see                
Its difficult to change the battery in this tuner, other than that its just a bit more difficult to use than professional tuners because with the Behringer you don't know if its on or off, so you have to rely on the monitor system or backline, Registering the notes on this tuner is really slow                
Its Behringer quality, if you are lucky it still will work tomorrow                
You get what you pay for, but with this tuner you get even less                
Their support is bad - really bad                
I had it, I gave Behringer a chance. But I gave it as a present to a young beginner and bought myself a professional tuner                
Overall - well it's typical Behringer                
Well, its a tuner, does it have a sound, it should not have a sound but should be bypass, Unfortunately it does have a sound, and this is bad.                
Yes, many features, but in a tuner you only need one feature, this is to be able to tune your guitar or bass. Features is one thing, quality is another.                
This tuner is not easy to use. To change the battery is a major operation, the blue LED is too strong, therefore it is difficult to see the display. Also, this tuner is slow, very slow                
Its Behringer quality, if you are lucky it still will work tomorrow, but I wouldn't bet on it.                
The thing is cheap, but you still get less than what you pay for                
Behringer support is terrible, they do not want to know                
I had it but gave it as a present to a kid that is just beginning to learn guitar.                 
If you want a good tuner, do not buy this one. Actually, do not buy anything with the name Behringer on it if you want quality                
Pretty nice sound but it's disposable. Anything made of plastic, even heavy plastic like this pedal, will eventually break. I'm going to take the electronics out and put in a metal housing and add true bypass to get rid of the cheap housing. Overall, I'm not unhappy with this pedal. It does what it's supposed to do and sounds good. You get what you pay for.                
I could probably get better sound for a few hundred bucks! It eliminated all the ambient noise I was dealing with.                
It doesn't have any features; its a box.                
It would have been easier if I didn't have to find out THAT IT DOES NEED A DRIVER!! That information (and software) would have been useful. (Go to the Behringer website, it's all there right next to where it says "No drivers needed.")                
It's solid as a rock, and lighter than one, too!                
This does what I could've spent a ton of money on. I am finishing up my second CD using this thing! Awesome!                
Again, driver info.                 
It's a square box with a tail; how sexy is that?                
I hooked up a small 8 channel sound board to it and record using Adobe Audition. It is an incredidible value. Very, very happy!                
This product gave me a clearer, better quality sound than my laptop's audio did. Allows me to record from external audio sources in high quality stereo, with minimal noise (-32db and better).                
The features are perfect for getting stereo audio into your laptop (or desktop) via the USB port. Also, it allows me to hear playback from my sequencer on the laptop (via USB in, RCA out to amp) while at the same time allowing me to hear the synth I'm playing (via RCA out to amp), so behaves in a similar way to live mixing, although crude. I couldn't detect any latency at all.                
Let the PC boot up completely, then plug in the device and XP will detect it and add it as a human interface device (just like a USB mouse), no need for additional drivers. Just plug the L/R RCA OUT to your amp, mixer, hi fi, or tape machine and the USB to your laptop. You can use an audio switch box with this device to switch between audio inputs if you don't have a mixer.                
Plastic, but solid feel, fine for the price.                
I paid AU$60 new. Good value product for what it does.                
Have not used support yet, but their website gave a reasonable description and contact info.                
I had to have it for my setup. A practical way to get audio via USB into laptops and desktop pc's.                
This product is a permanent, integral part of my home studio setup, and will be used for the long term.                
I must say the sound on this unit is quite pristine.  I only had to adjust the input level of the USB in my sound profiles under control panel to get the playback at the right volume.  Other than that the sound is smooth and crystal clear.                
It is a very basic unit, I wish it had more features but for $30 you can not go wrong.  I run a boss BR-8 and drum machine directly into the RCA ins on this unit and it works wonderfully.                
So simple to use.  Plug and play truly.                
So far it seems fine.  It is made of plastic however and that is fine with me because it will just be used at home for desktop recording.  I would of course have preferred a metal casing but for the price who cares.                
Again, $30 is pocket change for a USB audio interface.  This is a no brainer if you want a simple unit like this.                
Can not rate this, have not contacted them on this unit.  But I also own a Virtualizer and had some questions regarding it and they were friendly and quick with a response.                
It is kind of cool looking for what it is, I guess.                
I love this thing so far, hope it does not fail.  But if it does, I will just replace it, it is cheap enough.                
It obviously does nothing in the way of processing effects etc, nor has any noise canceling, so there is no sound improvement. I have had no troubles with sound quality whatsoever with this, and being an audiophile that says a lot about the product. Overall, very good.                
Does *exactly* what it says on the tin. Its not the very latest in technology, and certainly not fun to use... but then again it is not designed to be. It is practical and does exactly what it needs to do, and it does it well. On the bonus side, it does have optical out which is very nice to see.                
Its as simple as plugging it in and playing. No problems at all, although I did manage to roll back the drivers... which resulted in needing to reinstall the drivers (there *are* drivers available from the Behringer site) which led to being unable to use it temporarily - I just rebooted and everything was fine again.                
Its a small plastic box. It feels quite plastic and lightweight, something a little more weighted is always nice. The silver is not appealing, black would have felt more professional. Despite this, as I have said it is meant to be practical, not sexy. It feels reasonably tough though, I would have no problems using it on-the-go daily!                
Great value, Its most certainly worth $20... although I can't say that I would pay much more.                
The Behringer site gives all the information required, and really there is not enough features to fail! In most cases (in fact practically all cases) the problem is the fault of the user! Read the manual, notices and FAQs!                
Its not sexy, however it is designed to do a job... A job which it does well. Put it this way, I wanted it therefore I brought it. I didn't buy it because it looks cool or it has the latest technology.                
Does exactly what It claims to do, no more than that! On the bonus side, you gain access to a bunch of software from Behringer upon purchase!                
I am a tango DJ. My Mac "lost" a sound channel and the genius bar suggested this unit which for all practical purposes restored both channels. Much cheaper and better than getting a new computer. I've used it for more than a year, and I never dj without it. Original Tango recordings can be hissy, scratchy and thin, but the Behringer provides much better sound (in Buenos Aires,  other dj's commented on how good my sound was) . Highly recommended. At this price, I bought a second one as backup  and have not had to use it yet.   Phone support was immediate and terrific! One of the best things I ever bought!                
Sounds fine, no problems yet.                
My only real complaint is that there is no easy way to monitor the input through the output. It seems the only real way to do this involves using software playthrough, which creates a good deal of lag. The 1/8" monitoring output helps with this, but it would still be a nice thing to have.                
I was able to set it up and have it running in just a few minutes.                
Plastic chasis, but seems sturdy enough.                
Easily the best you will find for the price.                
No problem yet, haven't contacted them.                
Nothing spectacular. Could add a bit of color to your desktop, I guess. But it certainly isn't fugly.                
Suits my needs perfectly.                
crystal clear, just had to lower it a bit                
does what it does and does it well. i'd prefer it was a 4X4 but that's asking too much. i'd like to be able to separate the volumes for in and out(wait, in never changes does it? *slaps self). i will find out later

got me?                
solid product, don't care about it being plastic i'm not a child i know how to treat things. though the top sticker peeled a bit i might have done that thinking i'd paint it i don't know                
30 bucks barely gets me a single shoe. my last one got an ant colony inside it and replacing isn't a problem                
never had to use it, for any of their products. speaks for itself                
looks ugly, but anything not wearing a bikini is ugly to me.                
suits my initial needs to a T, windows linux mac it was useful for anything. as far as i can tell this thing is in it's own category: disposable(practicaly) soundcard                
To configure U-CONTROL UCA202 for laptop with Windows 7 ( which was normally configured for mono mic input ).
(CLICK THE FOLLOWING)
START (bottom left on your screen)
CONTROL PANEL
SOUND
RECORDING
(if your recording has been mono up to this point, the only recording input that you will probably see is a Microphone and if you have your U-CONTROL UCA202 plugged into a USB connector on your laptop, you should then, also see - "2 - USB Audio CODEC" slightly grayed under it).
Double click this icon - (Microphone)
(microphone properties should open)
(and here is where the magic is)
Click ADVANCED
There should be many many choices here to select from.
I have selected "2 Channel 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)" for myself.
afterwards - click "APPLY" then "OK".
And NOW - your laptop mono input should see the stereo inputs from your 
U-CONTROL UCA202.
Since most laptop sound card chips, have been designed to get the best sound level using "automatic gain control" and the input to this chip has been designed to be a microphone level, anything louder will be distorted. So you will probably need to open up a portion of your sound card software and make an adjustment to the INPUT level. Normally, you might find a tiny speaker in the lower right area of your screen. After you right click it, you should see something marked "recording devices". After clicking on recording devices, you should see a tiny microphone that has already been setup as the "Default Device". After double clicking this Microphone, you should see either one, or another series of 
selections. Next click "Levels" and that should provide you with a tiny fader bar that you can slide back and forth. Most Microphone levels can be adjusted from zero to one hundred. Since the input to the audio chip can not be modified, 
you will need to slide it down to about 5. After clicking the fader once with your mouse, you should be able to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to increase or decrease the fader value. After setting it to 5, make certain that you select "Apply" then "OK". Setting your input level to 5, will allow you to get a rather nice stereo recording, instead of a distorted one. 
A good source to connect the inputs of the U-CONTROL UCA202, is an external mixer that music and a microphone can be mixed with. An expensive music source device, like a MP3 player, can be connected to one of the external mixers input. There are many different brands, makes, and models of mixers. Some with a series of built-in effects for the voice, such as echo and reverb. 
Dealing with an external USB audio adapter for your laptop is really a first step into mixing and recording your voice with music. And getting a mixer that suits your production and monetary needs, will go a long way too.
If you have a recorder software program, record a few seconds of a stereo sound, then play it back to confirm that you can now record in stereo on your laptop.
If you do NOT have any type of Recorder Software, goto
 - - - http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ - - 
and Download Audacity. The version at this time is 2.0.3...
Its extremely friendly and quite flexible and you can even put the .EXE file onto a flash drive and load it onto other computers.
A lot of people like to save their recordings in the MP3 file format. First time users of Audacity will find that another .EXE file is needed for this part and can also be found at the same "Audacity" location above. There are already, many websites telling you that Audacity does NOT contain any viruses, malware, or trojans. But I 
always create a "Restore Point" before loading any .EXE files in my PC - just a word to the wise.
Have fun everyone.....                
Sounds as good as the tapes that it is digitizing......Very Good                
Everything you need to digitze audio, except the software. I use Audacity, which is free, to create the digital recording.                
You plug it in and it works. (using Windows2000 Pro)                
A plastic box the size of a deck of cards. Has not given me any trouble.                
For less than $30, this is too good a deal. Nothing even comes close.                
Has not needed any yet. But there is info (manual) on their website.                
Very practical, not sexy.                
Highly recommend.                
I have this connected to my iMac to replace the connection from the headphone jack to my mixer.                
A nice feature is an input which I use for my Dell XPS Desktop.  So now I have both Mac & PC hooked to my mixer                
Just plug it in.  No drivers, no hassle.  You do have to change your Sound Preferences.                
It seems pretty well made                
Well worth the price                
NA                
It's not the type of product you normally want to show off but it does its job well in the background.                
Hopefully, this will last for a few years.                
The sound is a HUGE upgrade to the line input recording I was doing.  I record using Audacity and it worked great.                
I really wish it had a 1/4 inch input rather than the RCA inputs.  Other than that it's pretty easy to use.                
Plug and play                
Pretty reliable.  I am on the road with it twice a week and haven't had a problem yet.                
Great value priced entry with great quality.                
Did not deal with customer support                
Ehh...not really nice looking but who needs that.                
I am using this product to along with Audacity software to transfer my Vinyl to my IPod.  For the low price this unit works great, sounds great.  No noise that my old ears could hear.  Well worth the money.                
For the money you can't really expect to many toys in the form of features.  This unit is bare bones but does what it should and that is to allow you to get audio in and out via USB.                
Plug it in and go.  No drivers needed for XP.                
Not a single problem out of the box.  Made out of plastic but thats ok for the price                
Not had to use any so i can't really say anything                
Not pretty but something that works well does not have to be "Pretty"                
I love this thing. Simple to use, works, quiet, allows stereo inputs for my laptop (which does not have stereo sound card) does what is should                
I have a radio show, for which I record live performances of local bands. I've been looking forever for a device or software to optimize using my laptop for ultimate ease and portability. This device, ROCKS!! Awesome sound, and the true blue cure for 'wahwah' when trying to record on a laptop. I had been told I needed a mixer, and someone else told me I needed an external sound card, etc,etc.  This product, which by the way was an awesome deal at a price match with another website (thank you!!) and I would recommend this to anyone in need as I was. Perfect USB device!                
Came with RCA cables.  All I had to do was buy an inexpensive adapter to be able to plug into a quarter inch jack                
See note above. Virtually effortless. Plug and record!                
(no vendor interaction)                
Sounds Great. I run it through a mixng board , sounds way better that going from mixer direct to PC. I would say all of the hiss and noise is cut out. Only thing I her is any abiant noise of the room, which is due to my levels not the interface.                
Its pretty good. There's not a whole lot to it, 2 RCA I/o left and right. And  a headphone jack with a monitor on off switch which comes in handy. Also a optical port, which I dont use, and thats it. It dosnt have a lot but it more than makes up for it.                 
Like I said theyre is not a lot to it. All I had to do was plug in and go, no drivers no adjustment, I record on A Dell 8200 laptop, and it worked perfect.                
The onlyreason I give an 8 is because its made of plastic, Granted Im not going to be throwing it arounf But I would have liked to see at least aluminum. Other than that all the jacks seem solid. I've only had it 2 days though. Real quality is shown over time.                
If you want to run analog recoding equipment to a PC with the best sound possible this is by far the bet way I have tried, and the sound is great, clear and no delay at all when recording.                
havnt needed it, its easy to use.                
Its an interface, Brains over beauty I suppose.                
There are more expensive ways to get a good sound, But if you know what your doing with your recording sdoftware you can get really close to pro sound on this. For the money it cant be beat, I have used units similar to this that cost $300 or more and I cand tell the difference as far as sound quality goes. The only thing lacking would be Features.                
I changed my lap top from an IBM Think pad to a more modern laptop. The new laptop did not have a line in jack! Arrrgh! I bought several little devices that plug into the USB, and they all had problems. I ended up buying a Zoom H4 recorder and audio interface. $300 at the time. A fine instrument, expensive though. I did not want to leave the H4 at the church, so when I was not there, there was no recording. Then I found the Behringer audio interface. At $36 or so, I can leave it on the sound system so that anyone with a laptop can use the system to make recordings. No buttons to push, no knobs to twist, just plug it in. I think I have already reviewed the UCA202. - I bought the UCA222 and I will be testing it this week or next.                
I use this for spoken word recordings.  I connect a mic by XLR to a small mixer, send it to one channel, and connect that channel's output via an adaptor to the left channel input on the UCA-202.  The sound when recording is far superior to what I get if I connect the mixer to the line in jack on my Dell laptop; on playback, through headphone or even on computer speakers, sound quality is noticeably superior than through the native sound card.  My only complaint is an occasional glitch on playback, just a momentary dropout.  I've never seen it happen on recording, though.                
Obviously, for my purposes, I would prefer this come with XLR inputs and phantom power and 1/4 inch jacks, but what do you expect?  Couple it to a Behringer mixer and you get a USB audio interface that satisfies my needs much more cheaply than any alternative.                 
I plugged it into a USB port on my Vista-running laptop, and it takes over input and output duties. Done.                
Kind of flimsy-feeling, but it has held up well for eight months with no problems.  You can't expect a steel case for $30.                
Well worth it if you need digital input.                
Haven't had to deal with it. The Behringer website provided useful information and software, but it's worked perfectly since I got it.  That's the best kind of support, IMO.                
It's a box with RCA and mini jacks. Oh, and a cord. And a little light. Just a generic USB dongle.  It could be a USB pencil sharpener.                
Until the computer I use for recording comes with a better sound card that this product, I will keep using it.                
I Purchased this unit to transfer my LP's to mp3. It works great. I just hooked up rca cables to it from my stereo out, attached the usb to my laptop. The sound generated is great. I used software by Free sound recorder i obtained from download.com I am very pleased!                
As abvertised the unit works great and ease of operation can't be beat!                
Very easy to configure and use.                
Quality seems good. I was surprised.                
Very nice value. Units i found at best buy were 3 times the price.                
Havent had to use support yet.                
It is small and easy to use.                
only basic features but they are the necessary and they work perfectly                
very easy - plug and play works, but for VST and Reason download the driver from Behringer's web-site.                
seems solid enough though the headphone output could be a bit more solid                
The best thing for the money - similar products cost around 100 pounds - three times as much                
best 30 pounds ever spent - just needed it for low latency midi recording and a digital input form mu preamp - GREAT!                
don't know if i should give it a 10. sounds very good. i listen through Behringer Truth B2031A active studio monitors and the sound is really nice.                
simple and it works. that's good.                
well, ... it's pretty simple.                
for the price, it's a well made. feels good.                
good price.                 
i'm assuming...                
for the kind of very good music sound i want yes.                
very good interface. simple. windows xp recognizes it automatically, and it overrides other audio out, which was my case.                
I just got done with a nightmare trying to get Lexicon's Omega to work here on my PC. That was a complete waste of $300! This unit does indeed sound just as good (for under $30). This is how to get sound in and out of your computer.                
A true ten as there are no features, no drivers, nothing to muck up the works. Simple, useful sound equiptment, what a concept!                
Just plug it into your USB port. So simple it's just a complete no brainer!                
Though I have little to go on here, I have bought many items with the Behringer name and always been very pleased with their capability.                 
for this price I could justify buying one a month (it would still end up cheaper than that crummy Lexicon).                
I have talked to them on a number of occasions reagarding other equiptment and always found them to be freindly and available.                
It's small, cute, out of the way. What more could you ask for.                
This product is serving me far better than a $300 Lexicon Omega (crap)                
Despite the compact size the sound is terrific.                
Only what you need.                
Connect it....use it....nuf said.                
Can't beat it for the price.                
Little "cheezy" with the plastic case, but it works.                
It does what it's designed to do.                
As long as it keeps working, I'll keep using it.                
For anyone using an older Mac mini or Laptop as an "apple TV"...this product is awesome... digital optical out for full surround sound capability..streaming music and vids to the home theater ...great sound..no latency. Stop using the headphone jack and get the most out of your machine! USB audio codec..not software to install. plug and play!                
NA.                  
Like others, I would have liked to have seen it made from something other than plastic, but I don't entend on treating it very rough anyway.  For the money you just aren't going to find anything better.                
Just plug it up and go.  Nothing to it.                
Again, made of plastic, and the USB cable is hardwired.                
t any better price.                
Haven't needed it for this piece of geer, but I have delt withBehringer before, and they have a has great support team.                
I love this little box.  The sound chip was going out on my Dell laptop, and I use it to play break music with, so had to either find a solution or have the laptop repaired.  I'm glad I chose to buy the UCA202!  Far superior sound quality than the chip inside my laptop, and cheaper than having the laptop sent off for repairs.  I would definately buy another, and intend to do so.                
had problems recording to computer from Fostex Multitracker once I added the Berhinger interface the strange phase style sounds disappeared and I was back in bussiness                
The Interface took care of all the problems. Before, when I recorded onto my laptop, It was overdriving,(sounded kinda like your singing in water). I have clean sound now. I use it on my Behringer mixer, I have also used it on a Peavey mixer also.                 
Just plug it in.                
It's O.K., I wouldn't want to drop it, (It's plastic).                
Way less than other interfaces I found.                
It's hard to talk to someone.                
It's a tool, no more, no less.                
This will be it. It does the job. I'm happy.                
sound is just fine                
has no features, but it is not supposed to
many have said here "has no drivers". well, it actually uses the microsoft usb drivers that come with windows. this is NOT the way to go for people looking to do software instruments, for that you need asio drivers.
comes with no software                
plug it in, duh
seems ok                
nice and cheap                
this is great for laptops with crappy sound i/o builtin and you want something cheap
great to replace laptop i/o
no midi
but you are stuck with windows drivers - too much latency for software instruments with midi                
For some reason, it sounds find on the USB1.1 ports on my desktop, but when used on either USB2.0 port on my laptop, it sends an annoying hum that is above 60Hz and therefore can't be eliminated with your usual rumble filter. It didn't cost much but I wasn't expecting such a problem, especially considering the D-A SNR was listed as being >89dB! I was planning on using this for mobile recording, but now it's relegated to emergency duty.                
A chimpanzee and an intern could figure this thing out. :-)                
It's a Behringer so it's well-built. It does what it does consistently, just not up to a high standard.                
It is cheaper than most items that promise to do the same thing, and therefore is a reasonable bargain. Aside from the hum, or perhaps I should say in addition to it, it delivers great sound.                
I am already searching for another product to do what this one does -- but without hum in a USB2.0 port.                
Accept only line level signals, so it's better to have some kind of mixerwith preamp to accompany - so you could record guitar or mic. Doesn't include limiter or something similar - so be carefull with levels - too much and you'll have nasty clipping (even I don't like it). Better the fidelity of incoming signal - the better result, I think every AD converter would add some static(it has no movement opposed to analog) to the sound (mostly because its hum/hissless)                
I give 5 because I hate RCA plugs, and probably hate them to the rest of my life - I tried to make 1/4 plugs , so i'd had to put it in the bigger enclosure, but during process i burned out little UCA. I really feel myself bad about that. But nonetheless i'll buy second one.                
OK. If you just plug it you will get windows driver (wich is bad). SO you'll have to go the BEHR site and take their ASIO driver. When it came out i was almost crying. I could actually play with REAL 2 ms delay! ASIO4ALL - was liyng to me saying 64ms (actually its about 14ms with ASIO4ALL). Well , for waiting of new ASIO drivers i give 5.                
Its surisingly good built. The output level is good (thanks to the JRC386 amplifiers).                
I bought it for 20$ (the UCA200 version). I really hope these guys have some left for 20$. If not - 50$ isn't that much to pay.                 
Haven't dealt with them. Though here its not the case when warranty will help.                
Neutral. If you want to make sound than it is very appealing.                
Only 2 channels in, 2 channels out. RCA plugs. Good ASIO.                 
sounds great, but i'm not audiophile.                
can't really say much bad stuff about this, though it would be nice to be able to route to the individual L/R outputs and headphones, rather than just a single stereo output and headphone monitor. that is, it'd be nice to see separate outputs for each one rather than having to pan the channels to achieve the same thing.
when i'm not using it for live sound, i use it as my laptop's sound card so i can use optical out. works flawlessly in linux, which is totally awesome.                
plugged in, worked first time in both windows and linux (actually better in linux)                
nothing wrong here -- i use it during band practice and live shows. holds up fine.                
surprisingly awesome for $35.                
smaller than i thought.                
Absolutely atrocious sound.  While the signal maintains harmonic integriy, my immediate gripe is a signal flow issue.  The RCA leads aren't properly grounded, resulting in signal interference and noise modulation... attempted with multiple RCA cables to no avail.  I would rather haul my turntables and mixer inconveniently across the country to a ProTools box instead of using this.                
Theoretically, it has the features one needs.                
I managed to plug in all the cables.  As for getting results?  None.                
It would have a qualty score if it actually sent audio into the computer for recording.                
Biggest mistake of a purchase in my life.                
Contacted Behringer...support was helpful, it failed the resolve the "no-input onto the computer system" issue.                
Giving it a 5 because cosmetically and ideally, it has the appeal.  In implemenation however, it fails completely.                
This thing is noisy. Just moving it around makes noise like a live mike.                
The headphone line out is not loud enough to do anything with.                
Plug it in and it works                
Made extremely cheaply, like all Behringer products, but some of Behringer products actually do a decent job                
Waste of $30.00                
I'm not going to bother to call.                
A small unit like this would be great if it was not so noisy.                
This thing is useless for anyone who cares about pro audio.                
I used this product to convert audio from a DVD player to MP3 on my computer. Unfortunately, when I played it back from the conputer, the audio was distorted and unusable for my video project. I haven't given up on this project, but will need more time to add input pads or whatever is needed to get clean audio.                
I have a lenovo thinkpad E520 laptop. I bought this product because my laptop does not have a line in input. It suppose to be a headphones/mic dual port, but since it didn't work, i Purchased this product. Luckily it works if I am mixing vinyl records. But for some reason, the SL1 usb won't work concurrently with this USB card...which was my sole purpose of purchasing this item. Still trying to figure out a fix for this.                
My main reason for this purchase was to help someone upgrade their laptop PC from a "mic only" input to a "line level" input. It wasn't until after everything was delivered and plugged in that we realized that this USB plug-In was mainly an extension for whatever you already had as a soundcard and not a replacement. Most tower type PC's with a soundcard have stereo miniature phone plugs for the line inputs and output. It seems that this device was built mainly to replace those connectors with the standard stereo phono line inputs and outputs. The entire device works perfectly and the on-board headphone connector is great, but if you're looking to replace your current soundcard "this won't do it", it just extends all the current properties of whatever soundcard you have, into it's own little box. Which means if you want to record a line level into a PC that only has a mic level input, after reducing your input level to about 1, your recording quality won't sound like you're expecting.                
I WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO CONNECT MY COMPUTER TO A PA SYSTEM, THE BEHRINGER UCA 202 USB INTERFACE SOLVED THE PROBLEM WITHOUT KILLING MY WALLET. THE SOUND IS MUCH CLEANER THAN IT WAS WHEN I USED THE HEADPHONE JACK ON THE COMPUTER. NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS PLUG INTO THE USB PORT AND I HAVE LINE IN AND LINE OUT RCA JACKS.                 
THERE WAS A FREE SOFTWARE PROGRAM WHICH IS ALSO FREE ON THE INTERNET                 
SET UP WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD. INSTRUCTION MANUAL WAS OF LITTLE HELP.                
VERY WELL MADE                
YES IT IS WORTH THE MONEY                
I AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD REPLACE IT IF NEEDED.                
Sounds absolutely clean to me. No buzz.                
No one. That's I wanted.                
Just plug and play. Cannot be more simple. The sound is automatically switch from the sound card to the interface.                
Unbeatable for the price                
I really did not even need the manual, I just connected the uca202 to my usb hub, connected my stereo aux inputs to the 202 outputs, opened up WinAmp double clicked on a song and it worked, I'm baffeled at how it routed through my hub no set up nothing, how does it do that?
I use a laptop and when I get home I just wanted to plug one usb cord into my laptop and have all my "sutff" (keyboard, printer, scanner, external hard drive with all my music I listen to, and now my stero amp via behringer's UCA202.  Reallllly cool.                
Time will tell                
Sounds great for what I need it for.                
Features are exactly what I needed  - nothing more, nothing less.                 
Just plug it in and it works - can't get any easier.                 
Solid.                 
The least expensive USB audio interface that I could find.                 
Being that I didn't needed any support, I can't comment on this.                  
"I needed it".  The 3.5mm jack wore out on my Mac G4.  This product served a perfect solution to the problem.                 
Just wanted to update you guys that are thinking of buying this, it works great so far and It work with Vista 64 bit OS! i just plugged it in and thought oh no, theres an annoying static in the music playback. I may a few adjustments to the latency, restarted my syste and the static is completly gone an dthis sounds just as good as my HIGH DOLLAR Maya Audio card that was a few hundred bucks but is not compatable with vista 64! If your thinkabout buying this an dyou have Vista or Vista 64 BUY IT! It works great!                
There really are no features for this thing, just plug it in and start recording.                
This was very easy to use.                
Behringer was helpful with support and friendly but had not tested this device with Vista or Vista 64.                 
Did what was advertised. It made my dell laptop music sound perfect. Replaced the minimal sound card inside with a great sounding digital to analog converter. Just plug into usb and enjoy the music through your home sound system. Wonderful product,a great buy for triple the price.                
The sound quality is nice as well.  It can be used as its own sound card when plugged into the usb on your computer.                  
It has two rca out/in jacks for recording or playing and a headphone jack.  It also has an optical out cable as well.  It has a lot of software that comes with it, however I had to download it all from the Behringer site.                
It is very strait forward to use.  Simply plug it in and once your computer installs it. you will be ready to go.  Be sure you go into the sound settings to make sure it is checked so you can hear sound from it.                
It seems built well.                
I don't know of any other products that I can compare it to.  You get a lot of bang for the buck with this product.                
The website is fairly easy to navigate to download the software.                
It is small so it does not take up much room.                
This thing is small but packs plenty.  I bought it to go along with my xenyx 1202fx and it works great with it.                  
I purchased this soon after getting the xenyx 1202fx. I wanted something inexpensive to record with. What i found was the uca222. It is very inexpensive and makes it very easy to record to my computer. I know most of the time you get what you pay for but this little piece of hardware is worth every penny and then some. I use windows 7 and this thing works great with it. It is pretty strait forward. It is also easy to hook up other speakers with rca cables. Very easy to use at a very affordable price.                 
Does everything promised with the ease of USB. It does want to tweak an audio hardware setting (something to look out for) easily reset to CU default and device will still function perfectly.                
Pure ear candy. I set it up with Guitar Rig 4, very cool. I downloaded like a million presets. The sound you get depends more on the software you use. With guitar rig, the sound is excellent, almost professional. If you can get your hands on good software, you got it made.                 
It now works in XP, Vista, Windows 7. It's only the interface. The drivers are great, but the software is not.                
The driver setup walks you through.                
It's plastic. Just baby it a little.                
Cheaper than any other usb interface for guitar.                
Never tried, but I heard things.                
It's a dorky peace of plastic.                
It sure beats plugging into a computer sound card. For guitar, USB connections rule. It works fine, it's just an interface, cheap, and I'd buy it again.                
The combo amps  give you multiple hoices for sound, you get one of the 3 for free, buy the others for $15 each but beware that this is ONLY a one person practice tool                
The accessories, like the included Audacity recording program DO NOT work with this unit, you must use the Behringer ASIO and audcity wil not, is not allowed to accept it                
It either works out of the box or you spend a lot of time trying to figure it out, the so called manual leaves a lot to be desired                
It's ok for the price, plastic like everything else these days and I have a hard time keeping the jack cord plugged in.                
This is probably a good value if ALL you want is the ability to play using your computer instead of an amp  beyond that forget it.                
In a  week of asking for help I got one auto response which was download and read the iaxe owners manual. wrote back three times and am still waiting almost a week later                
Like 
I said if all you want is to practice using your computer as an amp it's fine, that is all it does, if you want to record look elsewhere and expect to spend a grand or more before your done, as well as investing weeks or months or longer just learning how to use everything.                
As a practice tool it's probably great, but as a means for recording your tunes forget it, it doesn't really do that, certainly not the way you would hope for.                
The unit works well on the input side, but I agree with another reviewer, the input level seems a little low.  On the output side, it works OK with headphones, but emits a high pitched tone in the background when plugged into speakers for monitoring without headphones.  Thankfully, the recorded sound is fine.                
Pretty bare bones.  Comes with 3 "Guitar Combos" based on Native Instruments Guitar Rig, but you can only select one to keep.  Also, contrary to the documentation you cannot use the Guitar Combo as a VST plug-in to another audio application like the free Audicity tool that is supplied.   The software also does not let you route the output to your soundcard/computer speakers.  You have to physically connect the headphone output which leads to the high pitched tone problem I metioned in the sound rating I gave it.                
This is fairly easy to use, however the Windows drivers are difficut to uninstall (it makes you physically disconnect ALL of your USB devices then reboot your computer).                
The unit itself seems to be made well.                
Its the least expensive one out there.  You get what you pay for.                
The jury's still out.  I have a request in about the high-pitched tone I get while running it into computer speakers.  We'll see if they respond.                
Eh.                
I'm already searching for another product, though I haven't yet given up on this.                
I foolishly bought two of these things, and both products arrived in factory-sealed boxes WITHOUT any CD enclosed (i.e, no drivers, no audio software, no amp modeling, no nothing)!. Unbelievable! It states right in the USer Manual that the product comes with software on enclosed CD and it shows a software CD right on the external packaging. Are these people kidding? I wouldn't buy another Behringer product if they PAID me to use it! They're nothing but absolute amateurs!                
The interface didn't work at all for me, the native instruments would have been great if it was possible to activate the program. N. I. website activation nightmare!!! Beware! I found the UCG102 a pointless endeavor as the quality did not exist and the unit had no long lasting type of design to it more like the box your burger came in.                
The software is impossible to load on to a computer so I can't really tell you whether or not the product works.  I emailed Behringer for some support but have yet to hear from them.  If I figure it out, maybe I'll change the review.                
The sound of this product is terrible, there is alot of altering required to avoid getting a high pitched noise over everything else.
And even then the amp models arent great.                
The product doesnt do what it says it does, you cannot use the amp models to record through audacity. I have spent weeks trying to fix all the problems.                
Dont bother                
You get what you pay for                
The product is pointless                
I havent tried to contact them                
I was not satisfied with the product and would not recommend it to anyone.                
The sound is quite good for the price...I usually use it with a wah pedal, but tried it without other preamps and sounded just fine...I use it for recording with guitar rig 4 and it works just fine...                
guitar combos are sort of a demo for guitar rig, so you might want to get the hole soft...I did not use the rest of the package, but it includes also audicity.
Has a jack slot for headphones/speakers, and frankly I've never had to push the headphones volum more than 1/3-2/3, so the preamplification is quite good.
A level switch for boosting the signal can be very useful.
I plug in the headphones slot my speakers, and I still can hear my laptop's speakers so, they CAN work at the same time.                
I don;t know about other users but, in my case, I simply plugged it in and it was ready to go...the product's driver is on the cd, but you might want to upgrade it or so from the behringer site or if you want to use other software than the combos you may want to install the asio4all driver, which you can simply google...                
Plastic, don't be rough.
At this price you would not expect otherwise                
It is the best item at this price, you will not get better quality sound from any other interfaces at this price, and the only one that's better and near this price would be a line6 pod ux2, in which you have to invest a lot.                
Never had to use it, but they gave me a 24 month warranty                
sounds comes in, only with line levels though. if you try to run a mic through it you'll have to boost the heck out of the signal                
came with crappy software. crappy drivers.  nearly crashed my computer.  downloaded necassary stuff online, got it working, but corrupted other stuff on my computer that normally works fine. crap.                
i went to school for this stuff and it took me three days to get a signal.                
cheap plastic. gets lost easily, probably broken easy too. mines not broken yet, but then again, the hammer's still in the drawer                
don't buy it.  I've never returned anything to a music store, but i think i just might return this one. like i said, corrupted my computer, and eventually the unit stopped working all together.  i've burned a lot of money on crappy items in my day, but this one takes the cake in my opinion.                 
didn't even bother.  I deemed it crap and all the live support in the world wouldn't change that                
it could easier be mistaken for an hairless albino mouse.. save the time and get a real mouse that eats and stuff                
overall like i said, i went to school for this stuff. i can build and run a studio from the ground up, and if you're panning on buying this unit, you might as well take two twenties and set them on fire. peace                
I bought this unit to record my tapes and vinyl records to mp3. I connected my turntable and my tape player thru a stereo AB switch, plugged my headphones into the interface, used Audacity to record, and with the proper settings in Win 7 and Audacity I was in business. I couldn't be happier with the results. The recording is clear as a bell. Behringer did good!                
I use this with Music Studio app on iPad... (must have camera connection kit, too) It works well but even when used on a PC w/Audacity I find amplification of the signal BEFORE you process will give higher output levels - (no loss of volume on playback as compared to standard mp3) - 
Does exactly what I hoped it would do - convert old DAT tapes to digital files.  Could not be easier to use.  Great price!                
Ordered Fri. PM from zZounds; arrived Tues. AM over holiday weekend for $2.99 shipping.  Can't beat that!  This is a great hardware product.  But unless you are extremely knowledgeable, you may have software problems.  zZounds should include a note with this product, that if you plan to use Audacity, download the latest version, do not use the version on the supplied disc.  The note also should say, "For Windows Audacity users: IMPORTANT!  See the FAQ 'How can I record in stereo?' on the Audacity web site."  I wasted a lot of time getting Audacity to do 2-channel stereo because I was getting only mono and could not tell whether I had a hardware or software problem.                
the UFO202 works as described except for some time/latency "hiccups" that happen the longer I i use it in session. besides that ... it does what it's supposed to do.                
I am very happy with this purchase.                
this mic is built cheap and eat batteris like crazy spend your money one time not twice like me                
For the price, the UM2 is amazing. The knobs on the top are only for volumes, which is not shown, sadly). Either way, totally worth it, sounds great, and works as advertised                
For a small little 2i2 interface its well worth it. i bought one for traveling and collaborating with others and it spot on. a wittle bright and higher frequesncies and on mac i had to create a special auto routing for it on my mac but its spot on behringer made me mad becaue it was not easy to get the Traction & DAW -took months, they never sent a code and i hade to go to customer service which took some time... .                
Ive been playing guitar for thirty years and this pedal screams 80's Metal, Ratt, Vinnie Vincent Invasion, Dokken and countless others. Over the years ive owned about every distortion pedal on the market and this  $25 dollar pedal is as good as any, sound wise. Plastic it is but Metal it screams don't be afraid take a ride into the unknown and release the inner Metal God inside you. It will be the ride of your life!                
I use this in conjunction with a tube overdrive and an old Marshall Govnor. I achieve three levels of drive this way. First is the Tube Overdrive for some overdriven tube amp sounds. Next is the Govnor for classic Marshall sounds and then comes this pedal. I have it set up to sound like a Triple Rectifier on steroids for when I want to get my amp into massive preamp tube breakup and I use it to get classic Van Halen, Santana,  and other heavy sounds. I works great and I never had to do much tweaking to get the sound I want but this pedal is very versatile and playing around with all the knobs can take you from heavy distortion to metal sustained heaven. I highly recommend it.                 
The sounds are incredible, it leaves off where the super metal and the heavy metal are. It has both the mid and high controls with an added mid frequency control that allows you to cut through the mix or make it heavier. The distortion is heavy, in fact so heavy i only put at about   2 o'clock.                
With all the eq it has, its got the best features in Behringer's distortion range  and at this price its hard to beat.                
Its easy to use but it takes a little bit of tweaking to find your favorite sound(What pedal doens't take tweaking anyways?)                
It is sturdy as long as you don't stomp on it super hard but why would you do that anyways. It has lasted me a couple gigs now and its still good.                
Best for this price and more.                
Only had to talk with them once (for a Behringer multi fx-600) and they quickly switched it out for a new working pedal.                
It adds color to my board so its pretty nice.                
I expect to be satisfied with it until behringer comes out with another better distortion pedal.                
This pedal has so much bite and balls.... it sounds just like its 90 dollar competitors... and its 25 BUCKS! True, it's plastic... but for me that's fine since I'm just a bedroom strummer with a practice amp which doesn't give me a metal overdrive... but this pedal is all you need if metal is your goal.                 
i really like it, its the same as the Boss metal zone for way less and it has less his then the boss metal zone!                
it had nothing that came with it, just the pedal!                
really easy if you know the osund you want.                
i have had the ultra metal for about a month and still works, i do worry about the fact that its like 98% plastic!                
for $25 its amazing and the his is lesser then the metal zone                
i have had no issues                
could use like a better name like demon distortion!                
i will keep this as long as it last!                
i woulnt know because i coulnt get it to work! i even called my guitar lesson-place because this was my first one, and i did everything right, and it still didnt work!                
it included nothing except a tiny little panflet of directions (rubbish) and nothing else, not even a battery!                
the directions were a bit of rubbish, it took me about a day to find the battery slot, and it doesnt tell you were it is! this was my first distortion pedal and it SUCKED                 
no, its plastic, i mean, not really quality material                
piece of crap for 30 bucks                
i havent used it                
piece o' crap                
Being very new to recording, I was hesitant to spend a lot of money on an interface only to find out that recording was too complex or too time consuming for me. I am 59 and a lifelong guitar player that wanted to capture some of my playing digitally before I get too much older and don't have the dexterity that I now have.
I use GarageBand  and must say that this has truly been a plug-n-play device for me. GB immediately found the UMC202HD device upon starting the app and assigned it automatically as my input/output device. So all I had to do then was set the I/O levels and I was off and running laying down a new track for a song.
I was amazed at how much better my virtual guitar amps sounded with this device. I haven't tried a microphone yet, but I expect that it will be just as pleasant an experience. The pad switch on the inputs is a very nice touch which I immediately found handy. This device seems to be very quiet as well. I would encourage anyone who is on a budget or like me and didn't want to spend a lot of money on an interface only to find out that recording is too time consuming or they don't enjoy it, to buy this interface. If you are planning to spend $100 -$125 on a new 2 channel interface, I strongly recommend that you buy this one  instead as you will not be disappointed. With zZounds excellent returns policy, you have nothing to lose by trying it. I can't speak for the longevity of this device yet,  but at $59, even if it bites the dust in 2 years, I would gladly purchase the same model again or possibly upgrade to a Behringer with more I/O channels if needed. I was using a 2 year old USB Cable/Interface that I paid $40 for because I did not want to spend $150 at the time to find out that recording was not for me. Needless to say, that cable interface  worked just well enough that I figured out how to use GB, but latency was an issue that would occur frequently and I would have to restart GB.  Now I am wowed by the difference in sound quality and have not observed any latency when recording guitar and bass.
I too have not received my Tracktion software key via email even though I registered successfully. I downloaded all of the free Mac plug-ins on the Behringer site but I have been unable to find them in Garageband even after several reboots of the app. I have not contacted support yet, but may do so in a few days. Right now, I am just having fun with what I have.                
Surprisingly good! It seems that Behringer learned something from buying Midas. I get a clean, consistent 48v signal and very little if any noise. The pots are quiet and overall does a great job!                
It comes with the standard feature set that you find with most two channel interfaces, but it does them well.                
*Almost* plug and play. I say almost because no matter what I do, my production office copy of ProTools 11 Still won't play ball with it. But Sonar X3, Reaper, Ableton Live and Studio One all have no problems whatsoever. And, it makes for a great podcasting/Google Hangout interface too! This really is a great little box for someone who wants to start recording on their own to get into things. This with a $60 license of Reaper can get ANYONE recording! I would of killed for a cheap and easy option like this 10 years ago                
I have only had it for a little over 8 months, but surprisingly good! Dunno if I want to count my chickens before they hatch (because it is still Behringer), but I have been pleasantly surprised                
While there are some others that play in this category, I refuse to acknowledge PreSonus. That makes Behringer one of the best buys I've found under $100                
Haven't had to use it yet... in the past they were as bad as PreSonus, but these days, they may be improving. But, no need to use them yet                
While it looks cooler than the other boxes, it is still just a box. The Wow factor comes from the fact that it's actually made by Behringer... and it's actually GOOD! If they keep doing stuff like this, I may buy much more from them                
I got this as a "fluff" item to fill out one of zZounds financing requirements to get an order to a certain total. I didn't expect much given my previous experience with Behringer. But, I do have to say I am pleasantly surprised! Feels surprisingly good in quality (better than PreSonus... which isn't hard... and even better than Focusrite). But, no one cares how an interface feels or looks, just sounds. And... this one does the job well! Totally USB powered and easy to use, with no extras you don't need. Even the knobs and switches feel pretty solid. The *only* thing I would change is to put the phantom power switch on the front, but that is a small complaint.                
I just got this like three days ago I looked at it was like no way this little thing going out preform my m- audio interface then I compared it to the Steinberg ur22. This little monster can do it all. Plus with a db pad cut button and direct monitoring button. Not to even mention the clear crisp direct sound this little monster puts out. And I tested in fl studio,Reason,sonar,cubase, and the mpc software. It's legit I would recommend this little monster to any one. And I'm willing to stand by it. I been producing and engineering 13yrs. Using outboard and other things. O yea and sampling threw it with my phone.                
I'm not new to USB interfaces, but a bit baffled why it's taking so long to get my download code for Traction software. It requires an upload of receipt (which is weird because I ASSUME it means the one from zZounds???) but upon submitting the registration, it says you will receive email, NO EMAIL and tech support is EMAIL ONLY - which translated means I'm likely to receive a bunch of emails with links to the directions that aren't specfic and all say 'you will receive email.' So - at first unboxing I'm not happy with the support of this product. Box itself 'seems' durable, but boy would be nice to use it! I'll update IF I get it working.                
From recording vocal, and guitar stems. Tracking drums. Live monitoring with no latency (assuming you adjust your driver settings) and plugins. It has made countless songs for me already, and I have had no issues. Built like a tank. Would highly recommend UMC style interfaces to any musician seeking the realm of DAW, and plugins.                
For me I have had Zero issues with this audio interface, sounds great too.  almost plug n play, drivers are obviously needed.                
A great 4 channel USB interface for the price. The pre-amps are exceptionally quiet. The perfect unit for my home studio. I had to download the latest driver from Behringer in order to get my DAW to recognize the UMC404HD, but no problems after that.                
Worked flawlessly out of the box after driver installation, but it went downhill from there. Driver has flaked on me since. After installing newest driver I can use it in Reaper again, but output only from left channel. Have reached out to customer support, but haven't heard back as of yet. I feel like I've spent more time trouble shooting this interface than recording with it so far. Records decently when it has worked. If I can ever get it working properly again and without issue it will have been money well spent despite the issues. If I can't get it working properly soon I will try a Focusrite interface.                
This is completely not compatible with Windows 7. Behringer has LIED in their videos, and they made made several versions to please the FCC. Other versions of Windows have a little more luck. But this is made for MAC. They are dfumping it at 99 bucks. And have had several lawsuits settled out of court already. Stay away from this if you have any WINDOWS OS                
I am basing my 10 rating strictly on the keyboard itself and not the software that's included.
The overall design of this controller is brilliant..very solid,compact and simple,but with very smooth controls and fantastic full size keys with semi-weighted action....I am really surprised and amazed by this keyboard!!                
The EnergyXT DAW that came with this keyboard is virtually useless without the upgrade.
The upgrade was a nightmare,as the upgrade is NOT available for download directly from their website!
You pay for the license first,and then you wait for someone from the company to send it to you via e-mail(whenever they feel like getting around to it).
I waited a week for them to send me the upgrade and when I received it,I spent another week trying to install it and it never worked(I have Windows 7).
I finally got my refund,but I'll never deal with EnergyXT again.The DAW's simplicity is nice,but since it is such an unstable program,it's a sick joke....my advice; stay far away from EnergyXT & save your money for a program that is known to work.                
The build quality is the best I've ever seen for the money.                
The keyboard itself is the best value out there.                
Behringer is EnergyXT's distributor,so you'll have to deal with EnergyXT directly....they are helpful,but very slow.                
Its just a midi controller                
no pads, but it has plenty of knobs!                
Its pretty much plug and play, at least on macs.                 
The only real con here is the pitch bend is kindof loud, and the keys make some noise, but the feel is fine and has plenty of resistance.                 
Worth it. 19                
Its bright metallic  red !  Would easily match a nord lead.                
this is a midi controller, so it doesn't have sounds.                
it hasn't worked for me, despite hours of trying with online searches, manuals, forums etc..                
does not sync smoothly to mac.. doesn't connect to midi sound module at all.. very difficult to get any information from their website.  It is mind blowing that the company offers no instructions in their manuals at all..especially for a keyboard with the unusual aspect of not having a  display window...you would think that they would explain various operations in detail since it limited in visual feedback                
ok, i give this a 3 because when i unpacked it, it felt pretty solid..heavier than i imagined..the knobs etc seem pretty tough..BUT..
one of the keys ( A note in middle of keyboard)only works if you push realllllly hard..making the device virtually useless..I will be returning it asap                
the price is cheaper than everyone else, and the product is unusable..what a bargain.                
ok, behringer takes the cake for giving you the run around..no phone numbers..only endless, poorly designed 'support' areas..this aspect may have been the most frustrating of all..even more than the keyboard arriving broken..easily the worst experience I've ever had with a musical instrument company.                
it's red.                
i will return it immediately, and unless I can get any answers from support, I will just get my money back and buy an m-audio controller                
No sound as its a midi keyboard                
Well built for the price                
Works perfect with iPad 2 garageband an with provided software without any problems                
Looks great well built for the price                
Great price for what you get                
None needed                
Works perfect with iPad 2 without any extra power                
A long time                
This thing is awful!! Not only does it simply not work on all 6 strings, but the tone it generates oscillates back and forth if you let the note sound long enough but eventually it will do it anyway. On the highest string you have to nearly break it to get it to make a sound and even then its a weird modulated sound that only lasts for about a second.                
You pretty much have 3 volume knobs and a hi-med-low switch that, to me, does nothing and no way to raise the pitch and octave.                
Not too hard. Getting the battery in is lame. You have to take the pedal cover off. Maybe that's how it is with all of them. I don't know. It's still lame. An old fashion battery door should do.                
Looks like a great pedal. Pretty solid. Doesn't look particularly cheap.                
Seriously I just got this pedal in the mail today after waiting what felt like forever to get it and it turned out to be just awful! I was so excited to get one after having used an octave pedal with my guitar instructor (his was a different brand). I'm returning this one and getting his brand.                
I purchased this pedal as an inexpensive solution to the tremolo found on some of the Fender amps. I was looking at the Tremolo / Pan / Stereo pedal but ordered this one instead. I was hesitant after reading some reviews online that complained of volume drop.I have not experienced any of the volume drop and overall I am satisfied with this tremolo. I could have spent lots more money to get the same effect but this is an effect that is used sparingly. I find it comparable to the other effects I looked at for a lot less cash.                
Not perfect but for the excellent. It does have a slight volume drop if you use to much depth but it is more of a dark sound. I set the depth about two o'clock and it is perfect. All of the classic fender and vox sounds plus everything in between. Great surf, blues, and R&B or what ever. Very quiet and transparent if you don't max out the depth control.                
After buying two other Behringer Pedals which work just fine, I decided to try a Vibrato Pedal primarily because it was rather fun purchasing a stomp box for only $25 bucks.
The UV300 Vibrato Pedal has become one of my primary pedals.  I play at lot of "clean chordal comping jazz stuff" and the pedal gives the chords a rather "vibraphone quality" which is quite beautiful when combined with a little reverb.
.
One of the things to understand is;  The UV300 is NOT a Tremolo Pedal.  It provides Frequency Modulation to the guitar much as a whammy bar does.  That's what it's supposed to do and the pedal does it quite nicely.  Vibrato is Modulated Frequency.  Tremolo is Modulated Amplitude.  Don't confuse the two.  If you're looking for that "Bo Diddley Tremolo Sound" get a Tremolo Pedal.
The pedal is also capable of provided more "radical modulations" to the guitar but as I'm just a humble Jazz Guitar Student playing clean most of the time I'm no subject matter expert on what to do with the more extreme settings. 
Overall, the UV300 is a keeper and a fun device.
This works really well for the price. It's understandable that it came in plastic instead of an aluminum case. I would recommend for at home or for jam sessions, but not to sure for a live set...                
Terrible.  The thing sounds more like a BAD chorus pedal.  I bought it for the "classic" vibrato effect.  It is nothing like the classic 60's, 70's vibrato effects.  The "RISE" control doesn't seem to do much.  And of course for ture "classic" vibrato, you wouldn't want any modulation.  So that is a real problem.                
Behringer is trying to give us the extra option to introduce more or less modulation to give more of a chorus sound, but the "RISE" control didn't seem to do much.  And it really sounded terrible no matter how I set the controls.  I wouldn't clasify the sound as vibrato nor chorus.  Just a trashy cheap sound.                
They tried.                
It was defective.  There was an audible electronic clicking no matter if the pedal was active or inactive.                
No matter what the price, it has to work!                
Don't know                
I wouldn't even use this if I were at the gig and had nothing else to use.  I would just set it aside and play the guitar flat!  That's how bad it is.                
I more than satisfied with the sound.  Distortion, sustain, echo, reverb are very good to excellent.                
Takes a while to get used to.  Download the free editing Window software from Behringer web site, and get a low cost USB to MIDI converter cable to get to really tweaking your sound.                
The power connection is something I fear is going to fail.  You have to plug and unplug it, there is no on/off switch.                
You can't beat this for the price.  About $108 street price.  Get one.                
The web site has manuals, and free editing software.                
I like the various tones that I can achieve without spending a fortune on 'stomp' boxes.  Even the 'touch' wah is very effectivie.                
I would replace it if it was lost, stolen, or broken.                
This thing is the best, it records with the software and sounds killer, perfect size. Its way better than the old models  and for the money. The Germans score again.                
I have had mine for around two years now, and I've used it for many live shows. I like to run mine through tube, or hybrid tube amps using only slight distortion and effects. This pushes the pre amp tubes really nicely in my amps and I can get all kinds great tones. It sounds really good through the clean channel of a solid state amp to. You can use the two out puts to run to two different amps as well, which gives you really interesting tones. This is good to, if all you have is two smaller amps and need to be louder,  just use them at the same time. It has been dropped, thrown in gig bags, and accidentally spray painted and is still going strong.                
I love this piece of equipment. Its easy to dial in a good tone, and sounds huge through headphones. My Ibanez, a friends Strat and an ESP Les Paul copy all sounded great, with a nice tube-like sag and sparkle and loads of sustain on tap.Simple to jam along to songs using the aux jack. Great investment in your playing                
I have been using this unit for the past month. It has been a good replacement to my previous guitar controler. The amp emulations and drive options give me more control and flexibility with the sounds I get from my guitar. I was impressed because I played with another guitar player who used a Twin Reverb. I liked the sound so I played with the emulation and was pleased with the sound and also that the gain gave me very subtle variations in the amount of distortion based on the level of the guitar. There is less flexibility with effects because you are limited to one selection per memory location. The effects are either one or a combination of two effects with three variations the can be adjusted to the saved memory location. 
     I think this is a very good value for the cost but I am continuing to look at other options. It does not use a standard 9 volt power supply but it does with with other pedals I have.                
Just bought this to get cool guitar and bass sounds to record using my Tascam DP-01......So far it seems cool,but I will need time to play with it(I will do that while I am on a glorious 10 day vacation)                
So far,so good....I will need time to tweak it                
Got this bad boy for 26 dollars less than Musician's Friend.....I am done with them and my local Guitarcenter......(They tried to screw me on a Marshall JCM 800 that I wanted to trade for some equipment)                
It is a cool metallic red.....bad to the bone

A compact and light pedal comparable to the sound of much expensive boutique pedals. 
If you're on a tight budget but looking for high quality sounding analog delay, VD400 would be the best solution.                
Just like any other vintage analog delay pedal, the three control knobs are easy to use and tweak to get the sound you are looking for in an analog delay pedal.                
Its made of plastic, but industrial grade ABS plastic; the same material used on motorcyle helmets, and other impact resistant headgears/safety gears.                
With the price, this pedal is a winner among the analog delay pedals.                
No problem so far.                
Its the sound. Did a test with the Aqua Puss, and couldnt tell the difference when i closed my eyes.                
Works perfectly and sounds great. For 25 bucks I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I typically dont buy " cheap" products but youtube videos on just about all the Behringer pedals sound fantastic. Took a chance on it and glad I did. Gives me that slapjack echo delay I needed to tune in that Johhny Cash/Luther Perkins tone.                 
I've only had this about a month or so, but I like it!! For the money, this thing works like a charm, does exactly what it's supposed to do, nice little slapback-type delay, and gives a nice full sound. I'm sure it could be tweaked to do more, but I was quickly able to zero in on the sound i needed. I use this mainly for harmonica, but it works just as well for guitar. There doesn't seem to be any volume loss when the pedal is turned on. I like the two separate outputs for effect signal and dry signal (two amps is always fun)
Yes it's plastic, but good, thick, sturdy-feeling plastic. I don't foresee that being an issue- simple as not being abusing the gear. 
I'm sure spending the extra $100 or more will give a lot more tricks and variety. I was a little nervous since the price is so low, and these days it's hard to find quality for this price range. So for us musicians who have to make every dollar spent really count, this is great!!
If you looking for a delay and cant seem to find one cheap here it is. from Atmospheric to Rock-a-billy this does it.                 
Got mine today. For 25 dollars I'm very pleased with its performance. Im generally wary of buying " cheap" products but for 25 bucks I took a chance. Bought it to get that Waylon Jennings sound and it delivers. Watched many youtube videos where this cheap pedal performs just as well if not better than the MXR Phase 90. Spent a few hours with it today and very happy. I expected it to be very cheaply built but surprisingly it is made pretty sturdy.                 
Awesome very clear highs and punchy bass love these PA Speakers                
These Shipped Quick Theyre Nice And Sturdy Very Clean The Speakers Boast Exceptional Highs Very Bright! And Good Bass Response We Installed It At My Church With A 1000 Watt Amp (Samson S1000) With More than enought power since these are 150w Program Each And The Amp 500w Each Chanel At 4 Ohms the power drives them wild the sound is impressive i know audio because i engineer! Good Bang For Your Buck!                 
Very good sounding monitor for the price 
I have 8 and have only lost one due to rough handling from falling (magnet shifted)
For the price I couldn't buy the parts to build this for this price                 
The speaker construction could be a bit more robust in the magnet mounting department 
Which makes this monitor more fragile than most  But if you take care they are fine and hold up well                
Pretty simple plug and play not much EQ needed                 
Great box weak magnet mounting to frame
Sound quality great for the price                 
Great deal for a beginning band or sound company on a tight budget this works                 
The support was great to work with but in some kind of transition so a replacement speaker basket took 6 months to arrive But support was good                 
Looks good well made                 
I've got almost a year on my monitors and hope to get at least 1 more out of them before I sell off and update 
For the price I'm very satisfied                 
I have been using Behringer equipment for many years and all have been virtually trouble free.  My bass amp is a Bugera, GMX110 modeling amp, Europower PMP6000 mixer, (2) VP1520 main speakers,(4)  VP1220 monitors, (3) 1800xms mics and (1) 8500 mic,  I also have a Shure Beta 58 mic ($180) and it is no better than my Behringers.  I have also had a Behringer GMX212, GMX210, (3) GMX110 and their 300 watt 15" combo bass amp as well a 6 PA speakers and 12 channel mixer that I lost in a fire.  In all the years I used them (a lot of gigs) I only had to replace the 1/4" input jack on one of the GMX110s.  Admittedly, the tuners were off some, but I used Korg inlines anyway.  I will choose Behringer products over the high priced "top of the line" equipment every time.  First class equipment with a price that a poor country boy like me can afford.                
Highs not that high lows not that low and mids a little muddy, but the price is right. Guess you get what you pay for.                
I have used Behringer speakers before so this was no exception. It's got all you paid for ,Plus. I'd buy them again. I use  my VP1520 PA SPEAKERS with 2 Behringer 18's Subwoofers  and of course my 30 channe; BEHRINGER PMP 6000 and I rock everybody;s world. Lots of POWER.
             .                
Simply awesome on all scores, and in all environments.                
Solid construction, portability, quality materials.                
They're speakers. They work great.                
These are constructed great. I could not ask for better, and certainly not at such a great price.                
This is an awesome deal!!                
I have not called customer service pertaining to these speakers, but I know that zZounds has awesome customer service.                
After much research, I still feel that these are the best choice for the DJ on the go!                
These are great speakers. I do not anticipate and problems with them, ever, due to the units themselves.                
No!                
I play the bass guitar, i sound good!                
It's not hard at all!I never used any other product! Sorry                
Yes!Very Good!I Hope for ever!                
Yes!                
Never!                
Outstanding!No!                
I bought my speakers a year ago OUTSTANDING the sound and clarity is so sharp, you just have to here for yourself, when i do my inside gigs i donot need all 4 of my spearkers just two will do.                
Amazing for the price. Boom Boom gigs out, this sub is perfect for large audience. The sound quality is outstanding. I am thinking to buy another one to send to my country. (Haiti)                
Peefect, everything is OK                
Its like Plug & Play                
Cannot be better than that                
Worth it                
First buy no complaint                
Well made first class material                
No I am stick with Behringer                 
I am by no means a sound specialist, but these subs deliver with the right combination of amps (QSC GX3),frequency crossover, quality speakon cables amd subwoofer. I have tried songs with deep base and explosive sound effects, and long before the amp indicated clipping the walls and ceilings were feeling the deep bass.                 
Ability to daisy chain 2 subs for ultimate punch was sweet.                 
Just plug in to amp and go. Just pay attention to limiters on amp.                
The overall speaker configueration is nice. Two things I would add to make it more to my liking are:
1- Protective rubber covers for edges
2- Make coasters an available accessory. I added 4 with locks and it makes a difference with mobility and keeing the carpet cover higher off ground when there are spills on floors at party.                 
I thing Zzounds made my day with their pricing and shipping cost. I dont have much disposable income and these are worth every penny I spent.                
did not contact                
Just get it, you would not be disappointed.                
I hope to maximize the use of theis product for years to come. I may add another pair of these bad boys to rock larger parties.                
Bought these to replace a set of Harbinger subs. Really liked the Harbingers, but there is NO comparison. These subs have a killer bass response. We play metal/alternative and they are a great addition to our set up. Our sound guy LOVES them. He says the difference in our sound is like night and day.                
They got an 8 on this because all the literature (even the stuff FROM Behringer)says it has Speakon AND 1/4" connectors. Mine has ONLY Speakon connectors. Don't know if it's a mis-print, or mine are oddballs. Either way, I bo 1/4 adapters and all is good.                
Uuuuhhhhhh.....pretty straight-forward...1 in 1 out.....                
Very well made. SOLID as a truck. And MAN are these things heavy. Like around 100-125 lbs. each. But all that weight makes for a GREAT tone!!!                
You will NOT find a better sounding sub for this price. Listened to several all the way up to twice the price of these and they didn't come CLOSE to sounding as good as these.                
I own several Behringer products and have never had a problem with any of them. So I can't comment as to support. I've never had to use it once in the past 10 years.                
Really like the sound ports in the bottom of the face under the speaker.                
Plan on getting a lot of shows out of these. If they were lost or stolen. I would replace them with the exact same thing.                
first off i dont give 10's  because nothing is perfect...  these do sound good.  I have been running them in a live band setting and they are holding up well.  Driving them with 3000 watt rms  amp  2 pair,,   they are  short throw 18's  and i have a pair of long throw  so i have the best of both worlds.  Compact units, Need to add wheels for easy of setup,,  i have experienced better tighter low end when these subs are crossed at or below  125 hz.   overall  very good quality and price  and  by the why the rms on these is only 400rms  so make sure you are running them with clean power of at least 550 rms                 
none                
I bought 2 of these to use in a bar venue where we do live music and karaoke and these are wonderful. Nice low tone and plenty of thump. I have two of them running on a crown xls2000 mono bridged crossed at 118hz. and they sound great. Only have speakon connections so make sure you have the right cables or adapters.
We may get Two more for another venue we work at. I would recommend these to anyone looking for some inexpensive subs.                
I ordered a pair as back ups. Sounds incredible right out of the box (to my amp of course). This pair did the job on the low end for a 150+ gig. Nice and compact but my only thing is its black carpet not vinyl coated. On the other hand, Shipping was great because I got my shipment a day early which was a BIG +. If your on a budget start out with these bad boys.                 
This passive sub is excellent! Has the deep smooth punch I was looking for. The price was perfect and its a nice piece of equipment sturdy, well built pushes the bass across a room!                
Once again zZounds comes through with the fastest shipping, the best products, and quality service !!                
So far I am very pleased with these subs. A little heavier than expected but well worth the price!                
At higher volume the speaker makes a cracking sound,  so our church has decided to continue to use it,   just making sure the volume level is kept to a more normal level where it sounds okay.                
Overall it seems to be a reasonably performing subwoofer,  at low to moderate volume levels.                
Sounds are just fine as long as the volume level is low to moderate.                
Product has major flaw in that all the weight of the speaker bears down on the lower under structure members,  underneath the speaker.   These wooden members are actually not wood but rather weak particle board and therefore subject to cracking and coming loose,  which is exactly what happened to this unit -- cracked and also disconnected at many joints.                
Yes.                
No I have not dealt with the manufacturer.                
Appeal is good,  but only because it looks powerful,  when in actuality it cannot perform to a high level of output due to cracked speaker and cabinet.                
Product was advertised with cosmetic blemish, at a reduced price.  The listing did not include a specific description or photograph of the cosmetic blemish.  When the product was received I noticed significant structural damage at the base of the subwoofer cabinet,  just as the reviews stated often happens with this model.  zZounds stated they would not offer any refund of money, nor file claim with the carrier,  but would only supply a replacement after I shipped the product back to them at my cost,  which would be significant if done properly.                
I just finished building a dual sub woofer box to hold two 18" daytons. My budget wouldn't allow me to purchase those subs at the time, so after some research I discovered these speakers and the payment options, so I took advantage of it. After receiving the speakers I immediately hooked them up one at a time using a nu3000. I immediately noticed the rattling sound. The whole left side of the front buffle wall was vibrating. After investigation, I discovered the box wasn't even MDF. Long story short, the carpet was pretty much holding the box together in both subs. It's been about two weeks worth of glueing and reglueing. I also discovered mold in one of the boxes upon receiving them. On the day of discovering all the issues I contacted customer service, they send a ra number shipping label. I decided not to wait another week on more speakers and to try to fix the problem myself. Because I'm sure I probably would have received another set of low quality speakers. I now have them somewhat together and they sound a whole lot nicer. You get what you pay for. After all my work I'm happy!                
I bought a pair of these to use for smaller rooms.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of sound they produced.  We had another band play our stuff so we could get out and listen all through the room, and they kicked a$$.  I powered these with an IPR 1600 Peavey amp, and had them paired with some Peavey SP2's.  They do sound good.  Only down side was the ad and the manual showed them with both speakon and 1/4 in inputs but the y came with only speakons.  Zzounds sent me a set of cables to rectify the situation.  Great service!                
I purchased a pair of these to replace a set of Peavey SP 118's to reduce the volume in our trailer. I was surprised at the quality of sound these speakers put out. I am powering them with a Peavey IPR 1600 amp. they are paired with a set of SP2's. I tested them with our band playing throough them and another band as well, so I could get a good feel for them throughout the room. Medium size room with around 250 people and coverage was good.Only problem was the ad showed them with both neutrik and 1/4 in inputs, but they only came with neutrik. This was easily remedied when I called Zzounds and they immediatley sent two Neutrik cables.                
I am a mobile DJ and I must say I am totally impressed with how AWESOME and CLEAR these speakers sound, I have always liked the sound of QSC but I bought 4 of these barely pushed them with my Behringer iNuke 6000, all I can say is WOW !!!  (after the cops came to my gig to turn it down !!! ) The dual 15's were so nice and DEEP (Great for R&B, Down South Soul & Hip Hop I played for that client) I didn't need sub-woofer and I am VERY impressed, ordering more soon for the club. For the price and sound, built very solid (NOT cheap particle board) you can NOT go wrong...Period. .I can honestly see why so many TRUE artist love a passive set-up instead of powered/active speakers...Especially hearing your voice coming out, which is superb, bye bye QSC..                
I recently ordered a pair of the VP 2520 to daisy-chain with another pair of columns.  They arrived, I added them to the sound chain and fired them up.  As an addition to my existing speakers, the VP 2520's add a new dimension of crispness clarity, punch, and sonic acuity to the music. Vocals are crisp, clear, and the VP 2520's handle the full range of vocals superbly. Until there's opportunity to play outdoors, there isn't a need for sub woofers.  Between the existing columns and the new VP 2520's, there's more than enough bass and bottom end to satisfy.  I can see adding another pair, and using the existing columns as monitors.  Given they're a 2000 watt speaker, an additional pair would be perfect in terms of the wattage I'm striving for, with the PA System.  At present the system is at approximately 4000 watts.  Yes, these are heavy speakers, and a hand truck is a good thing, but when you're dealing with Marshall 1960 Cabs, it's not that much different.  Quality is as one would expect, flawless.  You can pay a lot, for your speakers and get the same sound quality or you can pay what these cost and get the same sound quality...  I recommend these for any level of musician or band, whether just starting out or having been playing out, awhile.                
First, Zzounds give's musicians an opportunity to own good equipment with different payment plans option I've been a user of behringer products now for more than. 10 years..
The speakers sounds great, the delivery was qick ,and you cant beat. The price! !!                
I have been using a pair of the Behringer VP2520 speaker since 2011. I bought a second pair three years so I only use the old one for outdoor gigs. Now the infor:First the VP2520 are carpeted covered over particle board. It is well constructed and the particle board has held up very well over the past seven years. Though the carpet along the bottom of the speaker will wear out quickly.I use the VP2520 with two Crown XLS1000 power amp operating in the mono bridge mode. In the bridge mode Crown rates these amps at 1100 watt RMS. I never run the amps into clipping. Most of the time only the first two LEDs on the meters are lit when I am playing music. Even when used when I DJ high school proms this amp/speaker configuration easily provides sound for 500 plus students. Plus note I do not use the VP2520 below 100HZ. I use to JBL dual 18s operating at 4KW to 6KW. By removing the low end from the VP2520 they perform better. Additionally I use a DBX Drive Rack speaker management system. This help makes the VP2520 sound even better.Issues: Over the years I have had the following issues with my first two VP2520:1. The carpet tears easily. Always keep Elmers glue handy to make quick permanent repairs.2. An internal brace came a loose. It wasn't broken so I was able to fix this issue. See #3. 3. One of the port tubes fell into the speaker twice. The second time I repaired this I took off the grill and removed both woofers. I also found and fixed the internal brace that had come a loose.4. The rubber feet need replacing. The original feet were held in place with one wood screw. I replaced the screw with a bolt, two washers, and a nut. You will have to remove the grille and bottom woofer to complete this task.These were the only issue to come up during the seven years I have been using the VP2520 in my mobile DJ service. I use these speakers every weekend.Simple put, the VP2520 is an outstanding value (at least the way that I use them).I have use the VP2520 along side my JBL SRX tops and the VP2520 did very well.Technical detail: System A: two VP 2520 powered by two Crown XLS1000 BridgedSystem B: two JBL SRX725 powered by one QSC RMX4000.From the listeners stand point there was not difference in the sound. The SRX725s were able to play the same sequence of music 3 dbs louder than the VP2520s. Is 3dbs worth triple the cost? Probably not.                
The product performs very well. I have karaoke business and the speskers provide very good sound both audio and voice.                
utilize speakon connections for connection.                
plug and play.                
Quality is excellent                
The product is well worth the price paid.                
Haven't had to use support for this item.                
Will continue to use product indefinitly. Would replace with like item. Have had nothing but good experiences with Behringer Products.                
Love big but not too big I'm mobile so that is key but quality is everything love these                
Great sub, I use it for guitar and Behringer electric drums.  Also hook my phone and or laptop to it and a Behringer B110D (also great PA speaker).  It sounded OK running my laptop directly to it by means of a 3.5 to XLR cable.  But once I got the Behringer xenyx 502 mixer, it made a big difference.  Before I  had early clipping and had to have my speaker and sub volume almost all the way up to get anything close to loud.  But after the mixer, loud and clear and very powerful!                
I have two of these. I also have two JBL JRX15 on top. These VQ1500D work very well to create a good balance of mid low and highs. If you are looking for something with some real punch I would recommend finding something larger with more power. Overall for the money these subs are well worth the money. They are built well and sound amazing in a small venue.  They tend to clip even when the level is in the mid to lower ranges.                 
I've owned a pair of Behringer B215d speakers for 18 months, and they've held up well, even though as a resident club DJ, I gig with them three nights a week. They still sound great. 
So I already had a good impression of Behringer. I believe they offer lower priced products that are definitely competitive with the higher priced brands.  So recently when I decided to purchase a new sub to add some extra bass to my existing rig, I really didn't consider any other brand. 
I bought the Behringer VQ1500D, and I'm very glad I did.  I can't believe that a sub priced this low offers such great sound! The bass is thumping, and with the Bass Boost function, you can push em even harder. I'm telling you, get one or two of these for your rig you won't regret it!                
so i dj at a bar and needed some bottom end bass i gone with this sub due to i have a set of the vp2520's what i like it the speaker is small and only 400$ and is self power and bass dose sound clean but what i dont like is you turn the level knob just a little bit and the clip light is on so i wish it could have some more of a kick to it but for the price its not bad for a small bar or wedding even a school dance it would work but for mid + size club i would go with something else                 
The behringer VQ1800D Active Subwoofer has an amazing low responce, that's the reason why i purchase another one to match my first purchase, i like it very much and it's very easey to set up. thank you so much zzound and their staff for shipping my order ontime.now i'm using it to my dj sound service and our audiences at the party's are very please with its sound quality.Thanks, jed r.                
I purchased the Behringer VQ 1800 for medium sized wedding venues in which I provide my DJ services. I used it this past weekend in a 3200 sq foot wedding hall with 20 foot ceilings. The Behringer performed very well paired with my 4 powered 12 inch speakers, and reached the dance floor (20 feet from my set up) with punch and full sound. So far, I am more than pleased with this subwoofer.                
Well this subwoofer really does the job, off course there can be another options but for the price range  the quality is just amazing I used it for church or other presentations and it just really surprise me, I play piano and when it comes to combine the bass player drumms and keyboards it works perfectly very clear!!! The only thing that can be better is the cable is to short at least for me.                
Not as loud as I thought it would be however it gives a serious 'thump' to our band's kick drum and bass. We're a working blues band and wanted to add some more bottom end and this sub works just right for us. We're not an overly loud band to begin with, so this gives us some more depth. This will work good in the small dives we play, and when we play big venues and festivals they have their own sound, so this is just right for us.                
The metal grill seems like it should protect the speaker well, and since the Fed-Ex man threw it off the truck onto my driveway, I guess the metal grill works just fine. Not much else to it, a few knobs, a plug and a switch. Simple as can be.                
Plug and play. We are just using this to give more thump to our bass and drums, and not even going through our main mixer for it. Simple as can be. Mic the bass amp and kick drum directly to the unit. Works just right for us.                
Some folks deride Behringer stuff, but I have never had any problems with any Behringer products ever. Bass amps, power amps, mixers, speakers, for many years and never had a problem. All my Behringer stuff always works, never let me down, and even if this unit fried, I would still buy Behringer stuff, based on all the gear I have from them which has been flawless.                
I purchased a scratch and dent unit, and other than the above mentioned issues, it was a great deal on a good product. I'd buy another.                
Never had to call or work with the company, never had an issue with any of their products.                
It's a sub woofer...wow... :-)                
Purchased a scratch and dent. It arrived in a box that looked like it was dropped from a plane, every piece of foam padding broken in little pieces, and the bottom foot broken off and stripped from the screw hole. Manual missing too. However, it was advertised as scratch and dent so with a little wood glue, and a toothpick fixed the broken foot issue. Can't complain based on the discount I received, coupled with 10 minutes of repair work. The unit itself looks and works perfectly.                
Very good speaker for the money.I am selling mine because it was to heavy for a 63 yr old man to be transporting around.But you cannot go wrong with this product.Great strong bass sound coming out of it and when you hook up the other 2 speakers to it, you get a nice rich sound coming out                
Wow factor !!!I added one subwoofer to my DJ system and the lows were very impressive, so impressive, I just ordered another one plus subwoofer poles so each top speaker will have its own Sub. Thank you zZounds for the awesome customer service.                
Pros - These speakers sound great, solid bottom and crisp highs.  Not too heavy to heft onto a tall stand, angled sides tilt for use as a monitor, they can be used as monitors or mains - I use them for both.  Love the metal grille.
Cons - The side handles need to be flat w/ the sides for the speaker to be used as a monitor,  these stick out some.  I'd also like a Speakon jack besides the 2 - 1`/4" jacks, but that's just being picky.                
I received my VS1220 3 days ago and immediately hooked them up. I am running them through a Peavey powered mixer. The power rating for the mixer is 200 watts RMS. When I first hooked them up I was satisfied but not wow'ed. To be fair I needed to spend some time and tweak the EQ to get the sound balanced. Then I decided to run them in bridged mode. This is when they came alive. They needed more power. I am now very pleased with these speakers. This kind of sound from speakers at this price range is incredible. My only small issue is that the highs are too bright and have to be turned way down to balance the sound. They may be better balanced with a compression driver. The final word is "BUY THESE SPEAKERS". For the guy that does occasional DJ'ing or small band gigs- they are an incredible value!!                
Great Sounding Speakers, very light, and have deep bass response, and vocals are crisp through the as well, i have the pmp 2000d mixer/brain/ and i run mics and instruments through these and they are loud and crisp, great products from behringer,  love em,                 
I bought a pair of these to replace a couple 15" Behringer molded speakers. They were just too heavy and I was too lazy to haul them around anymore. I'm doing quieter 'adult' type gigs now, and i don't ned the high power speakers. These speakers are compact, light, and you can carry a pair of them easily. They sounded great at the New Years gig I did, and I never pushed my new Behringer mixer past 4 on mains, and 3 on monitors, using a 900 watt 10 channel mixer. I have an older pair of Behringer VS1220 monitors, and I noticed they have a much brighter high end sizzle, but they also use horns instead of tweeters. So, I do a single solo act and use backing tracks and play guitar and sing. I had two of these set on the stage floor facing out, and two monitors facing up at me. For the dinner set, I was almost only on the monitors, using the mains for filling out the sound. I aimed the mains almost in a baseball diamond pattern, 90 degrees. The people I play for want to hear the music but don't want them pointed at their faces. Later in the evening I cranked the speakers up and they performed well except that I had to crank the high end up on the mains, my new speakers, cuz they didn't sizzle like the older Behringer monitors. These speakers were perfectly matched to the Behringer mixer, and none of the equipment ever seeemed to be strained or distort, even at loud volumes.                
Two ergonomic handles on the sides, easy to lift and compact. However it's worth noting that I did have one handle snap off one of my 3 year old monitors, how that happened I have no idea. When I looked into the hole where the plastic handle went, it looked straightforward to fix. Nice sturdy metal grates, fuzzy animal grey covering, sturdy rubber feet. These guys, like their predecessors, are sturdy and I expect them to last a long time.                
Plug and play!                
For the money you won't find a better made, high quality value for a speaker. I punched these little guys on New Years Eve and they cranked out the volume and low end and it was surprising how much bass they put out. Make sure you get a good high powered mixer to match these guys. 
The manual like with all Behringer documentation was well written, extensive, and clear. The speakers were packed well, plastic wrapped and taped, and had extra padding in the boxes. You get a Behringer bumper sticker in every box. I've heard people slamming Behringer products over the years, and I've only had one speaker arrived DOA. They are well made, sturdy, well thought out, and perform beautifully for the money. I've bought Behringer since 2003 and this is going on seven years of customer satisfaction. I just bought a Behriner GMX110 guitar combo from Zzounds and that also is excellent for the money. Buy it, you won't be unhappy, i promise.                
Behringer uses the same factories as Mackie and other name brands, or should I say the other name brands use Behringer factories for their products?! All their stuff looks unbelievably nice and high quality for the price.  I've been buying Behringer stuff since 2003 and push my equipment hard on special occasions. The stuff works tough, with spirit and keeps pushing out the music as much as I push it. When I was younger I used to worry about name brands now I buy what is the best value for the money. And I think Behringer is getting quite a good name now that they've gotten control of their quality control over production. You will not find a better value for the money. Period.                
Sent them a couple questions and they emailed me back a couple days later. Friendly, informative and made sure I understood the solution. One time I had a failed Behringer effect, and they directed me to a store that sold Behringer, and I received a brand new replacement and the store mailed back the defective unit at Behringer's expense. Good service.                
these speakers look great and sound great. they make me sound sexy! seriously the stuff looks very professional and clean on stage. I've been performing since 1970's and owned it all. this looks as good as any of the stuff on the market.                
I can probably use these speakers for years until I decide to sell them to someone else. The other pair of Behringers I got in 2003 are still going strong in another club down the street! If you're comparing these to another similar size by other brands, save yourself some money and get thse. If you're that worried about the name on the cabs take the grill off and unscrew the logo. But you will love these little guys. They have soul and will work hard for you.                
This is my first time ordering from ZZounds and ordered 2 of the Behringer VS1220f Floor Monitors and I am blown away. The sound is superb. I don't know why people put down Behringer, they put out a quality product, at reasonable prices.                
I love this company, Behringer is the @#$%! I have been building my studio using almost all of their product great value and this speaker sounds great. i bought this for the drummer in my band to use behind him as a monitor                
Good sounding floor wedge monitors.  Not the same quaility as my JBL's but they still sound good and are the fraction of the cost.                
1/4" jack....wish it had speakon                
Plug and play...what else is there?                
Can't answer this yet...only had them for a month now.                
Like I said...for the money you cant beat them                
NA                
I like the wedge design....but there is only one handle on the monitor, makes it sort of ackward to carry.                
As long as they dont blow...I plan on using them forever.                
Excellent sound, excellent quality, excellent value. I'm thinking to buy all sound
system for my Church from Behringer                
We bought these floor monitors for our son's startup band. They require a speaker amp to operate, but look and sound fantastic! One of the great features is the cross connect feature, which allows each speaker to power another. They seemed to be priced on the low end, yet seem to be very high quality. We're new Beringer fans, and will likely go back to them to add to the band sound system.                
These were pretty impressive. Good quality of sound at any volume. Price is nice too. Purchased 4 for our band and was a great investment. I have 2 name brand higher end monitors also and these sound just as good as they do for half the price.                 
Works great. No problems                
I bought two of these. One was to be blemished. The only difference was a small dent in the metal grate cover that did not effect the quality of the product.                
I bought this speaker for our church but did not know that there was not a volume control on the speaker. The quality was good but I had problems when I hooked it to our mixer. It could not handle the extra load of another speaker and therefore " slowed " down the song. I wished it had a volume control but it didn't so that lead me to returning it to the store. The people helped me a lot trying to find ways in which it would work on our mixer. But in the end , I returned it to the store for a refund.                
No, it did not have a speaker cord with it so you had to buy one if you did not have one on hand. Also, as mentioned earlier, it did not come with a volume control knob. The sound was great even though it did not have certain features as mentioned above.                
It did not have a volume control knob to change the output. It would not work well with the mixer that we had at our church.                
When I opened the box and picked up the speaker, I noticed that something was loose inside. I don't know what it was but when I returned it to the store, I did mention that there was something loose inside the speaker.                
The value was good.                
 The people were great to try and find ways to help you with your problems. I would still buy from them.                 
It sounded like a great speaker and it was when I listened to it but it did not mention that there was not a volume control knob.                
The quality of sound was great and the price was good but it did not have a volume control knob on it. And it did not work well with the mixer we had at our church so I decided to return the product which they had no problem with returning it to the store.                
I got a pair of these speakers and they sound awesome. I thought I will need to get a subwoofer to go with it, but to my surprise, I don't need one. These speakers alone have lots of bass and they are long throw, the further you are from the speakers, the harder the thump. Believe it or not, I use these for home stereo and TV surround sound. 
I was a little nervous when it arrived, the boxes show some damaged outside. I was there when the Fedex guy deliver it and I mentioned  to him that there were some damges to the boxes and he asked me to open the boxes infront of him incase there were damaged inside the boxes, but there were no damages to the speakers. They all came in one peace and not a single ding or dent. I was very happy that zZounds use Fedex instead of UPS. I could have ordered these from Amazon, but there were so many horror stories about UPS delivered the boxes damaged so bad that the speakers came in pieces and many had to be sent back. I plan to order the Behringer subwoofer from zZounds soon eventhough I don't need one.
The reason I bought it here is because of so many good reviews about this company and their fast shipping. I am glad I did because it is everything that the many good reviews said about them and I got my speakers in 3 days. I will definitely recommend this company and I will buy from them again.                 
Nice deep bass, the other reviewer is right. Don't need a separate subwoofer. I love these speakers. When I received it the first time, one was defective. Called zZounds at night almost 10pm. They picked up and put an RMA ticket in right away. Got another one by 2 days. I was surprised at how helpful they were. Love the zZound service. I've been using them everyday. They sound excellent, highs and lows and all. Would recommend to buy from zZounds. Would buy it again if they do stop working somehow. Nothing wrong so far. I am very happy with the purchase.                
Just got my speakers,got them hooked up,and wow ,they sound great. Has agood build quality.great bass and highs,would definitly reccomend for a friend to buy.also delivery was prompt and damage free,only took 3 days.                
The sound is totaly amazing it sounds better I think then my mackie 600 watt speakers and i paid three times as much for the mackies.My 1520 vs berhinger the lows are awesome the highs are awesome they sound great for any style of music country rock blues metal jazz i just wish I knew how they did it I will be buying more of there stuff soon      Thank Berhinger                
yes chords                
great sound all the time                
very nice looking speakers                
best bang for the buck                
Have not needed them yet                
tryed them out and had to have them                
for a very long time it will be hard to top these speakers                
Use Behringer gear most of the time. It is good gear at a good price. 
A great buy I will say..however..I purchased a pair but when my order arived I only got 1? Not 2! And I had a gig booked for the same week..I was not notified at the the time of the purchase or anytime after that I would only receive just one..so to say the least it put me in a pinch..it wouldn't have been bad if I'd known before hand that their policy is first come first serve on these restock items but I had to find out the hard way..and as a result they apologized but made no attempt to find a comparable item and satisfy the customer..I can't stay in business doing that and they won't get my business again.                
I personally love the sound. Again, though, I don't play out. This is not something I use for stage. I bought the VT999 solely to warm up the sound and give me good tone response going into my PC. It performs perfectly in that role.
With the gain on the VT999 around 5 to 8 I can get some rich, luscious, overdriven tube sounds. Less if I only want some crunch, or 10 if I want some full-force overdrive. The noise gate on the VT999 works excellently! And it's very simple to use - just like a basic stomp box. It can be barely noticeable or it can chop up your notes if you like that. I keep it dialed back a little and find that it works very smoothly, but effectively. Admittedly, my EMG pickups go a long way towards a noiseless sound, but the VT999's noise-gate adds a perfect final touch.
I haven't tried replacing tubes as I find that I love the way it sounds in my current arrangement. It responds just like older tube-amps I have used in the past, with beautiful tones and rich harmonics. However, after reading other reviews, I am curious to find out what other tubes can do for the tone. The idea of it being a starved-plate pre-amp is not detrimental to my purposes.
Most importantly, the pedal doesn't suppress my guitar's own tones. Those still come shining through no matter how I have the pedal set.
A huge downer, though, is that you simply cannot get a good clean sound. No matter where I set the gain and volume controls, I either get a mild crunch or the sound drops out altogether.                
I find all of the features are well thought-out for a 'cheap' pedal. You have the tube - the heart of the sound - and the EQs and noise gate, and of course a master volume. The bypass switch is very smooth - NO POPS!!                
You have to be an idiot to not be able to use this pedal straight out of the box. You plug it in and set the knobs to whatever you desire. If you've ever used an amp, you can use this thing.                
Well, the casing is built like a tank. It's solid and nothing rattles.
Yes, the knobs are plastic, but as long as you don't throw out of a 5-story apartment window or let your 4-year-old bang on it with a hammer, it should survive most road use.                
For my purposes, this pedal is a great value.                
Haven't had to use manufacturer support.                
Tube-in-a-stomp box ... for under $100.
And it works.
This has earned a permanent place at the front of my guitar chain.
But then ... my name is not Bonnie Raitt or Eric Clapton.                
I'm not a true guitar player - my thing is keys. I have my own little PC-based home studio (doesn't everyone, these days?) and I compose and record my own stuff. I use Elec Gtr to fill out critical parts in certain blues and rock tunes I record, but I have no stage amp and I never play out.
For me, the VT999 serves as a tube-based preamp going into my PC. I have an old Epiphone Strat-style guitar with EMG active PUs. I go from that into a Boss Compressor/Sustainer (CS3) pedal and then into the VT999. From there, I run it through my Digitech rack processor to add a hint of delay if I want, and then into my PC interface (Onyx Blackbird). I use the guitar channels/effects in my recording software to further fill out the sound as needed.
I personally love how it looks. It has a unique, almost retro appearance. But that really bright blue-LED light does annoy the h#!! out of me.                
This is simply the best starved-plate front-end I have heard yet.  This is my first Behringer product, and I have no prejudice against the company as many seem to.  I also have built several single- and multi-tube preamps over the years.  This pedal's circuit design is a success.  The stock tube was unimpressive, bland, and murky; but still not the worst distortion sound I've heard.  I substituted an old RCA 12AU7, followed by an old, generic 12AT7.  Wow... Each tube completely changed the character of the pedal.  The tone controls enabled dialing in the optimal settings for each tone.  Mind you, I've had the pedal two days, and I'm running it into a Digitech RP200 (to add a touch of reverb--that's all!) and straight into my PC with its tiny speakers.  IMO, this only increases the challenge for the VT999.  I was extremely impressed at the variety and musicality of the tones I was getting, with little thought or effort.  And I want to emphasize something---many players buy a distortion pedal, crank it to 10, and bang on power chords during their evaluation.  Even the WORST products sound decent when you do that.  The real test of this type of pedal is when you dial it back and listen carefully to how the sound breaks up as you're just starting to overdrive the tube.  Bang a chord and listen as it fades to clean.  Such testing separates the good distortions from the wannabes.  The VT999 does very well in this department.                
The VT999 is simple, straight-forward and does what it says.  I haven't used the noise gate feature yet, because it is so quiet.  It's nice to have, though.  Comes with AC power.  Sweet.                
I haven't read the manual yet.  No learning curve at all.  Just get yourself a Phillips screwdriver and scavenge a few old, used 12A_7-family tubes and do a mess of swap-and-listen sessions.  (BTW--forget about NOS tubes at this point -- until you home in on a favorite, just stick in whatever tubes you can find--stuff you may have pulled from Granny's Philco radio, etc.  If you find one you really like, THEN worry about hunting down a few NOS tubes of that brand.)                
Solid construction outside, absolutely adequate and typical inside.  Nice spring clamp for the tube.  Some find the spring too tight.  Mine seemed just right.                
The sound is fantastic.  BUT it only does one thing, so I think its typical selling price of around $70 is a bit steep.  But IMO it's a pedal you will use a lot, so that must figure into the question of value.                
Unknown                
I don't "lust" after equipment anymore...I'm too old.  This pedal is not particularly pretty, but it sounds incredible.  THAT'S what attracts me to it.                
If lost/stolen, I would immediately replace this pedal.  It makes me want to play, which is high praise.  Since it is simply a distortion pedal, it does need some sweetening with back-end EQ and reverb/delay.  In my experimenting so far, I'm not sure if I would attempt to use it as a DI box, but that would require more testing.  I'm eager to hook it into the effects loop of my Carvin tube amp.  If I had to change anything (practical) about it, I'd be interested to hear a version of this pedal with a higher plate voltage.  I bought this pedal because I know from experience that low-voltage tube circuits can work, but most are executed badly.  The reviews I read told me the VT999 was different.                
The pedal sounds really nice, it's very responsive to even the slightest of changes in the settings. Is doesn't have a really variable sound, as it will always stay quite warm and round, but thats also the case with almost every tube overdrive I've come across...
Someone may dislike the true-bypass on the pedal, but it suits me perfectly...                
The pedal is very straightforward - it has controls for bass,mids and treble, and has level and gain knobs. Also, it has a very usable noise gate with a threshold knob and an on/off switch. The power supply included in the package is also quite reliable, as I've used it with a lot of other pedals...                
Its very simple to make the wanted sound, a matter of seconds, really.
The presets in the manual are quite logical and usable, also...                
The casing is robust and can be kicked around a lot, so its very usable on tours or for constant gigging. I've had it for around 3 years and it survived some 20+ gigs and countless rehearsals. Only thing to watch on are the knobs which are made of hollow plastic and aren't replaceable.
Some pedals also have a faulty tube in them, so try out before you buy them !
Also, the blue power LED is too bright and will annoy the hell out of you if you use it in low-light situations (I've put gaffer tape over it)                
The pedal has a great sound for a very low price in comparison with other tube overdrives out there.                
Never had the need for it...                
It's a love-hate thing with this one - some think it looks very retro and like it, some think it is ugly and looks like a russian sewing machine - a matter of taste on this one.
It could get a better combination of colors, as this dirty-white with a giant black V gives it a cheap look...
In my case, I don't mind the look as long as the sound is right.                
I play a variety of genres (from electronic-rock crossover to grindcore) and this pedal has proved really useable for all of them. If it died on me, i'd buy it again. I may need another dist pedal with a more synthetic metal sound, but this one will remain in the setup aswell.                
I bought 2 and they both have inferior tubes. They barely light up and take 5 mins. to warm up to where there's no static. It muddies your clean tone and there is no touch sensitivity. The distortion is fantastic. Noise gate and EQ are great.                
I already have a good clean tone . I wanted this to add the tube feel to a ss amp. With these tubes it just can't get true clean, even with gain on zero. It is built very well with metal housing and jacks.                
It takes some adjusting to dail in.                
road worthy.                
Half the price of others.                
Have not called yet.                
Fully adjustable tube dist. for my solid state amp. Nice.                
This is worth the extra 10 bucks for a new tube. Maybe yours will have a good one. I am going to try a 12au7 for more clean. I am keeping both of mine.                
Got this to go low gain and sweeten a solid state amp. Put a lower gain tube in 12at7 and it does fine. Really shines when you scoop the mids and crank it, but I don't play that way! If you want 70's rock distortion, look no further.                
Buy this pedal if you want classic vintage OVERDRIVE sound. Then order a JJ ECC83/AX7 from Tube Depot and you will have a nice pedal. The Bugaria tube that comes with the pedal is definitely junk. For only $69.99 this pedal is a steal.                
 this is a great pedal to have around with solid state amps, but it shines when being used along with tube amps. I looking forward to purchasing more tubes. I bought an extra tube when I purchased this pedal since that really is the beauty of have tube devises. You can really experiment more with such pedals and amps and the overdrive is always better and distortion is always better sounding. This pedal is a great entry level pedal into the tube world. But kids this is not a real tube amp replacement. All tube amps are something very special in my book and has got me more way more into playing and sculpting my tone. This pedal is very interesting when you have a few tubes to experiment with. I wasn't that happy with the stock tube with my particular set up. I hope they make more pedals like this one.                
First and foremost,this is a "starved plate" circuit,which means that the 12AX7B Bugera tube that comes stock with the VT999(or any other tube for that matter)is not really getting the adequate voltage to work at full capacity.The good thing about this pedal is that it is a 9volt power supply,and it will integrate easily onto your board.Some would say this is a bad thing because it needs more power.I think Behringer has a winner here,but you need to change out the stock tube because it is a high gain tube,and the signal/notes "choke out" at lower gain/volume settings(which to me is unacceptable)After trying a few different 12AX7 types I settled on the JJ ECC83,which is slightly lower gain than a normal 12AX7.This tube worked for me really well tone-wise although I now have to turn the master volume to at least 8(almost all the way up)so the VT999 can keep up with my amplifier(Bugera V55 head)I bought this pedal to be a substitute for the gain channel on this amplifier which I thought was lacking.I only use the CLEAN channel on this amp and with this pedal,and I am very pleased with the results.Yes,you could probably find a better tube overdrive pedal out there,but it wont be 9volt power,and it wont be $73.00(I bought mine last year for $57.00 so look out the price on this unit is GOING UP...)I believe this overdrive pedal will work best with amplifiers using a 6L6 tube platform running a CLEAN signal into the unit.                
This pedal is very versatile,and all the controls work.For a classic rock sound keep the gain at 2:00 and turn the midrange to about the same,with the bass at 11:00.The treble control really works too so you can adjust the brightness to compliment YOUR amplifier.To achieve a more aggressive "metal" tone,your going to have to put a compressor in front of the VT999,and turn the gain and bass up-while dialing back the midrange.This is surely enough for ME.If you are looking to achieve a "death metal" sound this pedal may not fit the bill,and there are probably better choices for you out there.The noise gate works well,but I don't use it because again the notes tend to "choke out",however if I played a heavier style of music,I probably would use it;anyway it's nice to have it there as an option.                 
This is where this pedal shines.It just can't get any easier than this.I did take a magic marker to it to mark all my settings I use- but hell,I do that to almost ALL my pedals.BTW,a Tube Screamer type pedal after this thing works wonders to get you that "over the top" tube saturation tone.I run my board in this order:cable from amp,tuner,delay,compressor,VT999,Tube Screamer,modulation effects,wah pedal,cable,guitar.Just FYI.                 
I definitely would not beat up on this unit,because the control knobs go all the way into the pedal,right into the circuit board itself.This is not the usual pot/shaft/knob deal here;this is another Behringer "cost cutting" move that I've seen on their pedals before.The circuit board itself looks sturdy enough,and fairly simple.In fact,opening up the chassis and seeing all the room inside makes you wonder why they didn't make the VT999 smaller.??????Things that make you go "hmmmmmmm".....The unit is a steel box,and it seems very durable,just don't be stompin' on the knobs bro.On/off switch works beautiful,never had a problem with it yet.Time will tell.....                 
You can't touch a pedal like this for under $300.00,and it comes with a 9volt power supply and a noise gate built in.You're going to have to do some tube swapping IMHO,although I've seen some reviews where the person says the stock tube works best-not for me though.This is not the best tube overdrive you can buy,but it works for me and the price was right(and still is).For the money this is a steal.                
I don't think Beringer services any of their products,the best you could hope for is a replacement,or warranty from who you bought it from,or send it to Keeley or some some other mad scientist to get it fixed or modded or whatever.                
Beringer products will never have "sex appeal".However,I can tell you that I'm starting to see this unit at gigs-people are using it,mostly as a substitute gain channel on a 6L6 platform.                
I'm getting a really nice guitar tone with this thing,I've tried other pedals(solid state/modeling I.E.:metal zone,crunch box,fuzz pedals,distortions)and they just don't have the harmonic "richness" of a tube powered pedal.I don't really NEED anything else right now,I'm kind of pleased with the sound I'm getting from the VT999.Go figure.                
Seems to work well. Have not compared it to similar product from other brands. Still experimenting with settings.Like the control setup although am concerned about how plastic parts will hold up over time.good value if it holds up well.                
All i got to say is don't let the name fool you. just because it's not a boutique or highly recommendable brand doesn't mean it's trash. I would call it a overdrive/dist driver. It does it very well. I am glad i am here to witness what a good dist/drive box it's. Lets not be arrogant, this is a tube driven box. hello, it will replace some of your drives shockingly.                 
Let me see, tube dist/overdrive, noise gate, decently responsive controls. HHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMm not bad behringer.                
Fairly easy, it can be versatile and compliment your tone. do not try using a daisy chain with this pedal you'll suck juice and tone from it. don't be retarded, use the power supply given.                
I am giving it an eight only because the knobs are plastic and straight into the circuit. everything else is legit and good quality.                
A good value apart from the knobs. the price, sounds, and options make up for it.                
haven't called. The spring it comes with inside popped. i accidentally pulled hard on it so be careful it is a tube box...hello.                
I have it and like the vintage x-men graphic look alike from a marvel comic book. Born in the '90s.                
If this were stolen i would replace it, it has a good sound. really that's what counts.                
I bought it a while ago and it sounds great to me, but beware: this is most likely of the "starved plate" category of tube drivers, running at a low voltage. Google that if you don't know what I mean.
Other tube drivers like the Seymour Duncan have circuits that really utilize the tubes, but those were too expensive for me.
I went ahead and bought an Electro Harmonix 12AX7 tube after hearing that the behringer tubes are unreliable and sound bad, but personally I liked the stock behringer tube better than the Sovtek (behringer was softer sounding with less high gain) I could definately hear a difference, which means the tube can't be completely for show.
Overall, to my relatively untrained ear this pedal sounds great and gives me what I think is a nice tubey sound, and I'm glad I bought it since my solid state amp's OD can't compare.                 
The wall mounts are solid and avoids unecessary vibrations.                
The wall mounts are designed for the specific Behringer speakers that I had on hand. Accessories to hold the monitors were included.                
The wall mounts were easy to install with the proper screws from a hardware store. Mounting the monitors to the wall mounts was easy.                
High quality steel, well designed.                
Yes                
No problems                
Nothing sexy about a wall mount.                
I like the product, but the price could br lower.                
I have used this in only limited settings. I am very pleased with its very low noise floor. I have used three different type microphones: condenser, dynamic and acoustic guitar transducer pickup on stringed instruments. The transducer has the worst noise issues but can be EQ'd out fairly well. I also have a dual CD deck feeding into the mixer with no noise issues at all.                
For a relatively small board it has a host of excellent mixing capabilities. I got this unit for its FX capabilities and was not disappointed at all.                
I rate this a little low only because I had to go online and grab a block diagram from another similar unit. The manual DOES NOT come with a block diagram and there are so many nice features to use that without the block diagram it is not at all clear how to use them well. After I got the block diagram and only a little learning curve I have generally mastered the board.                
I have not had it too long but I was nicely impressed right out of the box. Everything seemed very solid-all the connectors, sliders, knob-pots, etc.                
For the mix options available, the flexibility and FX it is a great value.                
This steady mixer sounds great.
As I value ease of use very much so, I bought this mixer, expecting it to deliver me less headache then my former ProTools Set-up.
And it did! ProTools is history for me, now I use this mixer, combining it with the ultimate user friendly production software Energy XT 2.5 Plus. The results are phenominal! Even the reverbs sounds great, ass well as all the other features in Energy XT. My advice to all is, learn to use and experiment a lot with this set-up, and you'll be nicely surpriced how professional it actually works! It made me very happy to finally get rid of my over-the-top Protools Setup and start working intuitive instead. If you go for creativaty and inspiration, and don't want to let it get spoiled by endless menu's and difficulties, then this mixer, together with Energy XT, is the thing for you.                
Comes with standard software Energy XT (producing and recording software), but I bought a seperate package of Energy XT 2.5 Plus software. Together with the 1204 FX USB mixer it works wonderfull!                
In one word...........easy.
And all the highs and lows can be put right in the mix and recording...on the spot.                
Hasn't let me down                
Great value for the money!                
Buy it!                
i was surprised at how well the mic preamps sound on vocals,and the compressors are a sweet bonus. i've only used an allen & heath mix wizard16 live, and was very pleasantly surprised with the performance of the xenex 1204usb. it has made my home recording a smooth operation with the energy xt software, so...if you only need a few channels for live performance, and want to record with ease..you need one of these!!!                
I wanted a USB mixer with effects.  This mixer makes that happen just fine.  In my case, I work from a computer.  I use the USB port to channel sound from my computer into the mixer.  Then output the mixer back into the computer's sound card.   It does this flawlessly.   The effects are nice.  The mixer is good quality.
I wish I had some control over the USB audio.  I don't have any control over EQ or effects on the USB input.  But honestly, this is not necessary.   
The only complaint, if this is even valid, is that if I have a mic muted, with effects enabled, the effects are not muted.  I still hear echo or whatever.  I have to use the slider, not the mute button, to get a clean mute.
I bought this as a zZounds scratch/dent item.  This item was clearly open-box, but it was flawless in every way.  No visible signs of use or damage.  It was a tremendous value.
I wish it has blue led instead of orange.  :)
Overall, highly recommended.                
Once I figured out how to adjust the echo...its been GREAT!                
More than enough for my purposes                
Easy to work with.                
If cared for, should last years                
Pleased with quality for the price                
Haven't had to use as of yet.                
Compact but powerful                
No issues                
i was very curious how happy i would be with the xenex x1204usb, since i've been using an allen & heath 16 channel live for 8 years. but, i have to say i'm extremely pleased with the sound, both live and in the studio, with energy xt2.6 software it's perfect!! the software that comes with the 1204 is energy xt compact, which you can use to practice your recording, but the sweet part is, the upgrade to energy xt2.6 full version is only 19 euros!! all the other recording software upgrades like ableton etc...are hundreds of dollars. get this package!!!                
It lets me change and corect sound                
I love efect 14 it is pitch so i get a song take the voice change it to higher pitch mute some set my mic on 14 and say something diffrent as i record and it is sweet                
I rate this nine out of ten because iam nine so its hard to figure out but once i have its easy                
This will last 30 more years then i will get a 24 channell mixer                
yes it was worth it                
have not used it but is probly great                
it looks good with the pa its cool and will be even more in case                
28 years then i will make music and will need more channels                
this came with no software included. I believed it was supposed to come with energy xt, , amongst other things, per the behringer website. I got nothing, and now may have to return my mixer to get another one with a box that does include it? hopefully? I am in a bit of a hurry, so this is frustrating. I have a deadline. I still want to work with these products, but I just don't have the time to send things back and forth. I was happy that my call was answered by a live person, but he will have to do some searching to see if I can be supplied with only what was missing, or pack what I have all up again, and send it all back, to play a long waiting game of receiving, then sending out what I had ordered. A bit frustrating, to say the least.                
I was looking for a rack case that had a few spaces available for effects/CD player(s), but also accommodated a top mounted mixing board. This was really the only one I found that suited my needs in the price range I was targeting. The removable top, front and back panels give you great access from every angle and make it easy to quickly change patch cords, etc.                
It's easy to pop off panels and get them back in place. The only complaint I would mention is the cord access holes on the sides near the bottom rear of the case. The spring action to keep them in place or remove them is poorly designed. Spring doesn't stay put and comes out easily. I could recommend not bothering with them since you can easily route your cords by removing the entire rear panel                
Well made and looks good too. It looks rugged and I'm sure will last for many years of gigging.                  
Good price for this style rack.                
I like this case much better than my previous rack mount case, it fits everything I need to take on a gig and makes my system look more professional. Since I'm a solo Frank Sinatra tribute singer I'm almost always on my own at gigs, and this rack makes it easy for me to walk in with one case and a set of powered speakers and be ready to go in a few minutes. Only minor complaint, it is kinda large and a little rough for one person to carry when it's loaded with your gear, since the handles are recessed on the sides and a stretch to get your arms around.                
The sound from the mic inputs are crisp.                 
Plug and play even for the most novice.                 
Seems like it will last for a while, very sturdy.                
For the price this is an excellent piece of equipment. It does what some of the more expensive doesn't.                
Didn't have to use it.                
I love the design; I like that its compact easy to carry around.                
I will use this product until my venue calls for a larger one.                
This mixer is brilliant! I am able to record on my pc with no latency  using the inbuilt 16 bit 48kHz USB sound card . I now use the desk as the main recording source for any instrument with ease and combined with the inbuilt effects some very professional sounds can be easily achieved.
Effectively your pc can be used without a sound card with this  mixer as the sound can be redirected back via the USB return. 
At this stage I do not use this mixer for live gigs but I can tell there would be no issues.                
The mixer has inbuilt effects and  effect send/ return that can be sent  to any channel.
A good compressor is built into each channel.
Phantom power is available for any mics that need it.
There is only one thing I miss - no solo buttons on each channel, but for the standard of features this mixer has I can overlook this.
A Behringer ASIO driver is supplied but I use ASIO4.DLL with no issues so far.                
The controls on the desk are simple to use (even for a novice)
It may take a little while to figure out how to set up effect parameters as the instruction manual isn't clear on this, but again it isn't difficult.                
The desk is well constructed and attractive with good quality connectors, knobs and faders. The main mix send has gold tipped male XLR connectors.
As long as the unit is stored in a road case for transportation it should fair up as well as any other desk for live work.                
Great value for the features.                
I haven't had personal experience with Behringer yet but a close friend of mine has and he has nothing but praise for the efficient way his mixing desk was quickly replaced ( 3 days) when a fault was detected in it.                
It's a very tidy looking mixer, not too large so it fits well in a home situation.                
This mixer has all the features I require for my home recording and for what I payed for it I am very satisfied.
I chose Behringer under recommendation from a friend who owns a complete Behringer PA system and loves it.                
First of all, the product works as expected.
There is noise at very high gain settings, but it pretty quiet below about 75% of the gain range on any given segment of the mixer.
Used mostly with phantom powered mics and direct boxes with great results.
I thought it was noisier, but it turned out to be some poorly made XLR cables.                
Unbalanced 1/4" Main outs would have been nice, but it works great with XLR balanced line outs...and cheap adapters are readily available.
Bought this for USB track recording for roughly the same price as a 2 channel XLR in/out USB dongle of the same quality.                
The mixer was very easy for me, but for someone not used to mixers, a more detailed manual would have been great.  Also confusing is that the manual covers two mixer models.                
Fit and finish are very good.  I wouldn't take it on the road without a hardcase or a rack box around it (brackets come with the product for rack mounting).                
Yes, at 50% of MSRP or less, it's well worth it.                   
It just works and has a reasonable layout...but it's a generic hunk of gear that does it's job.                
Hope to use it for the next 4 or 5 years...currently I would replace it with the same unit and the same cost.                
I bought this to replace a similar model I have had for several years and needed two extra channels. It is a great mixer with lots of features..and sounds great. Very quiet operation. I know you can only put so many features in a mixer of this size, but I do wish that there were channel mute buttons on it. That, however, does not take away from the excellent value of the product.                
Best mixer I have ever owned hands down.                
Bought this for a one man show using backing tracks and occasional karaoke shows. This unit outperforms my expectations. Feature rich for the price point and everything works as advertised. Very pleased!                
Great little mixer for computer recording or small band                
Built in compression an EQ                
Plug it in and it works                
Everything seems solid and works                
Try to find anything close for the ptrice                
Had a different Behringer mixer that failed, Behringer sent me a new one no problem                
So far so good with this. I just got going with it and I like the quality, onboard effects and preamps and compression. Affordable and pretty quiet for what it is.                
I got my 16 input Behringer mixer this Christmas fro my diabled wife.. I have pwered speakers and this mixer is Great..But, when I got the board (one of my main reasons) was to download the softwire and record on my computerThe specs say (comes with ALL the recording & editing software you meed toturn yourPC inti a  complete high-performance  home recording studio..That was NOT TRUE..On the box it said to doenload FREE software  from Behringer.com and there is no FREE doenloads..My mixer should have came with the mixer like it said..I think it was a trick to get you to buy it and then lied about the software..Never buy anymore music equioment from them again,,I am very angry about this,but thr mixer is good,at least I am trueful,,,RickMcKean                
this little thing will satisty all your needs if you're like me, a one man performer or simple 3 or 4 piece band... I love it.. compressors ... nah.. not what I wanted.. but I use sonar X1 so got kool compressors with it.. great deal for the money...never happened to call the menufecturer so rated it anyway...                
Just from putting the headphones of my choice on AKG k240s and listening that way, I thought the sound was nice and pure. The mic I used was an AKG 414 TLII (the gold one) at least to say this little board did not insult me in any way. Next to the board is my big blue pre Focusrite ISA 430 MK II which is obviously hard to beat. At the end of it all the EQ, compressor, built in effects, its a nice package, and if you know how to use gear properly there should be no problem!                
As far as a compressor goes it does what it does, I have not had it long enough to say what I would use them for.                 
For the money, it smokes!                
I have been doing a lot of recording with this board. The quality of the recording is just as good or better than the Allen & Heath board I've been using in the studio. The preamps in this board are nothing short of amazing.
It is loaded with lots of very useful effects. Reverb, delay, chorus, compression, EQ, etc.
All of the effects are very high quality. The reverb is especially good. Very natural and rich. 
It takes some patients to get it linked with the computer. Be prepared to use a cable to hook up the first time. You will mosr likely need to update the firmware and download usb drivers from Behringer. This is all easy to do and only takes a few minutes.
The PC app is great. Very intuitive. The Android app is also very good. Not as user friendly as the pc app but makes mixing on the fly easy. I prefer the pc app for detail work like fine tuning effects.
Overall, this mixer sounds better than any I've used. I own a Mackie and a peavey. I've used Yamaha, Allen & Heath and other Behringer boards. The only one I've used that sounds as good as this one is the Behringer x32.                 
This is my first sand alone ALL digital mixer so I have nothing previous to compare it to. Having said that my only warning to anyone looking at this is there is a relatively steep learning curve. There is a USB port for multi track recording to a computer or iPad, but the audio signal path is access ONLY thru wifi on a computer, iPad or Android device. Getting past the wifi connection, the depth of control is massive and can be overwhelming. Every channel has built in phantom power if needed, a gate, compressor, EQ, Level, Panning and 4 Aux sends. On a physical mixer, this amount of knobs can look intimidating, and in the digital world it can be equally so. Getting past the complexity, the main reason for this device is the amount of channels and the quality of the sound.  For the price, I don't think anything touches the number of inputs and the quality of the preamps is far greater than the price would suggest. The channels sound clear and clean with no noise even at high gain levels. There are a lot of videos online that give tutorials on how to use this beast and be prepared to watch them as mixer has very little included documentation. But that's what the internet is for right? There is a better manual/web page online as well. It may not be simple, but it a great piece of gear and except for the complexity, I can't imagine anyone being unhappy with this mixer's quality and flexibility. 16 input channels (all individually record accessible), 6 physical aux sends, dozens of effects for delay, reverb, compressor, eq, overdrive, leslie speaker and more, midi and USB connectivity.                
I received two weeks ago and waited until I purchased a tablet to download the X AIR App. It took me 15 minutes to figure out the basic mixer functions. All I can say isWOW!
The music sounds at high volume levels like the band is there. I have it feeding signal to two B15x powered speakers and it so impressive how each instrument is audibly accounted for. The bass notes can be attenuated ratio to mid-high frequencies for spectacularly well balanced sound reproduction. I have set the speakers to neutral settings across the equalizer grid and set the frequency crossover points with the xair personal settings.I will never need to experiment with another mixer. True digital fidelity.                
This mixer works very well. I wish the reverb was a little better but maybe I haven't played around with it enough.                
I'm really happy with the amount of features this thing has. It's got compression and a low cut on each of the mic inputs, a good amount of effects, and a 9 band eq. It has more features but those are the main things I use and can remember at the top of my head right now.
And not only is it a full fledged, versatile mixer, it also works as an audio interface! So that's two for one! You can use it for live performances and also at home for recording. Or even recording at live performances!
I've looked around a lot and did a lot of research and couldn't find such a feature loaded mixer for the same price as this one.
I use this mixer with a shure pg81 mic and behringer b212d speaker to amplify my flamenco guitar. I need something with more control that's why the 9 band eq is so useful. Plus every room and situation is different so that makes the 9 band eq even more useful. A typical 3 band eq just doesn't cut it.
If you play something with a lot of dynamics, the compression can really help to set the right volume level.
The reverb sounds a bit funny to me. I need more time to get used to working it. In some rooms, it sounds great, in other rooms, not so great. I'm sure this is just me needing to work with it more. I've heard other reverbs from other mixers and they weren't that great sounding either.                
It's pretty simple to use if you've worked with mixers before. The layout is simple and straightforward.
You might need to do some reading if you've never worked with a mixer before to really get all the use out of this thing, but that goes for any mixer.                
I'm pretty impressed with it so far. I've had it for about a month now and have been gigging at least once a week with it. Let's see how it works out in the long run.                
I think I got a LOT for the price of this mixer. Well worth the money.                
It looks pretty good to me. Everyone always looks impressed when I take it out to set it up. I guess all the led lights make it look pretty high tech and cool or something.                
I'm really happy with this mixer and won't be needing to upgrade anytime soon. Like I said before, I wish the reverb was better but that could totally be just me not knowing how to use it to it's full potential yet.                
I love the subtle sound changes, that I can elicit from the keyboard and hear with this mixer. My vocals reflect all the modulations I am capable of voicing! If you can sing, this board really does the job. You can modify the effects (reverb etc) and you can fine tune where and how much is employed- GREAT!                
Nine band EQ- FINE! Feedback finder combined with the 9 band EQ reduces the wide swath cutting that occurs with fewer bands!                
Learning curve is short- very short. Instructions are basically 43 pages of basic information in 6 Languages- ugh! You can download the full Behringer manual and you are set to go! I repeat, my Casio PX-560 sounds awesome, crystal clear and all subtle changes are heard in this mixer/ ditto vocals!                
It appears well made. I take great care of my equipment, so I expect it will do very well. Time will tell.                
Best value to cost mixer on the market. I have been in and out of music since 1964!                
No contact                
I could make good music without it! But- I make BETTER music with it!!                
Have had this mixer one week. This is an incredible device. Tons of headroom, crystal clear sound from my piano (Casio PX-560) and great vocals (Shure SM-58 Beta). The effects are very good (you can adjust parameters). EQ (9 band) is great, and the controls feel good- no slop. Compression, works very well, and the feedback finder s a great aspect. In actuality this is a 10 channel mixer (6 XLR/ 1/4 inputs) and 4 stereo) But for me this is no problem. The mains are XLR and I wish the monitor out was as well (I use QSC powered). For $249.00 this is an incredible mixer. Time will tell how it holds up. But, I have nothing but praise for this device!                
So far, a really decent mixer. The effects are great. It was easy to set up and get going. I haven't tried to connect to the pc for recording as of yet, but will be doing so soon. Used for a party and 5 musicians with mics, guitars and a keyboard.                
Behringer Xenyx X1832 USB Mixer has been reliable. Very pleased with the performance, I've pushed it to the limit and it performs great.                 
If you don't care about using the USB port for recording, this is a great mixer for the price. However, I am not probably 48+ hours invested in trying to use it for recording. Have tried their EnergyX SW that came with it, and two other recording SW packages I've used successfully with MAudio products, and I still cannot record. Playback was a cinch. But I've downloaded and installed the Behringer ASIO drivers, the ASIO4ALL drivers, and nothing is working. So I'm wondering if I have a bad USB port in this brand new mixer, or what? And I'm a 25 yr veteran with the largest IT company in the world, I know a little bit about computers. :-)                
Can't get the USB to work with recording, playback is fine.                 
Mixing and live sound if fine. Works as it should. Manual could be a lot better in describing how to adjust the FX parameters. Would have been nice if Behringer would have offered a software interface via the USB for adjustment and storing of the FX patches/parameters.                
Quality of the mixer main controls and chassis seems to be fine, probably better than most at this price point                
I'm disappointed I still can't get the USB to work with recording, and trying to make up my mind whether I was to return it or not.                 
Not easy to get answers from Behringer. They force you to search their FAQ on their website.                
It looked good, had all the right functions in a compact mixer.                 
If I can't get the USB to work on recording, I'll have to buy another USB recording device, and would likely choose something that comes with ProTools SW.                
I bought this mixer for live use in my band space and for small gigs so that I don't have to carry my big mixer and effects rack. I love how it sounds.                
The effects and built in compressor are both great features.                
Very intuitive. I played with it for about 30 minutes the day I got it, and had figured out everything that I needed to.                
I've only had it a short while, but it seems sturdy enough.                
For the price, this is about the best thing out there. It also came with some recording software, but I use Pro Tools, so I haven't put it on my computer.                
Haven't had a problem.                
It is much smaller than my other mixer, and it has way more features, though the inputs are somewhat limiting. If I have a big room gig, I will have to carry my full set up to mic all instruments, but for rooms where vocals are all that need to be amplified, this baby is perfect.                
I would buy another if it was stolen.                
great sound for the money. love the new compression control knobs                
mics and music from computer are used most because of karaoke gigs  reverb is also used a lot                
never had problems i have two of these                
Ive had this mixer for about 2 weeks, i love the looks of it, and it is completely functional with plenty of inputs & outputs that you might need. The manual however, lacks something to be desired. Not everyone is a sound engineer, so for those of us who have limited knowledge of inserts, subgroups and so on..not to mention the various combinations of buttons that need to be pressed or left alone...the instructions came up short.  I did manage to learn most of it simply by trial and error....something i don't normally like to do.  So far I am very happy with it, Behringer helps those of us that don't have serious bank to continue with serious music.                
I use this for a karaoke/ live guitar/ vocal on stage. This is more than adequate for a club band and it is very quiet. Plenty of in/outs, dual busses and very professional sounding. Plenty of EQ, just enough monitor sends and it has effects but I don't use them. I use a lexicon effects unit which is much better. If you can't afford an outboard effects unit the built in ones are more than adequate. Most club bands don't need more that eight xlr inputs and there are four stereo channels to boot. F or the price this mixer can't be beat.                
Perfect addition for a home studio. I like being able to record from the mixers usb directly into my computer. Just go to the Behringer website and download the free audio driver so your recording software will recognize it, I'm using Magix recording software.
On the Behringer website hompage: click on support, then click drivers, then click on USB audio driver that has your operating system listed then download and you're ready to go, Now you can use whatever Mic you want along with instruments, you name it, very versatile. Great for a studio on a budget.                  
We've been using this mixer for a few weeks now and are very happy with it.  The effects aren't particularly impressive but are a little better than those on the Mackie CFX12 it replaced and the monitor out is a great deal cleaner.                
Good mixer for this price, I use it for my internet radio show and it give me versatility that I need to record form Mic to computer.                
Came fast and safely packaged. Coming up on my second payment and received a notice about it. Everything works perfectly.                 
I've had it for three days was mad as hell with it. But took some time to mess with it myself. And found out it. Works the only problem I had was recording and hearing the music at the same time. But figured out what it was. On mines don't know bout every one else I pushed both trs buttons in and pow. It was doing the job flawlessly. And I didn't change the driver for it. In sonar x3. Or had to highlight a lane to record. I guess the only time you have highlight lanes is if you are recording with all outboard equipment. Thinking bout ordering one more. You can't go wrong it. Take it from a producer,artist, and mixing engineer.                
It is a great sounding mixer. Almost no noise, great headroom, and great sound coming out of it.                 
The effects processer is great. The four aux sends are more than come in most mixers in this price range. It also has four subgroups, another feature most mixers don't have in this price range. It also has direct outs on eight channels and has inserts on all the channels.                
Very easy to use with any mic or instrument. I've used some different mixers and, apart from and Allen & Heath mixer, this is one of the easiest mixers to understand and use.                
Great preamps. Knobs and faders are good quality and can take a beating. All the inputs and outputs have quality connectors.                
Fantastic value! No mixer I have ever seen in this price range has as many features as does the 2442usb                
Anything you don't understand, Behringer's website has something on it to help you out.                
It has a very beautiful look to it. Behringer redid the colors and look of the 2442usb compared to the older 2442fx, and it looks great.                
I plan on using this mixer for a very long time, as long as it lasts, which will hopefully be a very long time.                
Hey gang. Semi-pro musician here. I have owned various Behringer mixers, amps, headphone amps, and other miscellaneous gear over the last 10 years and I gotta say I love this company! I'm REALLY waiting for the UFX1604 but it's not out yet (Behringer...it's been almost 3 years...hello??). Anyway...my older UB2442FX-Pro had a few channels go out and for the price to fix it I figured might as well get something new. I'm used to the amazing number of outputs, sends, groups, etc., (from the UB2442FX-Pro which is a very similar chassis and layout), but what really intrigued me were the compressors. I have a female vocalist with a LASER like voice. Her dynamic range is very wide which is good (and she does a good job controlling it), nonetheless in smaller rooms I don't want to cause nosebleeds with high volume notes. So on our first gig with the Xenyx X2442 USB, I dialed in compression on her channel to about the 2:00 position. PERFECT! I believe the term for the compression algorithm they use is "soft-knee" which usually means that the compressor kicks in gently rather than those examples you hear where the compressor "breathes" in and out. Whatever the terminology, the compressors on the X2442USB kick in such that you almost cannot tell they're working but they definitely ARE working. Her laser voice is capped and doesn't exceed the threshold and overall, our live performance has indeed been enhanced by the use of the compressors on this board. I love the effects as well. VERY nice reverbs. We don't use the other effects much mainly because we ALSO need some reverb on the keyboards and acoustic guitar...so trying to use the effect that has reverb AND delay wouldn't help us because I don't want that on the keys/guitar (again...waiting for the UFX 1604 which has TWO independent FX processors....Behringer...hurry up and release it!).Another interesting point to be made: I bought this "warehouse resealed" which knocked $40 off of the price. When I received it and opened it and took off the side "bumpers" (since I rack mount my mixers), I noticed about a quarter sized dent in the side of the mixer. I contacted zZounds via email and told them about it and they offered an exchange OR would I accept another $40 off? Wow! That is customer service ladies and gentlemen. On my part, IF I accepted the additional $40 off, I had to be happy with it and accept full responsibility (which I did...I seriously doubt anything can go wrong based on that particular dent...but ya NEVER know!). Anyway...great service.Finally...once I racked it up and hooked it into our PA as well as to a Behringer POWERPLAY PRO-XL HA4700 headphone amp (which I HEARTILY recommend), we, as a band, were off to the races. Great clean sound. Plenty of routing options. Plenty of gain on the mic channels. We record our gigs religiously via various means (direct out of the headphone jack into a Zoom Q3HD as well as multiple Direct Outs, Group Outs, etc., to a Zoom R16 multi-track) and believe it or not, as long as we are mixing well in real time, the direct stereo output to the Q3HD sounds GREAT! This has the potential to save us time since there is no post-gig mixdown from the Q3HD (like there is with the R16). Alright...I've talked your ear off...but if you're considering this mixer, stop stewing and buy it. You will never look back! Also...for those geeks out there (and I'm one of them) who are agonizing over the number of channels, number of Aux Outs, number of Group Outs, Direct Outs, etc., stop agonizing over the other Xenyx models that have LESS outputs and simply buy the King of the Hill in the X2442 USB. We're talking about a difference of $50-$100 between them all and you WILL need the extra outputs/channels some day...so just DO IT.I have SAID my piece and counted to three.Sincerely,Kevin B. Selby                
I use this board for live performances to mix everything from our vocals to electronic drums to piano & keyboard. I've rigged it to feed our PA amp with a separate feed for sub-woofer. The board is versatile, well built, quiet, has great effects and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. The one thing you need to get use to is the "British" equalizers. But once you get the knack, you're off and running.                 
The effects are great. The reverbs, delays, chorus, etc. offer a real selection to choose from. The board layout is very straight forward and intuitive and there are enough inputs to satisfy any small to medium sized band.                 
As I've said, it's very straight forward. If you're a smaller band and don't have a sound man, it's easy enough to set up and get the right sound... set it and forget it.                
I've had this board for over 2 years now... no issues. 
I have quite a few other Behringer pieces of equipment... no issues.                
If you're on a tight budget, this board delivers more bang for the buck than anything out there.  Ignore the nay-sayers.                
Because I also have a powered mixer, I once ask how the "power output wattage" was rated. I quickly got a response but it was a "song & dance" as they said their rating couldn't be converted to "continuous average watts" or "RMS" values. (C'mon guys, it's only math...I guess the low number would embarrass them.) 
But at least they responded quickly.                
It was a great buy... so I got it.                
My first Behringer mixer was a powered mixer which I stated in another review to be a waste of money. I said "get a decent power amp (QSC, Crown, Peavey, etc.) and then get THIS mixing board."  I followed my own advice and haven't been sorry. This boards got all the features I need and it works perfectly, day in, day out.                 
The X2442 is exactly what we needed to to improve our sound and to add additional elements to our performances.  At first the vocal group and the band had to have two separate systems in order to perform.  With the X2442 USB Mixer we can combine the mic's and all of the instruments on the same mixer cutting down setup time and sound check time, and that to us is a blessing.                 
I used to use a Behringer X1222USB for my home studio but needed the extra channels of the X2442USB. I am very pleased with the 2442 however, the one thing the 1222 had that I wish the 2442 had is a graphic eq. The 2442 has lots of bells and whistles that the 1222 doesn't, not to mention the added channel space. Both boards work well in a home studio setting and neither one takes a degree in engineering to figure out, although, I thought Behringer could have gone a little more in depth with their owners manual. All-in-all, what a GREAT purchase at a bargain price!                
Very nice mixer, simple to use. Like the effects it has, and it's rack mountable. Behringer at its best.                
I have a lot of Behringer products and have had a great expierence with all of them. For the musician on a budget the price point can't be beat. This mixer was put into our show from day one and has performed as expected...love it!                
For me this is an upgrade from the Behringer Xenyx 1204FX/USB. Seemed like the logical step since I am getting great service from the one, I decided to take a bigger step to the top of the Analog Mixing Capability in this series. I especially like the sub-group capability so I can isolate my feedback prone mics and instrument mics. Can't justify a X32 but for me this is more than I need without having to just add inputs with nothing to plug into them. The subgroup capability alone is worth the upgrade....and the BNC connector for a light. Great piece of gear with lots of use and still useable foot print. Now I can take the smaller mixer on the road and have not had to relearn everything.                
IT'S ALL THAT NICE AND CLEAN                
I WISH IT CAME WITH THE NIGHT LAMP BUT IT'S FINE                 
YES THE PRODUCT IS WORTH IT I WANT ANOTHER ONE SO I CAN LINK THEM TOGETHER TO GET A BIGGER BOARD AT A SUPER PRICE PLUS I LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS AND THE FEATURES                
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM                
LOOKIN GOOD                
LONG TIME LIKE I SAID I WANT ANOTHER ONE SO I  CAN LINK THEM TOGETHER MAY 2
MORE THE SOUND IS HOT ,IT LOOK HOT,FEATURES HOT,INS AND OUTS ARE HOT,COMPRESSION ON 8 CHANNELS DO I NEED TO SAY MORE JUST BUY IT AND YOU'LL SEE WHY I SAY I WANT TO LINK 2 OR 3 UP TOGETHER.                   
Have had this mixer for about 5 years. Out the box I had 4 channels not work. Couldn't send it back due to no other mixer to replace it with for my gigs. Other than them 4 channels it has worked great. Everything else has worked flawlessly for my live concerts and shows. Oh have yet to try the computer plug in or software as much as I would love too I don't have time. But it has been good to me besides them 4 channel's out the box being out. I use it at least 3 times a week and it's been good.                
I am a Drummer .I use this to Sub mix my drums this into our main system.... good. punchy sound & clean .....then I also use it to do small gigs with no problems...They have stepped it up                 
I checked up on this mixer, the reviews are mixed, so with zZounds return policy, I took a chance. This is worth the money, Im in a few bands from 2 to 5 Insruments plus up to 4 vocals, works great and easy to use.....Buy it.                
The X2442USB Mixer is great for the price. I've purchased other Behringer mixers and they seem to have stepped up the quality a bit on this model. Even though it's missing the talk back feature you can still pick a free channel and us a microphone. It just works! The sound is clean and for the money and you probably can't find another mixer in it's class with all of the options this mixer has without spending more money.                
This is a well made, flexible mixing board with plenty of I/Os.  The microphone preamps are good, although require a delicate touch.  The faders have a nice feel, the effects are limited but useful. The unit has an internal power supply which is makes it easy to set up or transport.  It is also rack mountable.  Great value for the money.                
AWSOME CRISP AND CLEAN                
NICE SOFTWARE                
DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY THING  THE SOUND IS GREAT RIGHT OUT THE BOX                
ALL GOOD                
YES                
NEVER HAD TO TALK TO ANYONE YET                
IT LOOKS AWSOME LIKE A RECORDING STUDIO MIXXING BOARD                
NOPE KEEPING IT HOPE TO BUY ANOTHER SO I CAN HAVE TWO SIDE BY SIDE TO MAKE IT LOOK REAL BIG                
I find the board to be very intuitive and soooo quiet I thought it wasn't on! Musicians I have used it with love the sound!Planning on getting another bigger Beringer plus more of their speakers.                
Once again very intuitive. If you have ever used a board you can just start this one up and GO.                
Beringer is by far the best bang for the buck.                
I will add another board as aformentioned.                
I play drums with a variaty band and the versitility is unreal. Ican run 6 mics for a main mix, then run a monitor mix back from the main board for headphone use. Everything is seperate and clean. I just got the board but hte longer I have it the more I love it. The preamps and compressers give the drums a great punch. I use this unit with a 4-gate and the sound is great.                
Could use built-in noise gates for drum mix.                
The effects unit is awesome.                
Not much more to say except for loving it in the studio!                
This is long anticipated unit that does everything very well, sounds great, and at a very reasonable price.  I use it every week, and it does everything well.  With the new FW 2.02 it just got even better, a whole new collection of FX, great RTA, and few other things added.  Music Group really has been working hard at this one, and it beats any competition.                  
i admit. this is easier than most digital boards but people writing reviews about how difficult it is to use has obvioulsy never even seen a fully digital board.. compression is amazing as well as CAT5..                 
I am very happy with the performance of this console. I have been using digital consoles in some form since the 90's. The X32 is truly a giant step up from anything else in the entry level digital market. If you are looking for a desk with many "pro" features, this is it.  For digital newbies- I recommend setting the console up at home while watching the myriad of instructional/tutorial videos on YouTube.                 
I have been a drummer for over 40 years. Always played with bands that had a sound tech so never really had to know much other than helping setup and run cords. Started a new band and we had very little sound gear so I decided to invest in a board. Purchased the X32 after a lot of searching. Out of hundreds of reviews I only found a few that had anything negative to say. I've have had it about 5 months now and it is just an amazing board for the price. I did spend time getting to know the functions and features and it has paid off. Another great thing is if you don't know how to get around the board there are hundreds of great tutorials on you tube. Take the leap if you are considering the X32 you will be glad you did. Also as far as the reviews I have read about the manual being small, Behringer now has a full PDF manual available on their website.                
This is a great sounding desk very easy to setup and get going. Effects sounds great and over all performance is killer.                
Im very happy with my Behringer X32. It's as advertised. Smooth pre amps nice effects, I'm glad I purchased it. Zzounds thanks!                
Very surprising. Sounds great. No issues at all. If reliability is half as good as features and sound quality this console will be a game changer. Once this has been in the field a few years we'll find out!                
I mix FOH on one of these 2 times a week, in addition I own one that I use for live bands and a Live variety show for FOH and Recording.  It's really a great package for the money.  Dynamics on every channel and built in efx are great to have. The Firewire/USB card is awesome to have as well. I can record directly into pro tools without the need of additional interfaces.   I do wish it had additional Digital outs, though the Stereo. AES out has been nice to feed my amp rack, as I can stay digital all the way to the output of my x-over and speaker manager.    A Wordclock input would have been great so i could lock it to an external source, though at this price point, I understand why it's not there.   Overall I'm extremely satisfied with both of the boards. 
I've found the Mic Pre's to be pretty nice, and more than adequate for any live sound requirement.  I've done everything from Rock bands, to lectures, classical performances with it and have been quite pleased with the sound. 
Paired with the S16's it's a great combo.  Though adding a couple of those does significantly add to the price tag, I've found the reduced setup/strike time to be quickly paying back the S16's additional cost.   
I've not had to use Behringer's Manuf. Support, so I can't truthfully rate that. 
Ease of Use I think is subjective. I cut my teeth on SSL's and Large format Analog desks, and have worked on Digital desks since they showed up on the scene. As with anything there is a learning curve, and it's just a matter of learning how to get around it. 
If you've never used a digital console before, I'd highly recommend getting familiar with it before your first gig. It's pretty easy to get around once you're familiar with it .
The iPad app is handy if you want to check the mix in other area of the venue besides from behind the console.  The PC/Mac App is extremely useful I've found. Especially for adjusting Efx and entering the info on the scribble strip.                  
Through the years I have used some Behringer products, some good, some OK, and some well, not so good at all. I slowly phased out most through time, but I still have a few things. So when I made a leap of faith to the X32 it was definitely something I did my homework on. This is a great mixer in every way. I've seen some Presonus and Soundcraft digitals and would say I prefer this over them . A pro level platform all the way, compared to a :club" feel of the others. I had no problems with wireless control using a Surface Pro (though I do look forward to software upgrades). If you're looking for a pro level digi of touring grade on a budget, this is it.                
Sound is fantastic! The effects are easy to sculpt once you get the hang of it. It has a great ability to effect the sound just as you want. You can stack up to 4 effects on a single channel and that's great for my field.                 
Great features with the visual eq I wish there was a signal eq in it though. Or in ither words an rta meter. Again the effects are top shelf                
Easy to use once you work with it and going from an analog to this digital can take some getting used to. Main thing is don't over complicate it cause it has good ease of use!                
I keep having to tell myself it is not a behringer! This is a Midas all day! It's like the little brother to the midases though!                 
Great for value!                
TERRIBLE!!!!! Behringer a support is a phone loop of death that will lead you to no where and make up you end up smashing your head into the board until something happens. BUT if you call Midas they will get you squared away!                
Very clean and sexy!                
Great board overall.                
the best                
my experience with the beringer x32 is not that great till now, the owner's manual only has a few pages in english for it's tutorial.it's lack of good instructions very difficult to understand since they have shrunk it.;you connect its' output to the amps and there is noise.they should have made it easy as a analoge board.i am waiting to see if they are going to sell a tutorial dvd, which i have already looked it up but no luck, i try to go to you tube but the information i want doesnt show up.it is very difficult for and expensive equipment and you cannot use it because there is no help from the owner's manual.

Music Group really has been working hard at this one, and it beats any competition.  If you won't need all 32 inputs at the console, this does everything just like bit brother X32.  I am very pleased with it.                
This console is great! I was a bit leary about spending this kind of money on a Behringer product but it is every inch as good as everyone says it is. We use this as our main console in our home studio and our live mixer as well. Being able to save settings for our studio and different venues saves a ton of time. Wrapping your head around the routing is a major pain the butt at first but once you have it down everything is pretty intuitive. We had to call support a few times and they were awesome as well. They were able to work with a console on their end and gladly walked us through whatever we requested. On a closing note......... We have seen the x32 as the main console at every medium size venue we have played or been too lately.                
I used this board with protools 11 and studio one DAW and it works super great. Great Midas pre amp and no need for any external gear with this mixer. I used it in my recording studio and also have the p16m for my artist to hear and they enjoy every moment in the studio.                
I bought this mixer on the recommendation of a local pro sound man to replace a Presonus StudioLive16-4-2. It came highly recommended. This mixer is loaded with "bells and whistles” and is therefore quite complex, the owner’s manual is 74 pages, for example. It was really overkill for my application, a traveling weekend Acoustic Gospel band. I am really the only sound techie in our band, and I play bass. Our sound person is very inexperienced, and we use an ipad our front to mix sound. I was also looking for something a little more compact. I returned the board without even using it with our band.Here is my take: The X32 compact is slightly larger and heavier than the Presonus. I was disappointed in the laminated “scribble” strips, they were very hard to read. Another thing was the inability to assign the 16 main sliders to the 16 inputs all at one time, that is, only the first 8 sliders could be assigned to inputs (1-8, 9-16, etc.). Also a wireless router is required to connect to an ipad. Another I really missed was the lack of factory pre-sets for channel settings, etc.On the plus side, the mixer seems to be of very high quality, the motorized faders were ultra-cool, and it is loaded with features.                
I bought a board from these people sx4882 and they never corrected a problem in manufacturing that should have been by the time I ordered it and now I have crap board from a company that doesn't respond DO NOT BUY ANY BEHRINGER PRODUCT there's a reason why it's cheaper it's crap !!!!!!!!                
This is a very complex and difficult mixer to learn. It's not like you can power it on and go, like a hardware based mixer with actual faders and knobs. It's all done via an iPad. Granted you can used the onboard knobs to make changes but you wouldn't want to because it's a lot of pushing, turning, and clicking, besides the knobs not being inline with the menus makes it very difficult to use at first. But that's the initial "Hump" if you will, that you need to get over. Once you get a grasp of this amazing audio mixer, it is really pretty incredible. You'll spend some time watching YouTube videos and doing research since the manual it comes with may as well be taken out of the box and used to start a fire. I've never understood these companies (DAW's included) that send you these complex devices with very little instruction. You have to buy books, watch videos etc to even begin to use them. I made the mistake of trying to figure this out a week before our first gig. That was the most stressful week of my life. I did get through it and I did figure out enough to get the mains and monitor mixes working but it was no easy task. This IS NOT user friendly by any stretch of the imagination. But take your time, give yourself ample time to learn this and you will be overly satisfied with its features and abilities. Clean and quiet, and very very powerful. This thing has built in effects racks, you can use it to crossover your frequencies, there are eq's built in etc. You'll really dig this thing. Once you learn it. Believe me I almost said forget it and bought a normal hardware mixer with faders and knobs. But I stayed the course and figured it out. I'm glad I did. Love it now.                
After playing an standard set for almost 20 years it is a change to sit behind an electronic one. I bought this set to practice on but would not hesitate to use it in a gig. Setting it up was really quick, the sound that came with it are really good. I like the fact that the cymbals can be choked and that all of the pads are dual zoned, plus there is additional inputs for another drum pad and cymbal pad for later expansion. The brain is easy to use, easy to navigate and everything can be customized. All in all, you will not find a greater deal in a electronic drum set. I highly recommend this set.                
I've owned a few electric drum sets in my time (Alesis).  These are very good drums, great sound and features.  Real feel.                
For the money, this drum set seemed to offer a lot at first.  Indeed, if the unit were more robust, it would be a great value.  Unfortunately the set felt flimsy when I first set it up, and sure enough the kick pad stopped working after only 4 months of relatively light use.  I submitted an RMA request, and instead of just shipping me a new pedal, I had to go through the process of shipping the pedal out (at my expense) and waiting for it to be repaired, which will delay my recording for who knows how long (I am using it as a midi interface for Superior Drummer).  Despite my pleading with Behringer's outsourced customer service company to work with me, shipping the pedal back for repair was the only option they offered.  To the employee's credit, he offered to "expedite" the processing, whatever that means.  I have read many reviews where customers experience similar issues with the kick pad on this drum set.  I suppose this is my fault for not heading the advice of others and relying on a Behringer product for something as crucial as recording.  You get what you pay for, and I don't plan on making that mistake again.                
I bought this unit in May 2016 and have used it a few times to record. It is now early August and the kick drum trigger doesn't work.
I haven't even finished paying the 4 pay plan and now I need to send it to Behringer for repair.                
set is defective out of the obx. Behringer is aware of the issues with snare and kick responsiveness. Behringer will not back product nor can you get parts. So done the rode if something breaks, buyer would be out of luck and have to scrap the whole kit.                  
Compared to my Mackie - best not to. But I bought this little guy to ride around in a Pelican case and travel to seminars to run background music, movie sound tracks, and the audio from Flash and PowerPoint. For that it's fine and the tiny size is a real plus. Not much noise, and the preamp is better than OK for PA and simple voice tracks.                
No accessories, though the dedicated external power supply is a pain. It's big and heavier than the mixer. Worse than that, Behringer scrimped and made it single voltage. Not a problem if you don't travel. If you do and an over-anxious "helper" plugs it straight into U.K. mains and fries the 120v power supply with a quick pffffft, you'll lament the absence of dual-voltage when they were 'conceiving and designing' this thing in Germany for a Chinese factory to churn out. Lots o' luck getting parts - or a response - from Behringer. For the price, consider this item expendable.                
For my purpose it's plenty. Everything is straight forward and clear. Even the manual is OK. There's actually lots of flexibility for such an inexpensive product.                 
See above for "on the road" - single-voltage power supply. Mine has a slot in a padded case with lots of other gear and gets on fine. You can't bash it around, but one held up for 3 years just fine. The mechanics are surprisingly good. As to the quality of the electronics, I'll know when something breaks. So far so good.                
It's good value.                
Have one lying around with a fried power supply. Multiple emails to "service centers" listed on the Behringer website have gone unanswered, as has a query to the company, itself. A year ago I asked about dual-voltage or 240v power supplies and got no response. I'm giving them a 2 because they didn't have the opportunity to be obnoxious.                
Does pretty much what it pretends to do. No glitz or glamor, but functional enough.                
Size and weight are important in this portable application. I've replaced one already. The power problem is the big annoyance.                
Bought this for my small home studio.  I run Behringer electric drums and guitar through it.  I also run my phone and or laptop for playing music.  I was connecting my phone directly to my  Behringer B110D powered speaker and Behringer vq1500d powered sub with a stereo to mono 3.5 to XLR cable.   Before the mixer the sound was OK, but I had a lot of clipping and had to turn the speaker and sub's volume up to almost max in order to get the music loud.  After hooking up the 502 mixer, I have my speaker and sub volume under half, no clipping and the sound is clear, loud and just powerful!!!  At first I was not happy with the sound I was getting, get the mixer.  It made all the difference.  My drums are twice as loud with no clipping.                
I operate two full time internet radio stations. www.479xx.com and BoilerRadio.com and always need new equipment.I have always loved the board......the 502. .big tasks in a small package...for not a whole lot of money. and the service was awesome.......just what they said.....and quicker than they said it would arrive.                
This product works exactly how i want it too and its perfect for the job. the only problem that i have with it that pretty much only will affect some people, is the power cord. its very bulky and space taking but thats because i have it in a briefcase for easier transportation. if you have it set anywhere with space then that shouldn't be a problem. overall great product for running simple sound                
I needed a small mixer to add my keyboards together to one amp. This is perfect for my needs, with everything I want in a small package.In addition, it is stereo with panning for the inputs. This will allow me two outputs to add a bass amp and each channel can be adjusted to give a balance to each amp. Hope to try this soon. Lee                
HA! I just got this today..can't remember having this much fun and improving my set up for only 45 bucks...                
Very compact and light..no accessories included.                
Don't count on the owners manual to figure it out; it's poorly written. No helpful diagrams, nothing..Oh and a bit of a surprise, no on/off switch, have to manually unplug it..                
It does feel solid. Nice to plug in with the pre-amp, the mic, effects, guitar, drum machine and control it all though the mixer. Great tone though the headphones..                
Bargain really..                
Ummmmm..checked the website for helpful hints on how to hook up everthing; what is the function of the "main" ect. And nothing..                
Looks like the real deal only smaller. If I order one again I'd get the the 08 instead of the 05.                
At this point I'm very satsified with the sound quality and the functions.                
I cannot call myself an audio engineer with my 16 years,but still i HAVE used some of the best consoles avalible : I've worked with Fairlight consoles,the SSL's and many more classic consoles.Though i was always taught to FLEE from Behringer,when the time came for me to assemble my home studio,the pocket dictated.And so i bought this mixer and guess what-it's just as they said it would be!                
Though the product had NO acessories,it sounded good with the c414.When i was called to do some Recording for a metal band,i saw this mixer and laughed out loud,but than i almost changed my mind.
The preamp is not even close to what they say! In fact,it just cuts the cake and nothing more.You can use it until you buy a stand-alone and it will have a descent quality,but for a 50$ mixer,what do you expect?
The small number of channels is NEVER going to be used up on this mixer.Why?Only one amp.But still,the other channels DO have line-ins,so you can plug something else into them.
The peak-meter was broken when i came to use the mixer and all,but i don't doubt that the colors were pretty.But when it comes to the BEST features here,i gotta say i was impressed by the separate Headphones jacks.i really loved it-i could monitor what was being recorded in the booth while the artists were hearing the MIDI Mock-Up perfectly on the phones.
And there are the Tape and Mix options.Awesome.Though in a mixer this small,you don't need em.
So why would anyone be stupid enough to buy this mixer?Phantom Power.
Just plug-in a 80$ preamp in a Line-In,Plug the Mic in the Pre,and you're set.At a price of like 50 dollars,i guess it's worth buying.
Definitely getting one for MY studio.                
Yes it is easy,though the manual couldn't be more unclear.                
Behringer,bros!
Even if it's a 6000$ console - and behringer will NEVER make a console that pricy- the quality will suck.Why?made In China.Plastic.End of story.But may i remind you again....50 bucks!                
yes...because no1 sells this cheap mixers.                
uuuh behringer.That's all i gotta say.                
Well it has no sex appeal at all.The plastic looks awful.                
I think that it's a must for any newbie in recording,because it's almost a Starter Set in studios.                
There may be preamps that sound better than the ones in this mixer, but they cost hundreds, or thousands.                
Really good headphone amp, worth the price of the whole unit.                
Never dealt with Behringer.                
I had a bigger Behringer mixer and its power supply died; it shorted out after the plug got smashed in transit.  It was about the same price to buy this smaller unit (including a new power supply) as to buy the power supply alone, plus nobody had the PS in stock.  This is the third one of these mixers I've bought, and if one broke or I needed another, I'd definitely buy the same product again.                
Bought this one to replace the exact same model that had the headphone jack/Amp burn out. This one did the same thing in a matter of days. Not sure if I was doing something wrong. I was using it as a headphone amp, had a computer sound output (rear speaker) going into the "tape - in" jacks, and was using the stereo headphone out jack. Could smell it burning both times, both time burned out the same tiny surface mount resistor.                
I'm not using it as a mixer but only to control the audio volume from a DVD player toan embedded house built-in speaker system via a XLR wall socket connection tothe house amplifier, which I cnnot have access to once it is turned on............this device suits this purpose very well and its simplicity is a plus                
This gets the job done just fine. I use it just playing music from my computer. I use the Behringer UCA222 USB soundcard going into this mixer and my monitors going out of that. Very clean sound. 
I plan on eventually running my UBB1002 into the inputs on here for recording but have not tried that yet.                 
For what this has it has plenty. 
One of the main reasons I wanted to review this is, I read many reviews and none of them stated this has NO POWER SWITCH. I found that odd as I have never seen a mixer with out one and I find it inconvenient. I can look past that and just pull the plug each time I am done with it I guess.                 
It will last while it sits in place on my desk but I wouldn't want to do any traveling with this.                 
Love it so portable yet advanced Got it with the podcast USB kit but it does all my work perfectly. Come ON BEHRINGER!                
Cables,Mic.,U-CONTROL Interface                
Easy a Dog could use it, i had no experience and now one of a few who got 35th on NME Ameuteur Remix Charts Of Australia                
Made well (Dont Throw or blow up)                
Good value for the  price.                
needed a repair after a flight on virgin. But i didnt pack it well                
Sexy Portable Design feutures got a girlfriend from it thanks behringer                
Help with your goals but if you are serious look for its older brother 1002                
The sound quality after whatever I play is hooked to it sounds awesome.                
I like that you can even hook up CD Player/MP3 Players to it via RCA. That's a HUGE plus.                
Very easy to setup & there are so many different ways to get sound into.                
Extremely sturdy & durable. You would think it cost more from it's solid construction.                
Most certainly worth the money I wouldn't mind paying more for it.                
Haven't had to deal with support thus far.                
It looks very professional. I must be honest I feel in love with the look at first..                
I absolutely love this mixer! This is my first mixer ever but it has everything I need plus more. The Best part I would say is it's compact design. Fits nearly anywhere possible. I officially rep #TeamBehringer from here on out...                
The audio (going through the mixer and my Focusrite 2i4 interface sounds clean with little to no reduction in audio quality. I can still hear smaller details.                
Doesn't have too many features, or too little. The EQ is nice to have, although I don't need it. I leave it flat.                
Very simple to use. For a newbie, it might look like a lot, but once you figure out what does what, it's very simple. This is the same with most mixers, though.                
The mixer is built very well, although it wobbles on my desk as if one corner isn't touching the table. It's not much of an annoyance, but I thought I would mention that.                
This mixer is definitely worth the price, especially if you only need to hook up a few instruments in your home studio.                
n/a                
I am using this for a few instruments (A Yamaha MM8 piano and a Moog Little Phatty.)                
Excellent little mixer. Exactly what I needed for my PC DAW. The mic pres are very good. They're clean with lots of gain. I had my Great River patched in at first but after some experimenting I found I didn't need it. I was surprised at the comparisons. The on board pres come very close.                
Great features for the price. Especially the monitoring system. Very convenient. Behringer should've installed an on/off switch but no big deal. I just plugged it into my Furman power conditioner. Problem solved.                
Just plug in and start recording.                
It's built very well and so far has been very reliable. Knobs are tight and the housing is very sturdy.                
Without question. Big bang for the bux!!I'd really like to check out some of Behringers other mixers after hearing this little guy.                 
Never needed them but I've heard they are great.                
As long as it lasts. I would buy another in a NY minute if something happened to this one.                 
Great mixer. It helps to boost the sound quality and also provides additional input/output to hook extra mic or equipment. Thanks to zzounds for making my purchase affordable and possible.                
Very quiet, no hum.  Smooth operation, sq works well, sounds great!  I got this to go 
with two Mackie MR5 powered reference monitors I snagged for $99 each.  For less than $250 I have a 110 watt sound system.                
Blue power-on led is outrageously bright.                
Easy setup, just plug n play.                
Metal case, quality design.  No issues-perfect out of the box!
Great value for a handy little mixer!                
Unknown.                
Hey, it works.                
I use it for live gigs - I run my acoustic guitar microphone, pre-amp, effects and synths through it - works great, very ow noise and plenty of headroom. Only wish it has sweep EQ on the mic channels but, for the price may be too much to expect.                
I initially got it to have something in the home to allow multiple hook ups when streaming live sets to the Internet. I was impressed with the ability to set it up and within minutes of opening the box, I was good to go. The only thing I do not like is that  it does not have a power button.                 
The sound quality is very good for that price.                
There's a lot of features such as effects send/return, phones preview and phantom power.                
Plug in the power supply, plug in your inputs and you're good to go.                
It's very well built and the knobs are durable.                
This mixer is amazing for its price!                
Didn't use it.                
The unit is extremely compact and it's very well designed.                
This is a great mixer at a very low price.
Pros:
- Phantom power
- CD/Tape Input
Cons:
- No On/Off button                
for a beginer its a great option, no doubt. i stared to record with this mixer, but if u can buy a mixer from anothe brand do it. couse its good, but not great. you get what you pay                
it has some good features, i like the EQ and the phantom power, whit all the features this mixer its a very good option if you want to have a litle more control of your recordings                  
Like any other mixer, no complains here                
its a solid machine, honestly. i got to reconize that. very good finish quality, never fail to me.                
like i said, its cheap, and has some good features and good finish quality for the price, just dont expect a studio quality results with it                
never need it                
sex appeal?? looks like a regular mixer, not bad, but nothing that shocked me                
i will recomend it ONLY if you are beginner, its a cheap option, and a good one considering the price but you will not hear anything close to studio quality. if you have the money and you are serious whit the music, buy a mackie or something better                
The sound is not clean. I use it for a practice area. There is very little headroom and the preamps are very noisy. I've tried it side by side with my Mackie 1202 and difference is easily discernible. The Mackie is quiet and has a wide range before you hear noise; not so with the Behringer.                
not much static when i record...                
with wut there is... features work great                
new to using mixers and i started recording in 5 minutes....                
looks great and works great                
definitely worth the money                
shipped rite away                
glad i bought it.. looks great                
ill prolly use this for a long time                
This is truly showing to be a very big bang for the buck. 550 watts, about 30lbs,has EQ, small and with handles.A real winner for me. It really does sound good and with lots of punch and volume to spare. $271.99, I could not find anything to beat this near its price.I had it for about 4 weeks. It was packaged excellent. Mounts on my speaker stand with ease. I play guitar through it,Keyboard, Bass guitar, CD player and use mics. I am very pleased with this product.                
has EQ LOW,HI                
Simple , loud,  sounds very good                
it is very solid                 
Biggest Bang for the Buck                
low profile and well designed                 
I want another one of these and then some subs                 
Clean...makes my MIDI files sound more better, i use midi files for my live performance...& i hooked up my keyboards with it & they both sounded good together.                
nice features...3 band EQ...high headroom pre-amps..just what im looking for                
as easy as 1-2-3, or a-b-c...i wonder if anybody can go wrong with it.                
metal chasis...plastic maybe sturdy too...let's see if this thing falls...hope not...                
well,,, worth every penny... just what im looking for...                
havnt used it,,maybe no comment for now..but the store i bought it was quite understanding..coz the adaptor that comes with the package is broken so i went back & they replaced it right away,,but ofcourse they tested it first...sucks...anyway i hope next time no more defective adaptors Behringer..ok?                
i have few other compact mixers before but this stand out...maybe i would buy a mackie in the near future but for now im hooked with this...i tried Peavey, Phonic, Yamaha & other compact mixers, but this is much better...                
well maybe if i would go on a more bigger venue that's time i would improve my gears,,but for now earning a few bucks a night,,what can i ask for..cheap on the price but not cheap on the musicality...                
The mixer is simple to use. I am only giving 7/10, however, for two reasons: (1) there is no on/off switch, so you have to unplug it to turn it off, and (2) it has a piercingly bright LED that indicates the power is on but is so brilliant that it makes it difficult to see the controls on a darkened stage. I covered the LED with black electrical tape because it was so annoying.                
The AC adapter plug is badly designed. It is difficult to connect because there are 3 small prongs on the end of the wire (like a PS/2 mouse/keyboard plug on an older PC) that connect to a female jack on the unit. The wire only fits in a single orientation, and it is difficult to tell what the correct orientation is. In the second month after purchase (shortly after the store's 30-day return period, of course) the female jack in the unit started pushing inwards and tilting, and the cord became even harder to connect. After half a year one of the prongs on the cord broke off, making it impossible to power the unit.
Note that the unit did not get heavy use--I only used it about 10 times before the prong broke off, and I am gentle with my gear. It probably would be fine if you plugged it in once in a studio and left it there, but it is not gig-worthy by any means.
The AC adapter interface should be like all the other AC adapters you have laying around the house: a wire that has a male plug with a hole in it, and a unit that has a female jack with a single prong in the center.                
The price is low, and the quality is commensurate. You get what you pay for. I will replace mine with a better quality product from another manufacturer.
To get this unit repaired under warranty, I would have to repackage and mail it to Behringer at my expense. Hardly worth the hassle given the initial cost.                
I needed a small mixer for gigs with multiple keyboards, and I wanted one that had the option to send separate outputs to my own monitor and to the main PA. This mixer does that, but the quality is too low for serious use outside the home.                
i was surprised that this actually made my mc-505 sound better. warmer. less digital.
and running my guitar through it, distorted or clean, sounds almost as good as my amps clean channel.                
pretty good features. most my gear already has eq on it, so the lack of freq. on the eq isnt that big of a promblem. im sure when i purchase some microphones, ill be wishing there was more flexability.                
i dont see how anyone could have a problem haha. very straight forward.
plug something in, turn the volume up, plug something out.                
only had it 2 weeks
seems very solid. knobs are very smooth, not loose at all. if i had a carrying case to protect the knobs i would have no problem traveling it.                
definitly worth the money                
no clue. no problems                
looks pretty good.. the plastic sides are a little lame                
i bought it so i could listen to my 505, my guitar, and my electric drums at the same time.(of course i cant play drums and guitar at the same time, i ment to jam with a buddy.)
what i actually got wwas that, and it warmed up both the drums and the 505. very nice                
The mic-pres are good and provide a clean sound.  I use them mainly for vocals.  The noise is pretty quite.  I'm sure acoustic guitars would sound great through this mixer.                
Just what I needed for vocal recording.  Happy about the main mix outs, phone out, and control room out.  It always me to monitor the sound perfectly with my small set-up.  I would pay a lil more money for a sweepable mids freq on the eq.  I would pay even more ($40 -- is it feasible?) for two sweepable mids.  It would allow my computer to rest a bit more, and it's hard to get a decent and dedicated mic-pre at that cost.  Oh, yeah, thanks for the RCA in/outs.  I would pay a more, also, for an optical digital out or USB.  (But I don't want a huge mixer.)                
I am self-taught, so I use it for mainly what I need: recording vocals.  I read the manual to figure out how to use the sends.  I had read plenty on it, but never had a piece of equipment to try it on.                
It appears to be built decently.  I enjoy the metal face, and don't mind the plastic side pieces.  The knobs ARE NOT loose at all.  If it lasts me 2-3 years, I would be more than appreciative.  I'm just wondering how long the mic-pres will last.  That's most important to me.  The earlier Behringer mixers have received pretty good ratings, so I suspect these new Xenyx's will soon get the same.                
It's definitely worth its price, especially if you're short on moolah.  Of course, there are other mixers that I would love to have.......but I'm not paying $500-$1000 for them.  At this price, I have learned some things (like digital outs/USB) have to done away with.                
Haven't had to use them.  My first time buying a Behringer product.  I am aware that music equipment companies don't provide the best customer service, so I'm glad that I received a mixer in working order.  Please, God, let them answer my e-mail/phone call the day I need them.  Pleeeeeeassse!!!                
It's a practical addition to my set-up.  If Behringer adds two sweepable mids and an optical digital out to this mixer, then I would lust for it.  But "lust" could still only command a fair price.  I'm no fool.                
I'll use this for some time.  The price and purpose go hand-in-hand.  Since I am self taught, and only record vocals at this time, I would look for another product if I started recording bands......or if I needed more fx returns.  Or if sweepable mids became a necessity to give my processor a break.  I'd rather destroy my mixer than my Apple.                
Never had a mixer before this is my first but it sounds great                 
The best for the price if you want to play some british 70s 60s rock                
Never had a mixer before took me very little time to set it up                
Everythings rock soli                
Worth spending the money                
havnt needed any                
looks better then any mixer ive seen                
So many options with this solid mixer... a true workhorse. One of the few small/table top mixers with smooth accurate faders, quality preamps and plenty of mic/line/stereo options. Why people overlook this mixer is beyond me! We also have an older model;this new 1002B is even better. These things are built like tanks. Runs on batteries, if needed. Unity gain is true on all channels,including master mix channel. Great for a small band, a drum mixer, keyboard mixer,etc. We also use it for a DJ mixer, alongside a laptop and a USB 2-2 Mackie ONYX interface. Love it for band reheasals!                
I am SO glad I found this on your site. As a composer/performer who performs with and without backup and numerous locations (some without a house system and even some remote spots without power), having this and other equipment that offer both AC and battery powered usage is invaluable. What's more is the fact that this unit allows awesome sound via its well enamored preamps and Phantom power (even when battery powered). All tolled... one could mic-up several vocalists and acoustic instruments and run them through a couple battery-operated amps and flood a moderate crowd using no AC power at all! Before this purchase, I was stuck, solely, with the few inputs the amps allowed (in my case, a total of 4 - 2 each). Behringer has earned my dedication over the years... not because they're inexpensive compared to others, but their quality exceeds the others!                
Great little mixer. Sounds good and very versatile. I needed more line inputs than mic inputs. Using it for recording.                
Sound is great. I use it on the gig and recording. No complaints.                
This mixer is well laid out. The only  thing lacking is the missing power switch, but it's a very minor issue.                
No problems.                
Great quality. Well-built.                
Are you kidding? I don't know how they do it, but I hope they keep on doing it! Well worth the price. I also purchased their XM8500 mic for using live, which is rugged and sounds clear - awesome value. Behringer rocks!                
Have not had to contact customer support.                
I checked around a long time before I settled on this mixer. I wanted the smallest mixer available with effects. Some musicians I work with have Behringer mixers and they love them.                
I would buy another in a heartbeat. In fact, I may get a second one for back-up when I have some extra cash.                
It has low noise, even with the gain cranked up on the microphone channels (with 60+dB of gain, that's really saying something!) I've made several good recordings with it - everything ran through it sounds good live and in recording: vocals through a condensor mic, acoustic guitars through a condensor mic, five-string bass through a direct box and electric guitar through an RP500. The tracks that I've made with it mix together well on my archlinux-based DAW (so very little distortion as well).
This mixer is clear and transparent. With tone controls at zero and "fx" levels at zero, it does not color the mix as far as I can tell.
Turning the treble (on the mic channels) all the way up can add significant noise however - you can't forget how to mix when using this thing (cut rather than boost if at all possible).
The pan pots are center-detent types. However, none of the pots exactly "center" the sound when the pot is in the center. (That's a common problem with center-detent pots). Using a meter or computer, you'll have to micro adjust the pans to ensure exact centering.
The effects are surprisingly good considering the price of this mixer. The reverbs are realistic, clear and usable, especially for vocals. I was only looking for a mixer, but the 1002FX was not much more expensive than the 1002 (same mixer, but without the effects) - I figured, "why not? - I can always zero it out if I don't like it."
For the price, I'm giving this an eight, only because of the cranked treble control adding more noise than I expected to discover.                 
Power supply included - it gets warm when in use.
There are center-detent pots on the tone controls, pan controls and the "fx" controls, making it easy to locate "middle" or "zero" (or almost, as noted above). 
I don't use the tone controls on the mic channels (I set them at 0). I use my DAW for equalization.
The mic channels and main have clipping indicators - very useful, especially since it is rarely obvious from the sound when subtle clipping is happening.
The blue power indicator LED is blindingly bright. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but something to know. It can be easy to see from a distance that the unit is on.
The phantom power works as expected - has a slow turn on and turn off time, as is common.
The effects - I like the reverbs. I've used the chorus and flanging effects on a bass for some interesting results.
No on-off switch. I hate that, but I knew that when I bought it. I would have gladly paid an extra $3 for a switch - that's about what an acceptable rocker switch would have cost retail. In fact, Behringer could have left out the tone controls (which I don't use anyway) and used the extra budget to include a power switch.
The mixer does not come with 1/4" male to RCA female adapters, so you'll need some if you want to plug in RCA equipment to channels 3-10.                
Easy to use, especially if you've ever used a mixer before. The only thing that might be different is the effects module - turn the dial to the effect program you want, push the dial down, adjust your "fx" levels and you have effects.
I read a PDF version of the instruction manual before I bought it, as I try to do with everything I buy. The mixer comes boxed with the same in-print manual (one English, one German and one written in eight different languages).                
It is compact. Nothing rattles when shaken. The paint and lettering seem well attached and are without flaw. It is encased in durable plastic and barring having a speaker cab dropped on it or something (which would likely damage the pots rather than the plastic housing), I expect that it will last for years. 
Since the power supply and unit get warm when in use, I am concerned that those may overheat and self destruct. Therefore, I don't leave it running 24/7 - for example, I don't run my home entertainment signals through it. I do, however, run it for up to twelve hours at a time when doing recording sessions without any obvious thermal problems.                
Compared to other mixers around the same price as the 1002FX, I'm satisfied with the value. It is worth the asking price. It would be difficult to design and build my own mixer with comparable quality for the price...I'm an electrical engineer, so I'm capable of that (just don't have the time, despite being hopelessly unemployed).                
Didn't contact Behringer - did not need to.                
I wouldn't call it sex appeal, but this mixer is laid out well. The lettering is easy to read. The knobs on the pots are color coded (white for level, black for pan, red for fx, blue for tone).                 
I like this mixer and expect to be using it for twenty years or so (like the RadioShack mixer this is replacing). It suits my simple "low noise, low distortion, one or two tracks  at a time with phantom power" recording needs perfectly. The effects were extra, but I've made good use of them. If it were lost or stolen, I would not hesitate to buy another 1002FX.                
Although is a good choice for entry level and home studio, there is a background noise which can not be eliminated whatsoever. The price is great as you can start at $38 for the 502, but you must be aware that this piece makes noise, not so loud but noise anyway.                 
I woould give an 8 in features as it includes all the ones you need for your home studio. You can connect a microphone, your guitar pedal effects, a CD player, your mobile, a recorder, etc.                 
Nothing to read if you want to start right away. Very easy to use.                 
The presentation of the product is very nice, looks quite robust, quite modern. I have given 5 as the noise is the main concern here.                 
This is perhaps the best point here with Behringer as my 502 mixer was just $38.                 
I have never had to use product support, so I can not rate it.                 
The general product looks great and very well designed.                 
This is a product that you will choose for the price; however, after 4 or 6 months you will start thinking to look for something with better quality as the noise will be there...                
I purchased this little mixer to use with the Mackie SRM150 PA as it has some nice effects.  It works very nice.                
It seems quiet and the effects are a nice touch.  You can download the effects page at the Behringer site.                
I ran sound test From 20Hz to 20Khz....from low to high thu the mic EQ's and up to internal clip...Witch takes a bit of trying...And the sound is great....I am very opinionated on my sound...Nothing but great sound to my ears...                
I gave this a 7 on the features, Not because its lacking...I got this model, tho if you want more features the 1202FX would be the 10 in this size mixer...                
not too small that you need 4 year old fingers to use it...but not so big that its not a great portable Mixer...Not overly heavy like it has lead in it...but still feels nice and sturdy...                
hey i feel i got more then what i payed for...in the good way...not that i think it should cost more but for something like this... worth every penny and the everyday Joe can get a brand new one w/ out selling everything they own to have something, That will do everything they ask of it and take a beating....                
Again I feel i got everything i ask for and more...                
yet to need it....The best type of support is when everything you need to know is eather just that simple or well documanted when you first open the box"...10 points..."                
LOL i want it because I already have it...LOL sorry just had to say that....Corny i know...                
I gave it a overall * not becouse its missing anything...Because its very down to earth...Plan...If you need more step-up a few models...But I am in NO...I repeat.."NO!" way complaning about something that feels this good you use and work w/...and still is not going to break the bank or skimp on sound quality..                 
Sound is Clear,  No distortion or unwanted Hums or Buzz. Our Acoustical Group plays a lot of Small to Medium size Churches.  Most have a P.A. but they tend have 2 - 4 Inputs / Mic's. Our group requires 5 - 8 Mic's.
By having this very small and portable Mixer, and piggy backing it to the House P.A. We can add 4 more Mic inputs in a matter of minutes.
Oh yea bring Extra Mic's and cables.                
So far the Pots, Jacks and slides seem to be Ok.                 
Pretty Simple to use. Hardest thing to do is to plug in the power supply.
It's a German Din type Plug. Looks a lot like the PS2 plug from your old PC keyboard.  Before the Advent of USB. Meaning  don't bend or force those little tiny Pins.  You may find the replacement power supply is $75 dollars. It has very odd Voltages  and you will never find a "Generic" replacement for it. Of course it will run 3 hours on three 9 volt batteries.  But you will have "Low" voltage for Phantom Power.                
Fit and Finish are good.                
At about 100 bucks, It is priced slightly below comparable Yamaha products.  However Yamaha is Known and Proven High Quailty Manufacturer.                
Don't know,  Never had to contact Behringer.  But they have a good Web site for Operator manuals and Product Specs.                
Small, Light and lots of Inputs and Outputs.                
Another 3 - 5 years.                
Very versatile mixer for the price point . Easilly accessible, clear concise, labeling. Great for a small combo. Would definitely recommend purchase.                
The sound is of really high quality i actually prefer this mixer to my Mbox 2 the mbox has too much noise these preamps are amazing                
it has plenty of features more then any other mixer ive seen i mean come on? On Board Effects on a mixer? b4 i would say YEAH RIGHT but Behringer pulled it off and made it affordable.                
I only gave it a 9 because tho its easy to use you have to travel thru alot of effects to get the one you want i mean it has 100 effects.                
The product is excellently made if i didnt buy this i would think it cost like 300.00                 
you have a lot of bang for tha buck with this one! just look at all the features and the PREAMPS...lets just say they could compare to Focusrite!                
i havent had to call them so i havent needed support so i cant really rate them on that.                
it looks good it sounds good and it feels good                
Im lovin it!                
Very quiet mixer.  I honestly just wanted a small utility mixer but I am surprised at the quality and will use it on actual recordings.  The reverb is very detailed sounding, not tubby or digital.  It is not capable of customized settings.  This quality of effects in a stand alone processor would have cost hundreds of dollars just a few years ago.  The reverbs are better than the flangers and phasers, effects that I don't really use much.                  
A lot of features for the money.  It has four mic preamp channels with three band EQ, effects and panning.  Then 4 stripped-down stereo channels with panning, effects, and level.  There is also an effects send and return, tape in and out, and master outs.  Perfect for a smaller project studio, a keyboardist, a songwriter with a few instruments, etc.                  
Easiest mixer I have ever owned and used.  You can just look at it and you can see where everything is being routed.  You will have to look at a separate sheet of paper to see the effects listing because it is a two-digit display.                
It has plastic sides but it feels very sturdy and has some heft to it.  The knobs feel very good, especially for a hundred bucks.  The design is handsome and well-engineered.  Reminds me of my old Mackie 1202.
I am very pleased with this purchase.  Probably the best $100 I have spent in musical equipment.  For that price you can get an effects pedal, a small practice amp, or THIS - A quality-built 12 channel mixer with impressive effects.                
I have not used support.                
It packs a bunch of features in a small space.  I do enjoy looking at it and feel that it is an improvement over the euro models in both color and design.                
I purchased a Mackie 1642 for hundreds of dollars more and it stopped working within a couple of years.  At this price I will not be so bummed when that day comes, perhaps it won't.  The Behringer track record seems uneven to me.  My compressor works fine and it is pretty old.  Some folks are not as lucky I've heard.                
Nice for the bucks, a fully loaded small mixer for the price of a stomp box. plenty of features, lots of in & outs. Clean transparent sound. Mic preamps cover a wide range for high to low output mics. Phantom power a big plus. For someone familiar with mixers it's pretty straight forward and easy to operate. Seems rugged/durable. Never have had an issue. The effects are great, nice sounds and lots of 'em.
I use this mixer for home based recording with another unit for a 4 bus out. Computer is set up with a sound card that allows 4X4 full duplex recording. I can see this board being used for small club venue. Has four mic inputs, plenty of outs for room speakers, stage monitors and recording simultaneously, or as a practice/rehearsal mixer. For the price you can't go wrong. It works good with all types of mics, eletric, condenser, dynamics, ribbons. Again the sound is clean and transparent, very professional. It is small so my two fit easily on my computer desk. i use mine daily, it's one of those things that helps feed my music addiction. I have only two minor complaints about this unit; 1. it has no on-off switch. 2. the headphone output is wimpy. Wussy headphone output is common to almost all small mixers this size. Half a dozen or so manufacturers use the same electronics/design in these boards. Electronics has grown over the past decades, A mixer of this quality would have cost thousands not so far back. This is one of the most useful tools in my arsenal of music stuff.  Easy to use so it's great for  beginners. Something I really have fun with.                
i play guitar and sing backups,and a few whole songs in a rock band, and this thing is gonna help my voice sound much better than going dry like i have been,i need anything to help my voice...lol...and this does the job!!!                
no power switch                
very easy this was my 1st time setting up a mixer and it was very easy!!!                
its plastic,but its a mixer not a stomp box                
awesome value!!! i would pay double the price for this mixer!!!                
i had a problem in the past with behringer with a guitar amp i bought,it took a while but they gave me a sweet upgrade...hopefully i wont have any problems with this mixer,seems like it will be fine though,ill give manufacturer support a 9 on my past experiance with behringer                 
100 effects to chose from and having the fx level on each channel and the main fx for the board is great!!!also the mic preamps are a good plus!!!                
good little mixer!!!easy to set up,sounds great!!! i give this thing a 9 on features because it has no on-off switch,i just went and bought a small power strip so i dont have to keep plugging and unplugging the power since the input to the board is kinda flimsy,the sound is nice and clear,to set a effect channel you want dont forget to push down on the fx selection button to set a effect or your just gonna be in the test mode lol like i did for a whole practice..lol..duh..(if the number on display is blinking your not set) for a $110.00 you cant go wrong with this baby!!! even in test mode i was happy...lol...but now i know how to set effects wow the sounds are great!!! i would pay double for this mixer,and oh yeah itll be great for our small venue playouts very easy to set up and small...                
So far, I have been blown away by these preamps. I have a mackie 1604vlz that I use in the studio, and wanted something portable so I wouldn't have to undo everything when we played a gig that required our own stuff.
I started testing this last week so I could get a feel for it before our next show. We were playing along when I noticed something...silence.
There was no hiss. Just clean warm sound. So far so good!                
Built in effects are cool...not listing the effects...not cool.
I get get that you can't give full control over every effect in such a small package...so you have 99 presets and something should take. Honestly, the reverb sounds pretty good. However, there is nothing in the manual about the effects...only something writtin on the board itself saying something to the effect of 1-16 reverb, 17-29 mod...etc
I would rather not play with 99 presets to find the sound I am looking for, I still have no idea if one of the effects is compression.
So the features seem nice...the instructions and usablility of them...so far, not so good.                
see above.
The mixer itself is really straight forward, the effects section, much less so.                
I won't know until I use it for a while, but it has a nice weight to it, and 'feels' well made.                
So far, its a great value!                
no idea...hopefully I won't find out either :)                
Its a mixing board...I guess its nice looking, but...its a mixing board.                
I would get another...great sound, small, and convenient.
Besides, once I finally figure out all 99 presets, I will be damned if I am NOT going to have it :)                
I use this mixer to sub-mix my keys, vocals (both dry and post Voicelive Touch), as well as my guitar and a monitor mix.  This provides a perfect 'more me' setup for my IEMs (output of mixer feeds a limiter box and then to my in-ears).  One of the biggest complaints for this mixer has been that the blue power LED used to be so bright on stage, it would blind you and you would have to cover it with tape.  Not any more, great news is that Behringer replaced it with a normal brightness orange LED.  The only other issue for me is aligning the power cord plug into the mixer body correctly on a dark stage without bending or breaking the pins in the cord plug.  I had to apply white electrical tape to the cord plug and make a 'sharpie' mark to indicate proper plug orientation.  Great mixer at a great price.                
Budget price budget sound!                
The FX is great,  The 100 FX are listed in an appendix to the manual which can be downloaded.                
Very intuative.                
No problems at this early stage.                
Nothing matches the bang for buck.                
Very helpful phone support before and after purchase.                
Looks and feels great!                
This will suit my limited needs for quite a while.  Where have i heard that before :-)                
This model is about to be discontinued for the USB one that will cost more.  So grab one while they last.  I needed extra mic and inputs for my Bose L1 Compact.  I now have studio quality effects on all channels.  You can find a sheet of the effects to print out  if you do some searching on line.                 
Purchaced this in 2010. Previously I was using a USA made Mackie 1202.
The Mackie lacked effects, it's only shortcoming.
The Behringer XENYX 1202FX Mixer is an amazing piece of gear.
My advice pertaining to Behringer gear in general is to HANDLE WITH CARE. 
The stuff is fragile. This one has been transported in a hard breifcase with enough room for all the hook ups and more.
This unit was produced in 2009 and is going on 6 years of regular use and running strong. I have set this baby up over 850+ times (one to four hrs).
I stopped using a bigger Behringer mixer in my band gigs because this one was always in my trunk and it worked for my single act and small band venues
So, it's all about protecting the sliders,knobs and that tricky power supply jack.
It even took a line in from another mixer,no problem.
If you can live in a 1/4 inch world check this out!!!
Can't beat it for the money, it's my second one, the first one was Non Fx. It handled so much just wonderfully! But the euro rack is better organized wire wise and worth the extra money. I will eventually upgrade to that one...it will be part of a rack box set up. I had trouble registering  product, but so cheap who cares, they want receipt uploaded...like it's really necessary. Power display  is meant to stay on, not broken.                
This mixer is the only one I've seen in it's class. Anything else at 100 bucks is a line mixer or something. This is actually gigworthy for a small band. Particularly if you have powered speakers! Then, your load in is easy, set up is easy, use is easy, tear down and leaving is easy. Sure beats the days of a rack of gear to do the same amount of work. It needs a power switch. But, the weaker point in the design is the input for power. It has very fragile pins and they are not marked well. If you don't line them up right, you will easily destroy the plug. I don't know why they couldn't use the same 'computer' plug everybody else has. I used white paint to mark teh arrow that shows the right way to insert the plug. At a gig, it can be dark...Anyway, that pretty blue light is too darned bright and can keep you from seeing the controls in a darker setting. Behringer has this light on many of their products and it is annoying. Over all, the mixer is very good. Fix those things and it would be excellent. I really don't have any experience with their support service, but it doesn't seem right to down grade them for having great stuff that doesn't breakdown.                
Solo acoustic sometimes duo.. perfect for an easy set up. Dial in your favorite reverb, set it & go. Light equipment. I am very careful with it since it could be delicate. Don't want to take the chances of finding out.                
Just plugged in this mixer and put it through its paces. The sound quality is really good. I have it hooked up to a Tapco 1400 power amp, so I've got plenty of headroom. (overkill?) My Takamine acoustic sounds full & rich, and vocals are clear & strong.Two criticisms: 1. The power cord uses a funky, small computer typ multi-pin connector that was a pain to get lined up & plugged in. Bad design decision.2. My unit contains built in effects with 99 pre-sets, but the unit comes with a manual and a catalog, and the listing of the effects is nowhere to be found. Will have to go online & hunt them down. Other than that, I'm very happy with the mixer.  *Have no experience with Behringer customer support, but they made me rate them!                
I now have two and use them with stand alone high power PA amps. They sound great. I have a bunch of Behringer gear and have never been let down.                 
This is a very good piece of equipment that should handle most of your needs for small and larger venues.  The build in FX processor really adds a great touch.  Don't know where your going to find another piece of equipment that does everything this will at this price.  The only improvement I would make would be to add sliders instead of knobs.                
Works perfect with my Bag Amp to put some effects on the vocals. Sounds great for little money.                
Mic pre-amps are silent. Effects work as advertised.  Sounds good for a tiny little mixer.  I was honestly surprised that the Behringer product sounded this good.                
It is simplistic, but extremely functional. The channel controls are not as fine-grained as a full-sized mixer but I didn't expect them to be. The phantom power is an 'all or nothing' deal for all XLR inputs, but that's fine with me. The built in effects are a real bonus. You need the included cheat sheet to know which effects you're dialing up, but I rarely change the setting, so it works for our band. There is no on/off power button that I can find, so I've resorted to using the power button the amp to prevent clunks and chunks. If it's plugged in...it's on.                
Really easy to use if you understand anything at all about sound. It's pretty intuitive and it does what it's supposed to. It's easy enough that I can adjust the mix in the middle of a rehearsal without putting down my bass.                
Seems solid. I've only been using it for a month, but no issues so far.                
Extremely high! For far less than $100, I have a small sized 12-channel mixer with the essential features that I need. I combined it with a 200W rack-mount amp and can run a monitor mix at rehearsals without breaking out the full-blown sound system.                
Haven't used.                
It's a mixer. It has lots of knobs and plugs and it has a pretty blue light and an LED number display and some of the LEDs blink on an off with signal. It's entertaining to small children. Seriously...the small size, plus included features are what sold me on the Xenyx 1202FX mixer.                
I bought this mixer as a 'rehearsal' mixer for our band. We run 4 vocal mics, rhythm guitar, and keyboard through it. There are plenty of inputs to run bass and lead guitar as well, we've just chosen not to.                
I am the owner of a number of Behringer products and most have been pretty good if not excellent in performance and price. I thought this would have been the same with the 1202 FX Mixer. When I received the unit yesterday I plugged it in and after 5 minuets the bottom panel gets very hot, There is no on/off switch so you have to unplug it to turn it on and off. It comes with a proprietary electrical cord and transformer giving very little forgiveness if you lose or misplace that somewhere. The design for ventilation on the unit is very poor, anything that runs that hot is not going to last very long. Called zZounds and they were very cordial but I did have to pay the shipping back and waste a lot of time going to Fed Ex and UPS and the shipping costs are 20% of the mixer. With all manufactures of musical instruments, never take anything for granted. Ask the retailer the dumbest questions and safe yourself some grief and time .If you cant test it out at the local music store or their are insufficient reviews on You Tube beware.                
Seems like a good little mixer EXCEPT I wasnt' aware that it was NOT powered . Make sure you have all supporting equipment before buying (POWER AMP)....then you'll be good to go. I'm rating it a 3 on sound simply because I was not aware that it could not be used as a direct plug in for shows and because it's not powered, it's quiet. Once properly connected to a powered source, I'm sure it will be fabulous.  SOLID make, GREAT quality of sound if using for studio work, and will be equally as great for shows once powered....(did I mention it's NOT powered?? LOL)                
Good quality sound. It respons very well. Im not sure yet how to utilize the special effecta since im only using it for karaoke.                
It does well for karaoke, i do not use it for a guitar.                
I really hate that it doe snot have a power switch. If i had known would have bought something different. I dont want the hassle of returning the item and waiting longer.                
No power switch. Dont understand the idea, or lack of.                
Yes, i would replace with something else.                
Behringer is a German base company. Fine engineering typical of the Germans. but made by a substandard Chinese manufacturer. The power jack is unlike anything I have ever seen. 3 tiny pins no longer than 3 millimeters and a Jack housing on the board that does not hold the jack plug securely. 4 times in the middle of recording the jack fell out on it's own. the very cheap Plastic Plug in chord has a life of it's own. Being barely pliable it is prone to reverting back to it's original wound state, which pulls the jack out of the board. the board itself is the cheapest plastic I think I've ever come across. I had to not only tape down the plugin jack but also tape down a barrier to keep the weight of my guitar cable from pulling it off the desk. this bottom has no rubber bumpers typical in most all electronic devices is made of the pre-molded body of the board and is very slick. I sent the first one back thinking it was just defective. The second board was no different and I sent it back too. Don't buy this board unless you are into the cheapest Chinese made product on the market.                
Praising what is good and what is not so good is MOOT. The power chord connection to the mixer is loose and sloppy and prone to loosing power if the power cable is even brushed by another cable. It is the worst power connection I've ever seen. 3 very tiny post that barely go deep enough for a  connection. I sent for a replacement and it was exactly the same. Behringer is from Germany and known for excellence in engineering and build. It is no longer made in Germany. Alas it is just another piece Chinese manufactured junk. If I were the head of Behringer I would be highly embarrassed to see the companies fine  products reduced to junk by the Chinese.                
I'm giving the sound 10 because there is no way even those "big" name mixers can approach this small baby! The mic preamps are simply sweet! It is even good to use it for recording...                
It has everything a small mixer needs. The effects are very good for live performance applications.                
No need to go to kindergarten to be able to use it!                
Strongly built! Although the older versions seem to be stronger, but it is perfectly good.                
I would pay double the price and still be very happy.                
Did not need them.                
Perfect high-quality compact mixer. Good for live and even recording. The preamps are sweet!                
Very good, clean sound with little noise. It's a great improvement from my old Behringer mixer.                
It has more than all other mixers in the price range, even some costing $100 more. The effects are clean and crisp, BUT, and this is why I'm giving it a 5, it doesn't have a ON/OFF switch! Come on Behringer, I'd pay $5 more for it! Need to unplug it every time I turn it off, which is pretty annoying.                
As easy as any other mixer                
Looks well built, very compact.                
Awesome value for my money                
Haven't tried to reach them                
I was a little worried about getting a set of mics for 40 buck, but once i received them i was impressed with the quality, and then I plugged them into my board at our church and WOW what a difference, everyone noticed how clear they sounded. I was so impressed i ordered another set. Highly recommend them.                
Our trio needed some mic fixing fast and CHEAP!!! I can't say enough about these mics. We thought we'd be tweaking for hours. Right away, we were pleasantly surprised. Within minutes, no "tweaky" feedback. I am using them in the studio and out in front at gigs and there great. Everybody knocks Behringher, people need to get a grip. 80% of our gig rig is and it's awesome stuff. People say we sound like the radio.                 
These mics are solid and well made. I have had em a few months to abuse and no beefs to report.                
Flexible for the most part....they were only $34 bucks. For this price I could not have made em doing for us what there doing????                
nicely made                
no                
it's a freakin mike....want sexy, go retro and blow a wadd                
For now, a nine as we have agreed to wear these out before we worry about some 58's.....think it's going to be a while?                
We bought these mics to replace cheap cordless mics that sounded horrible. These are much better but they will pick up any bump from the stage or mic stand. Have to use wind screens even at indoor events to cut back on the vocalist breath from being picked up by mic.                
The case and the mic holders are a plus.                
If you can hold it in front of your mouth you can use it. If your sound guy can plug it in to the right connection it works. Does not work when turned off (just picking on vocalist).                
Very durable                
We payed a little more than the price here would recommend them to anyone looking for mics on a budget. For live performance. But if you want to record spend the money to get better quality.                 
Hold it or put it on a stand (just kidding) have not needed any.                
The question here is sex appeal, but my daughter and a young man use these for ministry no sex appeal desired!                
We have already purchased better mics but keep these for back up. If we were not planning on recording these would have been fine for our needs. We lead worship for youth and small worship services and they work good giving a natural sound to the voice. My only complaint would be they have none or very little noise canceling properties and pick up a lot of excess noise in the area of the mics when left on.                
Found these mics to have very good sound quality. They have no prblem picking up multiple voice ranges. I'am using them in my home studio with a small PA system.                
Having 3 mics all the same makes it very easy to set EQ's and FX. Having a nice case aids in safe storage when not in use. All in all, I can't say anything negitive about these Behringer mics.                
Very easy to get good sound when mixing with other vocalists.                
These mics seem of good quality as do my other Behringer products, well made and if you need looks in a mic, these will fit the bill.                
Three vocal mics that sound this good,and are of Behringer quality, should last a long time in my application, and this price you can not beat!                
N/A                
Was making music without mics. Now we have fun hearing and recording with a little more volume and accent. Just adding to the enjoyment.                
I belive I'll get several years out of these mics and if that works out I'd buy them again. Oh' I'd buy them again even if their life span ends up shorter than mine.                
I got these mic's and was impressed with them. I don't know why, but everyone tries to compare mic's to SM-58's. These stand on their own. They've got a great sound. I recommend them to anyone looking for a good deal, on a budget. Good sound , low cost.                
great mic's and they are super cardiod, which is a plus in pro gear, and they are very sensitive does not take much volume on these to make them come through the mix,                  
I got these mic's for an upcoming play and needed some extra ones, so the price was right. Mic's sounded better then our more expensive ones. They sounded so go I am buying another set to replace our other mic's.
Like one reviewer noted the plug hookup is hard to make lock, but i think a different end on the cord might help on that. Or some good old electrical tape around the connection.                
I bought these mics because I wanted the case and clips for my 58s. I was actually surprised how good they sound. I said I was going to throw the mic away but I've actually used them. A couple times at my writers nights with great review on them. I covered the name up on the mics with electrical tape. Everyone assumed they were expensive mics. For less than $40 it's a no brainer buy them keep them as back up mics. I'll buy another 3 pack soon just to have around.                 
I have owed 10 or 12 of these things over the years. They are a great 'stop gap' affordable mic                
These mics work fine for PA system in church. They provide clear audio for those speaking. They were a very good value.                
Compared side by side to a 58, it performs admirably. The gain and off axis rejection are on par. It is definitely a bit more nasally and less smooth than the 58.                
The box and clips were surprisingly good quality. The switch, however, has a small design flaw. It is press fit into the switch hole (as on most mixers, etc). This becomes a problem if you are like me and gaff tape over the switch for some gigs, because removing the tape means pulling the switch handle out. Given, it presses back into place just fine, but it can become a hassle. Also, the center portion of the mic cannot be disassembled to bypass/repair the switch.                
Not nearly the weight of a 58, but still reasonably sturdy feeling. The ball and capsule appear surprisingly solid (the capsule itself has a metal grill over it in addition to the mic ball, impressive). The xlr jack is a bit of a tight fit and some cords have a hard time locking in place, but with some wiggling they will.                
This is one of those deals that shouldn't require too much thought. If you could use a few decent throw-away mics, get this kit.                
Meh, gaff tape over the Behringer logo and swear to the backup singers its a sennheiser.                
Keep these mics until you have the budget for some 58s.                
You cannot go wrong for $20.  I've bought microphones that were $500 that sounded much flatter and lifeless.  I record into 8 or 4 track recorders and process into a program like ableton live, so I tweak everything afterward.  Tweak it up, compress, eq  and this mic is awesome.  My voice is sultry so it sounds awesome.  My only beef was that Fed Ex delivered my package to my neighbor's house across the street.  Good thing I was home and saw that.  
Buy it.                
Look,
I read the reviews, listened to youtube clips, etc...I'm a lead vocalist in a hard rock cover band and needed a better microphone.Bottom line, Whether this mic is as good as an sm58 is irrelevent.This thing is under $30, if you feel the need to buy a name than by all means,spend $100 on an SM58.But, obviously your not wanting to spend a bunch of cash on a mic,or you wouldn't be reading this right now. lolneither was I.I mean come on,I'm not a multi-platinum musician, and neither are you.I play in a band, we play bars, I bought this mic and it does the job just fine.If you buy it you'll have no regrets,as I said, it's under $30 for petes sake...                
we have 3 of these along with three sm58's, and and a difference between the 2 brands can't be heard.  the shure is slightly hotter, but that is easily compensated for on the board.  xm8500 has a good hearty wheight in the hand,  very little to no  mic handling noise.  our church has used them live for well over a year, and i have even used to record drums (especially toms) and guitar with great results.  best part?  you can get 5 of these for the $$ of the other brand!!                
I'm a professional sound engineer with my own sound company. I bought one of these microphones on a whim, thought I would use it for a backup. I had sennhauser misc for vocals, then I tried this mic. It sounds great! From then on I use this mic for front vocals, it's that good. Many singers look at it, and I tell them to at least try it. Everyone that has tried it likes it, and are amazed it's a Beringer. I'm thinking of getting a few more, why not, I want to see what else I can use them for. I'm very happy with it.                
I bought this Mic frm zZounds a few months ago and it is an excelent buy. Great sound, no noise and is well made. The singer in my friends band uses it every gig and she love it, it really brings out the great quality of her vocals. All in all an excellent Mic for anyone whether you gig every week or just once in a while.. BUY IT :)                 
I bought this microphone on a whim. I thought for $20 what do I really have to lose if it's a lemon. I just got it today and I put it through the wringers. I'm not a fan of the Shure SM58 microphone. This microphone puts the SM58 to the curb. I never seen what the big deal was on the Shure SM58. I never caught the fever and didn't understand all the hype. If you're going to go with a Shure microphone go with the Beta 58A if you want to spring the money for one. But getting back to this Behringer microphone. I couldn't believe I was singing through a $20 microphone. It is incredible. Like I said I'd put it up against the overrated Shure SM58 any day of the week. All I can say is give it a try and I'm sure you'll be writing a review similar to mine. Try it. You'll like it.                 
If you are a real professional vocalist, musician or sound man, this mic will not suit your needs. This mic lacks the full, "warm" sound that I am used to when I use my EV or a Shure. Feedback and handling noise is a real problem with this mic. For the price I would recommend this mic for young kids still in the garage, but not for the serious stage.                
I love this mixer! As stated by others effects usage is probably the hardest part of the mixer to figure out, but hey that's what there YouTube channel is there for and it was a lot of help in that area. My primary use is for my weekly karaoke gig. And the sound I'm able to get using the parametric eq's to bring out the vocals for my singers. Every week my crowds are growing as my singers pass the word around. And I get great comments from the club owners and singers. My next purchase will be the xr18 just for the more advanced recording flexibility, the xr12 only does 2 channel stereo recording and I want to be able to tweak my singers recordings and I'll be able to do that with the xr18. And the built in wireless works great with no issues and has great range to sit in the back of the room to make adjustments with my iPad. I've been able to reduce the weight of my 10 space rack case system by 20lbs removing components because it's all built on the the xr12.                 
This has made my sound stand out. I used 4 Behringer CE500bk with this mixer. Im so impressed with what it did. It made 4 80 watt powered speakers sound like I had MORE then 4 80 watt powered speakers!! This has the dacs and audio processing that cleans the sound up nicely. And no noise. I used for speech and light background music. But after doing that I see I can do a lot more sound wise.
4 mic inputs with 4 pair of 1/4" plugs. 2 of which are low z for direct instrument hook up. the 4 mic inputs are phantom powered as well. Aux sends and all channels are completely assignable thru the software. iOS, Android Windows. All work with no problems. There are so many features I can't begin to go thru them all on this review.                
Only thing you will need to setup is router. I used a simple NetGear router ($21) and plugged the mixer into port 1 on router. set up my own personal wireless network that only my iPad sees.                 
Its built well. You can put this unit under the table (not on the floor or ground) and just have the router on the table top, with the computer, tablet or phone running your controls. It has rack ears as well and rubberized sides. Also has handles.                
Its a win. All tech that do sound must get one.                
Didn't need it                
IM still finding out more about it.                
Overall, this mixer has everything you would need and some.                
This mixer makes everything sound better. It has so many features I'm still finding stuff everyday. Like other reviews have said, manuals are not helpful for features. 
I used this mixer with 4 Behringer CE500bk and 3 audio Technica mics and an iPad for back ground music. Just that alone was enough for close to 300 ppl to hear announcements and music. 
The effects are controlled via the iPad. The features with the iPad, Android or Windows are just amazing. You have so much control over your sound. You have full rack equipment all in your tablet ( maximizers, compressors, reverb, stereo exciters and many more) for total control over your sound. The software is stable and doesn't crash. 
I set mine up with a simple netgear router with the Ethernet cable plugged into "1" slot on router to the Ethernet on the mixer. I left the mixer under the table and all cables under the table. Only things on top the table is the iPads and router. And that's the setup. At home I found use for it in my  desk recording studio setup. It bring my music out full and up front. 
Behringer has made an excellent product yet again.                 
I've been a sound guy, singer, musician for a long time and the flexibility this little piece of equipment gives me and my band is unlike anything I've seen come along in regards to mixing. The quality of the sound is spot on, quiet, and responsive. I am nor experiencing any latency at all! It has all of the tools of the large digital boards, but without having to run a snake to a sound table that you had to either find a hole to set up or move a few people in the audience to set up....now I can sit right in the middle of them only taking up my seat and do all the mixing and fine tuning I need to do for whomever I'm mixing for! Only downfall is learning fx...a little tricky. And....all this for $299? Crazy!                 
I've been using this mixer for 6 months now and I have been impressed with it's ease of use and features that are included.  I've been a DJ/Karaoke host for 20+ years and this is the best mixer I have ever owned.  I'm able to bring out the singers voice with parametric eq's and ring out the speakers from the main mix.  I have every possible effect if could need for any situation.   and the price point is the best feature of all.  i've been able to remove 4 other pieces of equipment from my rack case because this mixer has every thing built into the software that I was using.   external eq's, reverb/delay, compressors.   I've dropped at 10 LBS out of my rack.  and packing in & out on a nightly basis this mixer has made things a lot easier on the back.                
First things first:  the mixer sounds good and it's easy to use.  Wi Fi works well and the unit is made well enough to last, if you treat it properly (as with any piece of equipment) - The things I would like changed (they could be via firmware and software updates) are:  
1) as it stands INSERT EFX take a spot from the SEND effects.  That's a limitation because the inserts effect should be a separate entity from the send effects.  Processing power should not be an issue nowadays when you have phones that can do amazing things.  Seems Behringer is stripping down the unit for no reason.
2)  The USB playback does NOT read mp3! If you want to play music on breaks and/or use some backing tracks you will have to do everything in WAV, the ONLY supported format. Again, totally unnecessary limitation and a short sighted one.
3)  You can use the 31 band EQ on STEREO out and BUSSES only - if you want to take care of problematic feedback on individual channels using the 31 band eq...you can't.
4) on the subject of feedback: why not add an automatic, real time feedback process since Behringer already has it in other units? They already have the software. OF course, you can tune the room before but, that's not always possible on smaller gigs, especially when people are already there. No one wants to listen to you "ringing" the speakers.
5)  Would have been nice to have an additional STEREO out with an analog volume control. There is a phone out but, would be nice to have another out for monitoring the live mix with a set of speakers in certain situations.
Those are my wish list changes. The mixer does sound good and it's super easy to use. Some the UI could be improved and surely they will continue to issue new updates to both firmware and software.  
Their support is non-existent as is the documentation. The Wiki page is useless for the most part and their forums seem to be taken over by "know-it-all" users that look down upon features request making it useless to post there. I hope Behringer addresses those issues. I think in an effort to cut down on their customer service expenses they have actually created an endless (and useless) loop of Wiki Page, links that are wrong, lacking documentation and hostile forums.                
It sounds beautiful.  clean and clear, with no hum present.  the sound control is crazy.  My guitarist plugged direct in and through all the FX options was able to model his desired amp tone, as well as all the pedals he used.  If you are a minimal pedal fiend, the four channels within the single guitar channel are enough.  If you are an effects fanatic, you can use the fx loop option and run it before or after.  The control over your sound is just plain nuts.  It carries effects for each of the 16 channels, you can set up memory presets and switch your sound for individual parts of each song in your set lists, which your sound guy can change or roadie, if you are lucky enough to have one.                
Want to record into a computer for an album? check.  Want to run and charge your iPhone while you are on a break? check.  I listed the features per channel in the sound section.  Have an Android phone?  You can run your mix.  Have an iPhone?  Get an iPad.  This is my only gripe, and its not much of one.  You can operate from an Android phone, but not an iPhone.                
Once you download the ap, you can get started right away.  I wish Behringer had included a little further instruction.  There are so many functions and so much capability of this system, I'm sure the book would weigh 20lbs.  There also is not much I could find on the Behringer website.  I will continue to look.  However, just playing around with the system, finding new features and options are easy and take a little trial and error in some areas, but everything is easy to work through and you can always find your way home and undo any mistakes.  This ting is genius...just wish there were more instructions.                
So far so good.  I addressed this in the review section.                
What you get for the price is insane.                
More instructions would be nice, but I repeat myself.  You can find your way through, and I would guess that's as good a way to learn as any.                  
I am completely blown away...did I mention all this music mix goodness only weighs 8lbs?  Hooray for easier load in and out.  We lost 90lbs by switching to this system and leaving the Peavey board at home.                
This mixer is so much more than I expected, especially for the price.  Everything will be detailed further in the review, and there's a lot of it.  They do not do justice to the features and capability on the product description...or the box it comes in for that matter.  The features on this mixer put it up there with most of your high-end mixers like Prosonus and the ilk.  As time goes by, the only thing I will be watching the durability and built quality, as with all things.  But comparatively, even if it breaks, I can replace it four times and still not equal the price of the major name mixers, so I'm not really that concerned.  I will continue to update.                
I love this thing! It's a little noisy but not bad for live applications. My only complaint is the manual is only available on wiki. I'd rather have something I can download and keep with me. This mixer is not for the novice; it has a lot of great features I haven't even begun to try yet.                 
What a great value in a digital mixer. I don't know how Behringer continues to crank out such HQ stuff at these prices but I'm thankful they do. My only complaint is that the USB is not a bi-directional audio I/O.  Seems like they could've easily implemented an audio interface via USB.                
By far my best investment in musical equipment ever!  Easy to use, easy to save rooms, easy to setup, easy to take down!                 
the purchase and I arrived on a Wednesday and Friday and the use did not have any kind of problem, The EQ and the Efx are very good                
Just purchased my second XR16 and could not be more happy. The unit arrived promptly and in fresh, sealed packaging. This mixer is a complete game changer for the small live video production arena. It's built solidly with high quality connectors and a practical 3RU space requirement. I strongly urge any purchaser considering using a tablet computer to use the Android app rather than the IOS application. I read a review by someone who said the Android app was a better interface and that is true, in fact it's brilliant. The MacOS application is also superb and works perfectly. My only warning is if you choose to rackmount the device you should use locktite or lockwashers on the screws holding the rack-wings. The screws will back-out if you travel the gear on any commercial jet.                
I'm not really happy with the Behringer X16 for several reasons. When I ordered it, it was defective (no power) I since replaced and notice that the wifi antenna is very fragile. The instruction manual is not helpful at all. I find myself going to YouTube quite often because the Behringer staff doesn't seem to cover the basic troubleshooting needed for new users.                
Mixer works great when its working. But can become a nightmare when it's not. When I first bought it, I tested and played with all its features. However, I used it at an ideal gig education was a short theatre performance. I could not link the mixer to 3 different devices and the customer was on my butt. I ended up grabbing an analog console. Customer lost, Lesson learned.

The Midas preamps in this board are excellent. Our friends, fans and even club owners have commented about the improvement sound, particularly complimenting the clarity of our vocals - none of them knowing that we have changed out equipment. The intelligibility and cohesion of our mix is noticeably improved.                 
The most obviously useful feature here is the built-in WiFi that will support up to 4 devices at once. I use a 10" Samsung tablet for a mixer view, and an additional smaller tablet to keep the FX window available for tempo tapping. My guitarist uses his droid phone to mix monitors. We've never had a signal dropout.
The RTA built-in to the graphic EQ on every output has afforded me the best monitor mixes we have ever had. All of the audio processing in this mixer are outstanding.                 
There is a learning curve with this board, however it is pretty easy to get a great sound. One must remember that the user has to tell this board how you want your signal routed, i spent a couple of tense moments on night #1 before I noticed that I had not yet specified that the software Buss 1 had to be routed to the physical Aux 1 in the app.                 
I am impressed with the build quality. The jacks and switch are of good quality. The WiFi antenna seems like it might be a little bit vulnerable, but nothing makes me question how long this mixer will last. Seems pretty tough.                 
I think this mixer is a real sleeper - a small device with huge performance. I have had zero buyer's remorse and would gladly buy another one.                 
There is quite a bit of user info sharing on the web, whereas Behringer doesn't offer much in-depth instruction or support. I didn't really need it, and I doubt you would either.                
Huge wow factor here with the wireless mixing!                
I am very impressed with this mixer. I perform 2-3 times per week with my 4-piece rock band and primarily wanted to downsize some of our bulky PA gear. I did not expect the quantity and quality of outstanding features that the XR18 offers and delivers on. The networking and WiFi aspects were a little intimidating before I opened the box but have proven to be flawless. I had planned on giving myself a week to become acclimated to this mixer before taking it on a gig - I ended up using it and getting great results the same night that it arrived. We have now used the XR18 on at least 20 gigs and I am completely pleased and totally impressed.                
Out of the box the unit was very intuitive and easy to use for me, an old school analog type. After one practice we used the mixer for a gig with the iPad Ap.  Every thing worked great. Our sound guy had his own iPad and we had one on stage to tweak monitors as needed. Based on reading and watching several tutorial videos, It does appear that the Android Ap is more robust, and we will give that a try eventually.  I would recommend looking up some videos and sorting through them for new ideas and applications.  Overall very satisfied with the unit and with zZouns with this my second purchase from them.                
Our band has been using the XR18 for 8 months (or so). Set up in small venues is great; no hassling with a snake and mixers, just put the box on the stage, plug in and do all the mixing from a tablet.
Issues we've had has been related to adapting to the mixer applications. Each different device (iPad, Android, Windows) are programmed slightly different. They are laid out differently and may have features that aren't found between apps. For instance, mixing just for monitors in a bus output to the stage; I set an Android device in front of the guitar player - the Android app allows you to select and show only the faders for a given output (such as bus1). This allows the guitar player to dial in his own mix without accidently changing the main mix. 
I am the keyboard player and bought one for personal use with my DAW. Through USB, it is possible to record 16 channels straight to audio channels in the DAW. I have yet to try this out, but it seems pretty straight-forward. In the meantime, I've been bringing it to our practice and working with the others in the band to show them the capabilities it has. We've been experimenting with the effects; there are so many things to choose from. It makes sense that the musicians get to know how this thing works. Our sound man has encouraged us to work with this thing so we all have an easier time when it comes to setting up and performing.                
I haven't had a chance to A/B the pre's on this with any other unit, but I will say that they sound good.                
Where do I even start? This thing will replace an entire refrigerator rack full of gear. The 6 buses are great for monitor mixes. Being able to record live performances on the track level is absolutely amazing (I would recommend checking out TracksLIVE for recording). Having EQ/Comp/Gate settings on each channel is great. I haven't really dug into the FX yet, but what little I've heard sounded good.                
There IS a learning curve to this unit and if you're not familiar with the basics of technology I could see you having a difficult time initially. HOWEVER, it's definitely worth spending the time familiarizing yourself because once you get the hang of it it will make running sound infinitely easier in the long run.                
The unit build itself seems to be quality. It comes with rack ears and once installed it sits solid in the rack. The Combo jacks seem like they will stand up to years of use.                
Amazing value. Like I mentioned before it has already saved me approx $500 on In ear monitors, and it will also save you time and money by replacing tons of outboard gear you no longer have to haul around.                
I haven't dealt directly with support, but they do have a product forum in which they are active. There are facebook groups for the XR series and I see company reps answering questions in there quite a bit. Also, Their dev dept seems to be on the ball with frequent firmware updates and application updates.                
Digital mixers such as this one are game changers. For me the HUGE wow factor here is being able to run your monitor mix from a phone. Everyone knows a bad monitor mix can derail and entire show, now there are no more excuses. Also being able to track your live performances w/o any additional hardware (other than a laptop) is amazing.                
For many years I wouldn't even allow anything with the name "Behringer" into my signal chain. But when i saw the XR18 and all of the features it promised I had to check it out. I've had it for a few months now and mainly use it for band rehearsal with in ear monitor mixes. First and foremost, the unit almost immediately paid for itself with it's headphone output. You can assign the headphone source to just about anything, so in our case we assigned it to BUS5 and use it as a monitor mix for our drummer. This not only saved us from having to spend $500 on ANOTHER IEM pack, but he also gets his own dedicated monitor mix.I've read other reviews where people complain about the built in wifi cutting out but I haven't had any issues with it. However, the 2.4ghz spectrum (wifi) can get pretty crowded in some areas, and this can cause problems with ANY wireless device so if you plan to gig with this unit I would always be prepared to run hardwired to a laptop in a worst case scenario.There are currently applications released for Windows/OSX android & Ipad, but it's my understanding that an iphone app is still under development. Don't let the lack of an iphone app hold you back though. I use a cheapo $40 android tablet to control my XR18 and it works great. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase. The bang for your buck factor here is extremely high.                
I purchased this about a month ago and, given all the features it has and the low price, I was a bit skeptical that it would deliver. How wrong I was !  We have been using it for all our gigs and it has proved to be the best investment I've ever made. We all run in-ear monitors from a separate bus so, everyone has his own personal mix. Each guy has the app on a phone or, tablet and, can tailor his own monitor mix to suit his taste. FOH could not be easier as you can walk around the club and get the mix perfectly set. The lack of running snakes, carrying equipment racks, and wedges cut our setup time dramatically ( And made it easier on our backs)  We are a 5 piece Country, Rock, R&B band and, this mixer is a must-have for any gigging band.                
We just replaced half of our sound system with this thing. Small live venue we replaced our snake, Mackie 24.4 and all our rack gear. If you properly set up the gain staging this thing is awesome in a live setting, the mic pre's are clear, the built in dynamics work amazingly well. We just purchased 3 Kindle fires to run the xair Q app so monitors can be run from the stage. speaking of monitors the graphic eq with built in rta made ringing out the monitors so easy, I was able to do it myself from the stage. Built in effects are not bad either                
I work at a night club 7 days a week I use this 7 days a week. I have famous Mexican bands come in and some bring their engineer some bring expensive gear. I have out beat them with this. People have ask me to teach them the come in with yamahas tf5 and the have years ahead of me. I have a secret I play 7 instruments and heir it all. This is all you need and pride. Has all you need good fx and echo compression gate. Bottom line what els you want?? Something that does the work for you? Then don't call your self an engineer                
My only regret is not buying one sooner. 
Do your homework. Watch as many videos as possible. It's easy to get a solid mix in a short time. This unit eliminated two racks of gear. The endless effects (up to 4 per channel), 6 aux sends (I use one for subs), and an affordable price tag. We've used it for months, and no hiccups at all. If you're looking for an affordable digital mixer, this is the one.                
I have had this for over two weeks and have used it on about 8 gigs so far. The more I use it the better it gets. Highly tweakable! Sounds awesome!!! Only downside is the different app interfaces between the different platforms. I have familiarized myself with them all pretty good so it isn't that much of a pain to deal with now.                
Lots to like about this mixer - small footprint, extra line inputs (17,18), easy to use, apps are pretty easy to navigate.  It has two glaring flaws and they're both related to the built in WiFi.  
First, 802.11g is an old protocol and for looking at screen redraws, it's slow and laggy.  If more than one device is connected, it can take 3-5 seconds to register a fader move.  That's useless in a live situation.  
Second, the encryption options are Open, which no one should do, or WEP, which was cracked more than a decade ago.  
Since wireless IS the interface of this mixer, you should expect to add $100 or more to the cost for a good, but small wireless router to keep in your gear bag.  It's a huge overlook that was clearly driven by marketing to say wireless was built in.  Mackie is coming out with a similar mixer, and hopefully it doesn't fail here too.                  
Just purchased and am using it with Logic Pro X. The way it has increased my efficiency and workflow is mind-blowing. And the best part is it actually works! I didn't rate manufacturer because I haven't used them.                
This is a great controller for the price. But, I use Pro Tools primarily, so the device is limited by HUI limitations. So, in Pro Tools the master fader (9th) is inoperative. Most people are aware of this HUI limitation already. But another HUI limitation is that the scribble strips are not in full color, just black/gray backlit.Having said that, the scribble strips are impossible to read unless you're right on top of the surface, literally. I have to mix standing over the unit in order to see the strips. Other than that, it's great, I plan to buy another for 16 channel control.                
If you are a Logic Pro user this thing is awesome. in fact i am starting to think they created the X-Touch primarily for Logic. It was easy to set up and all the buttons work as they are supposed to. In my opinion, Behringer hit a home run with this one. for the price you are not going to find a better controller for Logic Pro.I also use Pro Tools and Digital Performer. With these, the X-touch works, but there is less functionality. The faders, pan and transport all work fine but not all the special function buttons. I am hoping in future updates this will be fixed. but since logic is my primary DAW, i am thrilled with the X-Touch                
I use this with Presonus studio one. This is really a surface controller for Logic so you won't get a lot of the bells and whistles if you use it with anything but. It's really limited with Pro-Tools. I use it in conjunction with a Xtouch compact and they both work flawlessly together. Again, this was really designed for Logic but it suits my needs for what I use it for.                
this controller worked instantly and perfectly with my software (reaper, harrision mixbus, tracktion). it does everything as advertised and the fader noise isn't noticeable to me when i'm using to mix. 
my only real compliant is that it is a bit bigger then i'd like. it's sorta boxy and feels a little oversized. mostly it's too tall and a bit bulky / chunky. on the plus side it feels very sturdy. 
when i received it noticed it was used. it appears i was sent accidentally sent a refurbished unit instead of a new one. 
i contact zZounds and they were super helpful. they offered a full refund / return or exchange at no cost to me. they also offered me a generous partial refund. i went with the partial refund and kept the unit, because it works perfectly and does exactly what i thought it would do. 
also, i tried to register it with behringer so i could claim my free tracktion 7 daw software download code. i contacted behringer several times and they never responded to give me my warranty registration infor or my download code. not a big deal but i was hoping to get the tracktion software as advertised.                 
I never review products, but this one is worth taking the time. Excellent Stuff! I am very meticulous and precise when it comes to setting up my guitars. Tuning inconsistencies bug the hell out of me. Even with good locking tuners and a Graphtech nut, the tuning stability of my Wilkinson tremolo was alway a little erratic. Adding just a tiny bit to each nut slot during string changes makes my Tremolo action and tuning smooth and stable.                
I have 6 guitars of which one is a Gibson Led Paul. Gibson guitars can be difficult to keep in tune due to the angle of the neck and string nut pressure ratio. I've used the product on my Gibson & other guitars and found it to be useful in keeping my stringed instruments in tune. I can attest that it does a great job and I have found no better performing product currently on the market. Want to keep your guitar in tune with minimal clean up after application? This will do the job for you. Thanks zZounds for your outstanding service!                
Use this stuff at every string change on all contact points. It would probably be best used on the nut and protect it from wear. Would recommend this stuff to buy.                
Clear, penetrating, full sound, with a  pitch range that inspires experimentation with new sounds.                
Videos are good, expecially because a theremin is an instrument that most will have to learn without a teacher.                
It is made well, although since I do not travel with the instrument, I cannot attest to its ruggedness when disassembled and reassembled on a regular basis.                
It is what you have to pay in order to get a good theremin, so it is worth the price.                
Moog music ws very helpful when contacted. They took an interest in my problem, which was one related to tuning the instrument when tuning was beyond the capacity of the external controls.                 
 A theremin is an instrument that always amazes those who hear it. This is not so with, say, a piano, guitar or drumset. Sometimes the theremin seems more interesting than the performer.                
When I bought it, it was considered to be the one to buy... maybe not the most expensive, but a serious instrument. Now, whenever there is a better instrument out, I will want it.                 
Theremins have different sounds. Other review statements notwithstanding, this is neither the only theremin on the market, nor the least expensive. Bob Moog was most instrumental (pun gently intended) in bringing the theremin back to public consciousness, and the Etherwave models are quite playable, though non-linear in pitch response. What distinguishes them from others is the more brass-like sound. Others (soundslikeburns, for instance) have the more string/vocal sonority. It's all about preference.                
Quite good. There are two knobs that, when used together, allow some slight changes in tonality. Subtle but there. I love the 3/8" rod antennae. They look substantial and are attractive. The instrument can be ordered from various sources in a variety of finishes, including black, white, and several wood stain colors.                 
Theremin is not an easy instrument to play, but it's a serious one. Expect it to take practice. Avail yourself of some of the online lessons on YouTube by Thomas Grillo. Peter Pringle and Moog offer instructional DVDs. Many theremin players are self-taught. Don't kid yourself, be patient and prepared to suck while you learn the ropes. No frets, no keys, nothing to guide you but sense memory and practice, practice, practice.                 
The build seems excellent to me. Most Moog products throughout the company's history have been built with pride and passion.                 
One might wish they were still making the Etherwave Pro. It had a more linear response, and looked really cool. Lots of people are playing them on YouTube. But it's history, and used ones are commanding in the $6000 range! For the price, if you like the brass-like sonority (I didn't, preferring the more string-like or vocal sound of the B3) it's a complete winner at this price. But a good, playable unit can be had for half this.                
I haven't used it personally, but Moog support is fabled.                 
Like every Moog product, it does what it does with sturdiness, style, elegance and that Moog charm we've known since the '70''s. The  Moog legacy is being carried on proudly, though the world is poorer for the loss of Dr. Bob.                
From what I understand, people keep these for a long time. Why not? Sturdy build, attractive unit, good performance for the price.                 
The sound can't quite compare to the original theremins, but it is still excellent. Very tweakable.                
The theremin does not come with it's stand, but the knobs are very useful.                
Do not buy this thinking it will be easy to play. It is extremely difficult if you actually want to play. Sound effects are simple to produce, but true music takes dedicated practice.                
Although this is the only theremin on the market as of now, I do believe were there another one it could not be any better in construction.                
This can turn any concert into a magic show. It can mesmerize your audiences.                 
This instrument will stay with me hopefully for the rest of my life. Do not get this without getting a stand, and be prepared to suck at playing for a few weeks. When the playing is good however, it's a beautiful thing.                 
I think it sounds wonderful, like something between a trumpet, a human voice and a radio being tuned. amazing!                
I don't know, as I dont have one, though I would like to.                
Already owning the 1st gen of this pre, I knew it was good! The 1st gen is so thick and big sounding along side of being very smooth. Really smoothing out the "s" sound compared to other pres. I recently bought a UA 710 $800 pre and the 1st gen BLA stomped that one in the ground and at only $350. both Ua 710 and BLA had heavy hiss at high gains More so with the 710 and the BLA only had 30db gain. So returned the 710 and got this new BLA B12a Mk II and YAY! Sounds so good just like the first gen and with this one we have 50db gain along with barely any hiss even at maxed out gain! Black Lion Audio really know what they are doing and they charge less for more compared to UA where we pay for the name as well.                
This clock is by far the best possible upgrade one could make to their studio for under  $5000, and it only costs 1/5 of that! I have heard other clocks ten times the price, that although did likewise bring an absolute and undeniable improvement,  the improvement was not as drastic as with this BLA mk3, nor was it as easily affordable. This company is really doing something right and I don't know how long they've been around or how long they can keep this up, but I hope they do because their products are changing the game for small studios where every dollar must be wisely invested to maximize sonic improvements and keep us relevant in this competitive market.                
I usually wouldn't blink when thinking of an amp to buy and skip Blackstar without thought, but This amp is different.  They build a dual channel amp that stays really clean on Channel A but Channel B Goes easily to the end of breakup.  This is definitely a pedal platform and a well designed version at that.  There is more than enough volume for any gigs I do these day.. all of which has big PA systems and in ear monitors. Though this is a total curveball by Blackstar, it is a refreshing change. In an odd way, it reminds me of the Fender Deville, Michael Landua. which it two channel of clean... You get more power amp distortion due to the lower output wattage., which I think adds to the palate of tone you can get with this amp.                 
I play electric guitar weekly for my church which meets in an older, brick style room with minimal sound engineering thought out into it. We're also playing monitorless and without an amp room. Right off the bat, the odds are NOT in my favor. ***note - I'm running a Squier VM '72 tele thinline into an always on MXR custom comp with the volume at noon and sustain all the way down (because church volumes)***My goal for an amp is something that can sound decent at the (lack of) volume which I play at. I was really excited for this amp due to the versatility it boasts and all the reviews of it online. I loved the idea of different voicings for the channels and I couldn't wait to try the ISF knob. These were what I was excited for most when I bought it. Features: Channel one isn't for me. I don't know if it's because I can't cook the tubes, but it never sounds full. Think AM radio. The ISF is really interesting because it. It only changes the sound, but also the range of the BMT controls. The Bass gets boomy-er on the UK side, and the Mids are more responsive on the US side. I do like the reverb. I tend to keep it below 10 o'clock for a little space. I've got pedals for the absurd stuff. I haven't tested out the emulated output yet since all of our di's are in use.Quality: I don't know if mine is faulty, or if it needs to be retubed (damaged in transit?), but there's a constant hiss even when everything is turned down including the master volume. It gets covered by normal amp hiss the louder you turn up, but at bedtime levels, it's louder than your guitar. At daytime apartment levels, it's still prominent when you're not playing, but not louder than the guitar (think metal players without a noise gate). My iOS db meter clocks it at ~60 db.Sound: I decided to go with 3.5 stars because I did find a sound that I like so far (we've been playing as a 3 piece so far, we'll have 2 keyboardists join us this week). So far, Ive found that channel 1 doesn't work for me (at least at these volumes) and the UK side hides in my mix. Even a Sparkle Drive couldn't pick me back up. However, I decided to test the US side before I traded this amp in for something else and I'm glad I did! It's in your face, in the good way! Like I've mentioned, the bass is tight and the mids are more present. This definitely helps to cut through the mix. It sounded great this past week with only bass and drums, we'll see if it holds up this week when we have 2 keyboardists join us. So far, I like it. Time will tell if I end up trading it in for a fender if I'm only using it for fender tones anyways.Ease of Use: here's where it gets tricky. The controls seem easy enough, but the ISF totally changes the voicing of the tone controls for channel 2. When I turn the ISF, I always have to tweak the bass and mids.Value: Me, I might have gone either with an ac15, blues jr or even a hot rod deluxe. All of which are cheaper than this. However, I would still like to try this with the tubes cooking, possibly with an attenuator.The Wow Factor: I'm not able to play at loud volumes, but I was hoping for something versatile that sounds good at lower to moderate levels. That is not this amp. It's also a little noisy when there's no signal, so this definitely wouldn't have been my choice for church where there's a lot of downtime between sets.                
First off, I love black stars features and the love they put into there products. When I received mine visual everything was pleasing to look at. Features wise, it had everything I needed for the music I play (effects loop, 2 channels, etc). The sound however I would describe it as warm and farty when cranked. Maybe I got defect on the isf controls but no matter how much I played with the tone, I could never get a clear bright clean tone. I was just gonna wait it out till I could have a replacement but instead I returned it and went with a voxac30c2x.                 
Just got this last week and absolutely love it........can't wait to get the 5 button footswitch which will essentially make this a 6 channel amp with 3 channels and a boost for all of them.......zZounds staff was great and very patient with me as I first ordered a fender hot rod deluxe which had a problem......then a marshall dsl 40 combo that I just didn't care for the sound.........good amp just not the sound I was looking for then a marshall origin 20 combo.....sounded great but not enough power.......all good amps just not what I was looking for......then I got this and everything I wanted was there.......cleans that are amazing and the overdrives are some of the finest I've ever heard........and the reverb is quite nice and very useable unlike many amps I've played........plus the 12 monthly payments makes this quite affordable and in my budget.........many thanks to Blackstar and zZounds for making me sounds as good as I can........oh yea........buy one of these you'll love it......have not needed tech support but assuming it will be great too                
I was looking for an all in one amp for home use and gigs. I live in an apartment so I can't afford to be loud all the time. The 4 watt mode tames the amp very nicely. It can get plenty of saturation at volumes lower than the tv. The clean channel is just that. Clean. It is on par with my Peavey classic 30. The gain channel can be shaped to sound any way you like. I would recommend this amp for any style of player. The reverb isn't going to blow you away but I always prefer pedals to onboard fx.                 
I have been a Blackstar amp owner and guitar player for 40+ years.  This amp has what it takes to be a front runner whether playing at home or gigging out.  The cleans are crystal clear and the the OD channel is absolutely amazing.  With the voicing switch, it allows you to put a little dirt in the clean channel and makes the OD channel come alive.  Blackstar hit the nail on the head with this series of amps.  I highly recommend you purchase one....you won't regret it....                
Well it ain't going to set the world on fire with volume. BUT it is plenty loud for it's intended use. it is perfect for jamming along with your computer, DVDs, MP3s. It's cute. Delay is very good. Gain is good and not cheap or tinny. I got it for desktop use to play along with lick lessons. No need to plug in a big amp. This little guy has really nice clean to grit tone without blowing the windows out. Especially for blues. It cleans up rolling the volume back like a big amp. And it seems to be pick sensitive. Don't worry about the little speaker fizzing out. It would be great for traveling and playing in a hotel room. It could get loud enough to annoy neighbors in a hotel room.It does sound like a full size amp and it is very addicting to play. At some time I may spring for the extension speaker but for now it is perfect.                
This box sounds good for what it is. Way better than those other minis. Watch the shoot out on you tube. Clean and overdrive and delay all sound good. I have a blast with it and dont have to fire up my stack or other large amps. I leave it on my bar and when i want to practice just plug in and turn it on. I actually play more now since its so handy. I haven't had to use manufacturers support.                
It works great for rehearsing and accompanying acoustic guitars. It's bigger than I thought it would be which is a good thing because from the pictures I thought it would fall over with a cord plugged in. It doesn't! It just sits there and busts out great sound. Oh, and zZounds made the deal easy.                
Amp is very light duty. I feel like I might blow the Speaker. Good for jamming tunes but not so good for Bass. I would spend the extra and get a Roland Bass cube .                
Love this little amp.
Sounds great.
The clean channel has a bit better sound than the OD channel.
There are plenty of demos on YouTube to hear for yourself.
The mini stack comes in a box. Blackstar doesn't make a carry case for the 2 speakers, which would have been nice.
Who wants to carry their portable amp around in a box?
Not me.
Fortunately I was able to find a nice case on Amazon.
The speakers fit perfectly in the bag. There are also side pockets which hold the power cord very nicely.
The seller is eCost Connection, and the bag is listed as "large digital camera/video padded carry bag".
I have absolutely no relationship with this bag company. Just trying to help out my fellow Blackstar amp lovers.
I've owned this amp for over a year now, and I still play it everyday. It's such a great amp. I get the same feeling I got when I plugged it in for the first time every time I play it. It's tone is excellent. It breaks up super easy, and it man oh man, it is LOUD! I wasn't expecting a 1watt amp to be this loud. And like most tube amps, it sounds best cranked to 11. It's basically a one channel amp with an overdrive switch. Without the overdrive engaged, it still breaks up full on AC/DC with the gain on.. You have to roll the gain almost all the way off and the volume about halfway to get even close to a clean tone. Then press the overdrive switch and it's full on tube madness. The ISF is the only thing I don't like about it. It really limits it considering that's all you have EQ wise. I keep mine set all the way to the left (USA.) I think the the British side is wayyyy too mid-y. But it still sounds great at least all the way to the left IMO. I buy, sell, and trade a LOT of gear, and this amp is one I've never considered letting go of.                
This product the HT1 Blackstar combo amp performs exactly as they advertised.  I have found that it lacked a little volume, but my YJM footpedal interacts real well with the amp..  the american and british settings do represent well their respective sounds.  I really love the headphone jack; the extension speaker output is cool to have.  I feel the HT1 is a little pricey for its overall size, but it sounds great when combined with something else. It plays best when practicing with headphones, but can easily be used in a coffee shop setting or combined with an extension speaker.  I got what I was wanting_ great tone, no digital effects, practice ready and highly recordable.                
See above                
Just turn the knob left to righbt to mix american or breitish sounds has a gain switch.                
Built like a bigger amp; tubes are high end.  No problems with casinf.                
Great quality but expensive                
No                 
This was a necessary move for me as I only havwe a 2x12 which is loouud.                  
I have already gotten massive use of the HT1 and love the quality of the sound I get, especially my S series Ibanez with a tone Zone in the brifge.  It sounds like 80s metal.                
i own the ht5cr and it is simply steller. reading rave reviews about the ht1, i bought it.
my ht1 is pure fizz if you crank the gain on the clean channel. the videos sound just wonderful cranking the clean. my od channel is shrill and totally non musical. i replaced both tubes and took SOME of the shrillness out of the od channel. i installed a celestion super 8 speaker and the od channel is pure hot rod marshall now. the cranked clean still pure fizz. you shouldnt have to retube/respeaker a new amp to make it sound useable.                
This is basically a great sounding tube amp in a small size. Tube amps sound best cranked up. However, cranked up amps are not always the best for practicing and recording. And when I say practicing, I do not mean rehearsing. 
This amp can get loud (to give you great tube tone) but not terribly loud because it is only 1 watt with an 8 inch speaker. You can get fantastic cleans, crunch classic rock and some good metal tones as well. 
The "ISF" is very cool and you can change the overall character of the amp from a Fender-esque clean sound to a Vox chime to a roaring woody Marshall-esque sound. 
The reverb on the amp is digital and stereo. In reality, it sounds great and is very usable. It feels and sounds like a quality analog reverb.
 If you are looking for touch responsiveness, tube breakup (all levels), etc. this is a great amp and is very small and portable. Takes pedals well, but I have enjoyed using it without pedals for the most part. It is a high resolution amp, so if you play well, it sounds great. If you make mistakes, it will draw attention to them unlike some other amps. 
Punchiness, touch, all the tube hallmarks are here. My new favorite amp, sound-wise, for recording and practice. 
While it may seem like a beginner's amp in terms of size, it is not really made for beginners. It is a pro-level amp and does not disappoint. Also, this amp really brings out the good and bad in different guitars, pickups and even cables. 
Some amps make your gear sound generic, but this thing really lets you hear the differences, no matter how subtle, with your gear. 
For example, I have a Gretsch where the 2nd selector position (neck and bridge both on) pickup setting sounded the same, or mostly the same, to the neck pickup on its own, through my other gear (Vox amp, Digitech modeler, etc.). With the HT-1, you can hear the differences, as if someone took the pillow off my guitar in that instance, for example.
Emulated output/headphones is stereo and sounds truly great.                
I only give it a 9 for "features" because it could be slightly better if it had an effects loop perhaps. But when using an amp this small, you probably would not want to connect a bunch of other gear in your signal chain and for recording, you can do your time based effects on the computer (delay, etc.). Otherwise, you defeat the simple portability of the HT-1. 
Having said that, it does come with stereo headphone/emulated output (the reverb effect is stereo) and also stereo input for MP3/other sound sources (to play along with for example). The headphone and line-in ports are both full-size 1/4" jacks, so you may need different cables or adapters depending on your existing gear.                
Easy to use, but please take your time to dial in settings you like. Subtle changes to pre-gain and post-gain and ISF can give you a lot of different sounds. Same with reverb. Behind the simple knobs lies some delicious tone.                
Heavy for its size and very well built. The speaker, though small, is designed to take loud volume without farting out. High quality pro gear. I do not think replacing the speaker or the tubes is necessary whatsoever. Give the amp a few hours for the speaker to break in a bit. And make sure you use a really good cable. Believe it or not, different cables can improve your sounds because guitars send out tiny signals over the cable and that tiny signal is prone to changing over the length of the cable. Better cables will give you better resolution, high frequency, and sustain.                
I think it is a 10 for "value", but I give a 9 because it actually is expensive for a small amp. However, it is fantastic, so you get what you pay for in that regard. A 1 watt boutique tube amp? This is the real deal.                
Haven't had to ask for support yet - but I think Korg USA is the support department for the USA.                
I like the Blackstar asthetic, grill cloth and marketing. Look online for some of their videos. For example, if you like metal, look for Andy James playing the HT-1 using emulated output. Amazing. While it can do hard rock and classic rock, it has a great round and smooth blues tone too, and I personally mainly use mine on the clean setting with a bit of preamp tube breakup crunch.                
Great great amp, if you want to get better, this is for you.
If you are already a pro, this is for you. 
Just starting out? Maybe, but it will not give you the instant tone gratification of a modeling amp and let you go from jazz to country to insane metal by pressing a button. It will amplify your personal tone and skill. If you are just starting out, just be patient as it will not gloss over unclean playing as a lot of amps will.                
Bought this one as B-stock for $220, saving of $80. When the amp arived the clean channel sound ok, but the overdrive channel is very microphonic. I spend $10 order another preamp 12Ax7 tube. Open the back and the top rear screw on the handle, change the tube and everything sound great. Plug in my mp3 player and sound like I'm in concert.                
For it size and portability this amp is good. It give a lot of bite and growl if that is what your looking for. It can also give you clean but with very little volume. I found the sound to be tinny or boxey. I add a HT-112 12" speaker cabinet and the quality of the sound improved dramatically.                
The sound is great. I like that I can tweak the characteristics of the amp and get the singing, clear sound and then twist a few dials and it gets a little dirty without ever going over the top. I have been trying to sound like Clapton  for 15 years now and this amp has gotten me closer. Plus I can tune the amp from Sunshine to Layla. The amp is the love child of a Fender and Marshall.                
I like the ISF feature. Simple and fun. The reverb is much better than expected for a digital effect. I am a fan of spring reverb and that kept a Fender in the picture for me. However, I am a fan of the stand alone Fender reverb tank so was not a big deal in the decision.                
Easy to use; straight forward design and settings card is a great start for dialing in your sound.                
Well built; cannot find any flaws, rattles; and I bought a blemished model. I see this amp being with me for a long time.                
What a great amp for a great price. I got it to play at home. The volume is great for 5 watts and the price is awesome. I got mine less than full price but would have gladly paid $450. The blemished I got for a discount just convinced me to stop waiting and buy the amp.                
No need at this time and don't see any in the future                
Wow, wow, wow. I still want a Fender Super sonic and will justify the purchase due to the higher wattage. However, every time I play the Blackstar I forget that other amps exist. If you want one stop waiting. You are only depriving yourself of happiness. I call it a smile machine because every time I play it I can't stop smiling.                
This amp is exactly what I was looking for. I played several amps before choosing this one. The decision came down to this amp and a Fender super sonic. I love the Fender sound and reverb. the Blackstar gives a sound that is equal to the Fender but the distortion and gain are much better. The clean channel sings as sweet as a bird in spring after a long winter. The overdrive channel is full but overly dirty giving a sweet distortion that never breaks apart. what sold me is the clean channel. It is responsive and clear. I am extremely happy with the amp. I like that I can get a fender sound and then add some more gain to it. That in between settings are a sound all the amps own. If your ears have different moods and can't decide what sound you want from day to day this is your amp. Even if you are a Fender or Marshall guy this is your amp. Sometimes you need/want a little different sound and this amp does it with ease. It is a classic sound with modern function.                
Going through the stock speaker, it simply sounds amazing. The only problem I had was with the emulated output. Going through the stock speaker and using the power tubes, you can overdrive to your hearts content and it sounds great, this is not true for the emulated output. If you push the amp too hard while using the emulated output, it gives a digital distortion sound.
I found the ISF feature to be quite nice and works as advertised.
One thing to note is that if you are in an apartment, you may want to go with the 1 watt version because this one can easily get you kicked out on the dirty channel (and probably on the clean channel as well).
Just for fun, I connected my Eden D210T bass cab to this amp and it actually sounded great with my bass.                
Features are nice and simple, the reverb adds that little touch that makes you sound a little better than you are.
Has outputs for a single 8 ohm cab, 2x16 ohm cabs, or a single 16 ohm cab (the internal speaker is 16 ohm)                
Turn knobs, doesn't get much easier. The preset suggestions provided sound quite good.                
The quality is pretty good, I have doubts about how long the covering will last, but only time will tell.
I certainly don't think the handle will be breaking anytime soon though.                
Quite simply, it does a great job and what it's meant to do and for the sound quality and the price, it's definitely affordable.                
I haven't had to contact Blackstar.                
I love the Blackstar logo for sure. Plus it came with a Blackstar sticker to put on something. The grill cloth is pretty snazzy and the piping around it is a very nice touch.                
I feel this amp is versatile enough that I won't need to replace it anytime soon. I think the only reason to replace this amp would be to get the 1 watt version for a quieter practice.                 
The best clean/dirty tones I've heard in 28 years. You will find your tone with this amp it is that versatile. I use it in the studio and live. I have not played a guitar through I haven't been able to dial in a great tone for.                 
Loaded with ins and outs. Ohm selector switch for multiple speaker cabinet extensions, mp3 line in, footswitch, speaker emulated line out, and more.                
Very easy to use.                 
Sleek, black, cool, black, classic, black, did I mention it's black? And it looks awesome! Built like a tank.                
I've owned several amps in 28 years and this one exceeds the best value for the money.                
Awesome. I have it.                
There are so many amps out there that do one thing or another great, but this amp truly does it all.                
perfect practice amp! louder than you need, plus it ROCKS pushing my Marshall 4 x 12 cab!  the attack is insane and the range of tone is vast. Everything about this amp is well made and exceeds expectations! a multi-effects pedal is awesome to run through the fx loop, the only semi-necessary addition might be an eq pedal to help polish and focus especially with the clean channel (which is beautiful, but lets get real if you are looking at this amp its not for the clean), which only has a tone knob                
The amp's clean channel is warm with a smooth bell-like tone, up to about the half way mark with regards to level. Then the valves start to clip with a beautiful light drive. This is what the drive channel builds on. The overdrive channel starts off with some light valve drive all the way to fire-breathing, face-melting filth! This amp doesn't sound like a small, driven amp, but like a 100w stack going nuclear, but at a usable volume. The ISF feature is extremely effective in sculpting the tone anywhere between UK and USA, providing true versatility. Both channels share tone controls and the ISF feature                
This amp has most of the bells and whistles you can think of: Two channels - of course! It allows for headphones, an extended cab, includes a footswitch, a bank of equalizer controls, and the tone shaping feature is something I just don't get tired of playing with, and the sounds you can get from the distortion is just wonderful, and you don't have to blow down the neighbor's house with volume to get it!                
The HT5 is one of the few low-wattage tube amps that has a direct out/headphone input, which is super convenient. Don?t underestimate what 5 tube watts sounds like at full blast ? it?s definitely loud enough to irritate all but the coolest/deafest of neighbors. To that end, the 1/12 and 4/12 cab simulation w/the headphones is nice and works well when playing loud just isn?t an option. Haven?t used the direct out for recording yet, but I?ve heard good things. All in all, there?s a decent amount of competition for the HT5 (Egnater, Orange, etc.), but you simply won?t find this many features and this much tone anywhere NEAR this price elsewhere. If you need something for a small space, for practicing, or for portability without sacrificing KILLER tone, I?d definitely suggest the HT5.                 
The amp seems rugged and durable, and the overall feel of it is that it is well built. On the other hand, I have only owned it a few weeks so far - but I don't foresee any problems. The sound quality pretty much classifies this amp as being in the boutique class, and as such is at the bottom range of the boutique scale. To find an amp sound to compare it to, I think you are probably going to have to spend about a thousand dollars, so this is a steal!                 
I would by another one.                
No need for support at this time.                
Love it.                
This amp is going to go down in guitar history as a classic. It has a very warm, rich sound with more than enough volume for bedroom use. The tone with the ISF knob on the USA side is reminiscent of a hot rodded Marshall JMP. If you have a LP with Burstbuckers, you're golden. You get a nice, complex, woody crunch. On the British side,but still very ballsy and good for blues and classic rock. It even came with a footswitch. The cabinet is very solid and seems well built. And it has a Celestion! I can't find anything to complain about with this amp. I've had and sold many amps since I started playing, but this one's a keeper!                 
I got this amp about three months ago and I still haven't been able to find tone I didn't like! I sold all my electric gear about five years ago, due to economic situations. So I bought a pretty nice used guitar, and I'd been searching for the right amp. I live in a four unit apartment, so I wanted something that sounded great at lower volumes, but could also be used for some lighter live work. Well here's the problem with this amp. I love it!! I mean I really love it! I think tonewise, it's the best amp I've ever owned, and I've had quite few throughout the years! I did a lot of listening to small combos on Youtube, and decided to go with this one just from the videos and reviews. So I wanted to add my review, because I like it so much! I would've also reviewed if it sucked, or was bland, but I'm very happy to say I'm happy! And If I ever need to step up to a bigger amp, I'm going to get a Blackstar! (I have had no issues with this amp. It came very well packed, and works great!)                
A few thoughts...
The Blackbird speaker is great for high gain but it really lacks any clean tone. It just makes the amp lifeless unless you got the gain cranked. I took it out of my HT-5R combo and right now its basically a big square head running into a Vox 112NT cab loaded with a Celestion Greenback.
The Celestion Greenback really makes this amp come alive both clean and dirty. It adds some much needed sparkle to the treble and makes the cleans go from lifeless to amazing. It makes the gain channel just that much more incredible.
I do plan on putting a speaker back in it, I just have not decided what yet. I am trying to decide between a WGS Green Beret and a WGS ET65.
I am also using the stock tubes that came in it. I have no idea if they are cheap chinese tubes or high quality. It sounds good so I am not even going to mess with them. 
The price is a bit high for a 5 Watt amp but its still a reasonable value for what you get. I highly recommend this amp to anyone that either wants some killer gain or some killer gain and cleans if willing to change out the speaker. Figure after a speaker this is now close to a $600 5 watt combo.                 
Wow just wow. This little amp is amazing. I had my reservations that it may not meet my expectations since I normally play fender amps. But I must say this little thing is the best sounding amp I own now. It is also very versatile with the different tone options. It may not be the loudest amp around but for what I needed, it is more than perfect. If all Blackstar amps are this good and have this good of quality, it may be time for me to invest in a larger one for gigs as well, and put my other amps on the bench for a while. If you want a clean sounding amp that can go from crystal clear notes all the way to nice and dirty, then this amp is perfect for you. I have been playing this thing non stop since I got it and I am still just scratching the surface of what this amp can do. I foresee many years of use for this little workhorse.                
The amp is fantastic and can go from shimering cleans to eaging distortion witha click of the footswitch. This amp blows away a Blues Jr and anything else comming within hundreds of what this amp cost. You won't find a better more versatile amp anywhere regardless of price. I have been playing for 35 years and I love this amp..                
I love the sound from this amp out of the box. I was surprised to find Ruby tubes in it. I had heard they were Sovtek. So the initial sound was really good with the Ruby tube until you turn the gain on the overdrive channel. It got really over done and loss of clarity. when gain was about 7 to 10. I read some of the forums, tested a few different brand tubes in the preamp tube, changed to a JJ long plate Gold pin ECC803/12AX& and the sound went into a heavenly smooth distortion, great breakup at all levels. It is not a high gain sound but great distorted tone over all. Love this Amp.                
this amp  has a TON of features.  just read the specs. but more than that, it SOUND great. the tube "feel" is there also. very responsive to pick attack also. you can be screaming on the od channel, back off the volume and go almost to clean.  the clean channel feels and sound just fine to me. it also compresses well anywhere past "5" . i have two gripes.....the gain channel seems to be more "open" than my marshalls. i havent given up, but i havent dialed in that thick, syrupy lead tone that i get with all my marshalls.  there's tons of gain there, the eq is powerfull, but i just havent got my lead tone yet.  gripe 2.....mine does not do "crunch" tones at all. just od+. even with the gain wayy down, its od, not crunch. the verb is very useable. now, i also own the ht dual pedal. everyone says it the same ht circuits. bull.  my ht dual does perfect crunch-hot rodded jcm 800 all on the crunch channel. the od channel is instant thick, syrupy leads. my ht dual, into the clean channel of ANY amp sounds and feels more marshall THAN marshall and i own a room full of them.  if you need a quality, full featured small amp this is a good one.                
Amazing tone out of this amp for any genre or sound. I have several tube amps i use for recording but the blackstar has retired many of them since i got it. i use it for practice studio and live as a monitor utilizing the emulated out to run signal to a PA system.                
The amp sounds killer. But this is after i put a different speaker in. Celestion greenback. Original speaker very fizzy and hard to get good crunch out of. Dont let this put you off a great amp though.                
I HEAR IT! The tone in my head! I should say "tones" because this amp is versatile. I am amazed at the tonal capabilities of this amp. I am able to get great tone from this amp with all my guitars. Not just one or two that sound the best, but great tone from all my guitars. I have used it in a live rehearsal setting mic'd through the church PA system and it is gigantic. At my home studio it is now my main amp. It is fully compatible with my style. I do rock based contemporary worship music and I have a 80's hard rock edge to my playing. I really don't know if there was a style it couldn't handle. I am really impressed with Blackstar.                
All kinds of features whether you use them or not, 16 and 8 ohm outs, mp3/line in, speaker emulated outs for direct recording, 112 and 412 selector switch, on and on. They thought of everything.                
Very easy to tweak. It's standard stuff, volume, gain, treb, mid, bass, etc. But this does have a unique ISF control which allows you to get a full American 6L6ish tone all the way to a British EL34 growl or anywhere in between. Nice touch. No learning curves, just adjust this beauty to taste using simple analog knobs.                  
Very impressive build quality. Classic yet contemporary. This amp packs massive tone in it's smaller than expected package. I wouldn't have it any other way. It's slightly more compact size makes it lighter and easier to tote around.                
This is is as good as it gets today. In fact, in is one of the best values in a long time. Great, keep up the good work Blackstar!                
I hear this. I never used them. I have two Blackstar products, the great HT Dual pedal (or should I say amp in a pedal), and the crazy awesome Blackstar HT5R 112 which awes me.                
Major tone sex appeal.                 
I play everything from Blues, to Metal.  This amp will get you most anywhere you want to go.  If there is one thing I dont like, I wish it had an EQ built-in for the clean side rather than a TONE knob.  The clean sound can sound a bit thin at times, but nothing I cant work with.  I love the ISF knob.  I usually leave it on the brit side, but I do like to throw some US in there every now and then.  The ranges you can get out of this.....it is great.  From Marshall to Mesa on the gain side.  The clean side really isnt anything.  It sure isnt a Fender clean sound, but it isnt too bad.                
I love the features.  Foot controller, the ability to use headphones without hurting the amp (cant do this with most all tube amps).  The ISF sound shaping is nice.  
My problem with the features.  1)  Only a tone knob for the clean channel.  2) ISF does not change anything on the clean channel.  
I can get the clean channel to break up a bit, others are better, but overall, it is very good.                
Simple to use....if you have ever used an amp.  The instructions for using the headphones and the speaker emulator leave a little to be desired, but not hard to figure out.                
I cant say.  Had it 3 weeks and it is still working fine.                
A pretty good price for an all tube amp.                
Never had to deal with them.                
It is not a Marshall JCM or a Mesa....or a Fender, but it is nice.  It sounds very good.  The gain is the best part of the amp.                
It is a good amp at a great price.  For the price, I dont thinky ou can beat it.  This thing is a gain monster.  The gain is very nice, but it keeps the clarity.  The clean channel is a bit thin at times, but useable.  From Blues to Metal and eve rything between, it is pretty darn good.  Get one, you WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!                
This is a very versatile amp. It goes from clean to crunch to heavy distortion. I am blown away by the quality of sound. I can't imagine that you would be disappointed with this amp unless you required more volume. The high gain channel is very loud for 5 watts. If you are looking for a great tube amp that responds well to your playing, look no further. I really did my homework on this one.                 
Great that it comes with a pedal to switch channels.                
Very easy to get the sound that you want                
Fit and finish were great                
A little pricey for 5 watts but worth it.                
Have not had an issue                
Built very solid                
I would definatly buy another one if lost or stolen                
I gave it an 8 because im being realistic, a 9 or 10 is much much more expensive. In it's price range it's a 10. Blackstars logo (the sound in your head)...it's true! Takes some time but once you find your sweet spot your in like flint. No boxy sound, good bottom end. The clean channel is very nice with the volume 1/2 way. If you dime it you can start to get some crunch! Responds to pick attack very well and works great with pedals. The overdrive is a little more tricky, gonna need a soundgate, volume past 3/4 and you get some hum and feedback that's with the gain at 10. Back volume off to 1/2 and gain at 3/4 and it's glorious! That's the sweetspot for your effects too. You can use your overdrive to push the amp into the sound in your head. Buy this amp.                 
It's all here!                
A little tricky, takes time but that's part of the fun.                 
Nice!                
This is the #1 best value out there, thank you very much Blackstar and the dirt poor dude that put the thing together. Nice.                 
To soon, hope for the best.                 
It looks really good in my little area my wife allows me, sharpe looks.                 
Blackstar is doing it right.                 
I was playing through it with my Schecter (active EMGS) all night and it sounds awesome. After dialing in the right tone I am in love. Don't assume that because I play active EMGs that I am a metalhead. I love the way active pups sound for any style of playing, just my preference.                
Very versatile, has two channels, has reverb, enough said. Not sure that I can hear much difference with the 4x12 emulater vs the 1x12 standard setting. I have not messed it much though.                
Like I said, I was not sold on this amp out of the box, but after some research I got it dialed in and it sounds great.                
The material cover the front is stretched around the middle, like it was leaning on it or something. Not very noticeable though.                
Comparable price to other quality 5-15w amps, with more features                
NA                
When I first plugged in I was a little unsure whether I had made the right decision by buying this amp over the Marshall Class 5, but after splitting up my pedalboard correctly through the effects loop I am sold. I also have a Fender Vibrolux Reverb and a small traynor solid state. I wanted a small tube amp to take place of the Traynor. Also, my roommate has a Fender Blues Jr and this thing rivals that in tone, and offers so much more. I did a lot of homework on small tube amps, and this is in my opinion the best value. I chose the reverb version because I love reverb and read good reviews, the reverb is ok but does not match my vibrolux.                
I took a chance on this cabinet for my Marshall Origin 20 watt combo amp. To give it a little more bottom end and fuller bigger sound stage. It worked out very good. The Celestion 70/80 speaker delivers all of what I hoped for. Together with the Celestion V type 10" speaker in the amp I am getting the best of both sonic worlds.The cabinet itself is solidly made. I could have wished for a pine or birch finger jointed cabinet but for this price it gives me all I can expect. The cabinet is made form MDF but it's not nearly as heavy as I was expecting it to be. Well worth the price point and beyond.As always zZounds delivers all anyone could ever expect.                
I bought this amp a few months back and waited to review it so that I could be as informative as possible. First thing is that the patches are place in banks of four when you use the footswitch (optional) that to me should have been included. If you use a midi footswitch and I have one (Rocktron Midi Mate) you may assign any way you choose. There are several ways to get the most out of this amplifier. Remember what I said about patches? The first 12 patches are available to you without the footswitch! You can select them from the front panel, keeping in mind there are three banks with four patches per bank. once you select a bank you can then move left to right to get the patches. They are laid out logically, 1st patch on each bank allows for a clean sound, 2nd patch more crunch, 3rd patch more gain and so one until you get to the 4th that will allow you the most gain and effects for lead or whatever. Now you have the rundown. The patches can be changed and instantly saved to via pushing the patch location, (you can change to any of the 12 without a foot switch) until it blinks, then press again to save. If you want more control over the other 110 patches you will need the insider software. Yes there is software that you can download to unlock the amps true potential. First off once you have the installed software and the computer connected to the amp. it will show you all the patches, which can be selected and demoed at that time. you can make adjustments to taste (saving if you choose), you may move patches to an order that fits your style or needs. There is also a really cool feature that allows you to download and upload patches others or you have created. Once you find what you like, they are described by the creator with comments such as hot blues, or even Metallica clean and so on. Keep in mind that creator may not be playing the same instrument and pickups as you! You may have to try different offerings for similar descriptions. be patient, you will find something you like. If you are really patient you can create something you like. I have been playing awhile so these types of offerings do not hinder or intimidate me. I just jumped in and thought everything worked as it should. The only thing I think I should point out is that you can not drag and drop patches. I believe this is done to prevent accidental overwriting. having said that, I have 5 of these amps in different sizes a 15 watt (8-10 in SPKR) the 30 watt and 60 watt single speaker combos.(both 12s) and 2 of the 260s (2x12) I have them all programmed the same! I can take anyone out and my sound is consistent! also one more feature of these amps is the speaker out emulation, it is superb, in most cases when I go out I take 2 EV 1000 watt (active)  15 inch full range speakers and run the emulation to both! This allows me to quickly and very efficiently cover the entire stage in sound! The entire band can not only hear me, but adjust how much and where. this is a game changer! I use the source amp as a monitor as it allows you to use that amp volume separately from the emulation! and having all the amps set the same allows me the choice of any config I like and still get the sound that I need. I hope this assists you,                
I was looking for a combo that would deliver great tone, versatility, and performance for playing out and for use at practice with a drummer in the room.
I was extremely reluctant to go with this (or any modeling type of amp) over tube, as I am not a fan of digital sounding distortion tones.
I can honestly say I have never been more surprised. My initial thought was my expectations were simply lowered, but it keeps sounding great in a solo and band setting and keeps putting a smile on my face.
Review scores are in relation to other offerings in this price range. (Will this sound better than a $4,000 tube amp? No...but how does it score against other offerings in the same range?)
Tone: 10
The TVP combined with the two 12's delivers a very convincing tube feel and punch, along with tube type response to pick attack and pickup volume. My other guitarist is a notorious tone snob (more than I), and even he was impressed with the tone, volume, and presence this combo produces. Add in the ability to dial in your own pre and power tubes, and this amp can delver a wide range of useable tones...not just different, but actual tones you would want to use. Quite happy with this in the tone department. The speakers are Celestion Seventy 80's (look to be OEM for this amp judging by the magnet label), but they sound great. Plenty of low end punch, plenty of presence and they hold up well at high volumes.
Features: 8
The TVP is the star of the show, and it is fantastic at what it does. I was able to dial in a few different useable voices very quickly. The mix of EQ, Resonance (low frequencies), Presence (high frequencies), and possible combinations of pre and power tubes allow you a ton of versatility. The effects are pretty good...not outstanding, but quite decent in moderation. By far, the way to use the features is the Insider software, which allows for full control of all the features as well as patch export/import/sync to amp. You get granular control of the effects in a graphical format that mimics real pedals for ease of use.
Quality: 8
The only knock I can give on quality is the corner protectors being shiny hard plastic in feel. But really, that is a nit-pick that is easily overlooked. The quality is solid on this amp, and it looks and feels like you would expect from a great mid-priced amp.
One last thing of note - the stereo effect (especially with the new super wide stereo that is in the latest Insider firmware/software update) is very, very good. The reverb and delay especially shine here. Great sounding amp all around, with all the versatility you could ask for and enough power to play a small to medium size gig without a mains if you had to. Holds up quite well at high volumes.                
I have to be straight up. I am a former bassist, who decided at the age of 50 to learn and play guitar.  Most of the stuff I love range from Johnny Cash to Pink Floyd.  If that's not a broad enough range then throw in some CCR and Yardbirds for good measure.
I know the difference between valve and solid state.  I'm a guitar novice but I'm not daft as my Brit friends would say, and although this amp is not perfect, it's a lot of fun dialing it in to play the type of stuff I love.  For example I just opened the box and for the fun of it dialed in You Really Got Me, but within a few minutes of that also managed to dial in Led Zeppelin The Immigrant Song and Rock and Roll.
That's what I mean when I said that this amp is a lot of fun.  It gives the player (ahem) enough range to experiment and tweak their sound.  When I was in the mood for a little Man in Black, RING OF FIRE, it didn't take long to find that nice warm country sound with a little bite that song requires.
Is the amp loud?  Yes, but not so loud you will blow out your windows.  Is it a dead bang for the valve emulations?  No, but its pretty damned close, and if you don't have the funding for a half stack valve Marshall or Mesa, this is a viable option.  
I play a Stratocaster (EMG DG20s.  God knows I love my Floyd), a Taylor and most recently a Gibson Les Paul Standard, and for the first time I have to say my guitars came alive.  Coming from a Fender FM 212 to The Blackstar ID260 is like being reborn musically.   There is tremendous range and endless possibilities.
However, now for the not so flattering.  I think its bulls**t that  Blackstar forces us to spend another $89. for the foot controller.  Even Fender includes foot controllers in its Mustang line.  To really see what this amp has and is capable of the footswitch is mandatory.  Hopefully one day I will get one.
Anyway, this has been a novices review of the Blackstar ID260.  Hope it helped a little.                
I have great tube amps.  Of course you have to use pedals to customize your sound. The top is what sold me on the Blackstar.  I was skeptical but am now a believer and I’m glad I took it over the boss katana.  When you switch the tvp on it punches your sound. Then you get to choose between 6 power tubes.  I have a hearing loss all my life and the difference between the tubes is very obvious.  The reverb is is great and the other options (there is a lot) are finely done.  This is more than a practice amp.  This could be a go to or back up amp.  I got it because my less Paul studio does take quite right to my tubes.  The Blackstar will be my amp for humbuckers.  The studio has coil tapping knobs and boy this amp marks a visible line between the two settings. For me I have to be able to hear the difference for it to make sense.  If you play without the tvp distortion sounds hollow but that’s most solid states.  Just use the tvp and download the insider program to maximize the features.                  
I have played a lot of different amps over the years both tube and solid state, low end and high end. What some amps have others don't,  and when it comes to amplifiers, 99% of the time you get what you pay for. The Blackstar id260tvp is that 1% exception... This amp is seriously top notch tone. The best tone monster I have had the opportunity to own. This amp can cater to any style of player. The new EQ knobs paired with the ISF really let's you create the tone you're looking for. The TVP switch is legitimately some kind of sorcery... Tones within tones. You can have three effects running simultaneously without the online software each of which you can adjust the parameters. And to top it all off, you have it in Superwide Stereo. Hearing it in person is awesome. It's very emersive and you feel like what you're playing is around you. This amp is definitely an experience. Plenty of volume for recording and small venues sound keeps it's clarity at high volumes as well as break up at high volumes (like a classic tube would) but it depends on what you're going for. A lot of people talk mess about blackstar but they truly are great amplifiers. It is a pain in the rear that they don't include the footswitch, but in my personal opinion, this amp is worth every penny and I'm not disappointed one bit. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great amplifier that is studio, gigging, and practice ready and not a one-trick pony. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.                
I bought this Blackstar 260TVP to replace two Marshall Heads and 4x12 cabs for casino gigs. Great amp packed with features and some real usable tones. My biggest complaint was the malfunctioning drive channel after 5 months of gigs...The Korg web site is useless but, after a call found a local authorized repair facility. If it wasn't solid state I would bench it myself but, don't have that choice with the Blackstar. I will see if this repair is accurately diagnosed and fixed...I have my reservations at this point. I really dig the tone and the 60 watts stereo but, having a breakdown after 5 months of ownership is not a good omen.                
I was originally shopping for a budget tube amp when I came across this and it exceeded my expectations over all contenders.  This is everything anyone could want in a very portable and budget friendly amp.  With the FS-10 foot controller, it is a dream brought into reality.  You will swear there are tubes in it somewhere.  There is a midrange knob that is in the programming software (and it's as easy to use as turning on your computer) but I wish it were on the actual amp.                
Crystal clear & screaming distortion,all in a simple package, its easy to dial in infinite tones.                
I've had the privilege of owning a dozen tube amps over 20 years of giggin from six different manufacturer as well as four modeling amps/solid states from 4 different manufacturer...  All I can say is that,it surpasses all the modeling amps that I've own by hundreds of miles and comes extremely scary close by inches to many tube amps that I've gig with...                
very practical and to the point.....                  
no brainer... I was able to get awesome sounds really quick without the use of PC and store it! made minor tweaks during rehearsals and gig with it......                
good...  As far as reliability,I dont abuse my stuff so it should be well for years to come..                
very good considering if you would buy every amp it emulates you would have to work three jobs!                
they are always coming out with software updates and UK tech support, because its in the UK takes time. my only issue is not the amp but the software down load...
like I said,dynamics,frequency blending,touch sensitivity,responsiveness,live volume levels! its just too scary close to the real thing and so far I've had eight gigs with it and it fooled sound guys who are use to sticking a mic on tube amps! he! he!
The other wow factor is its very light weight!!!!!                
I am one to be known to get rid of gears really quick when it doesn't cut it  on two different bands that I play with! specially during a live gig where dynamics,high volume levels,frequency blending( which is  critical),touch sensitivity,responsiveness,if the amp is not happening! its getting ship back or sold... band members usually takes bets on how long I can keep some gear and laugh about it by the way.  Until they recently saw me sold almost all my tube amps and couple of modeling amps and  almost all my  pedals. I am now down to one awesome tube combo and five boss pedals. I'm not just keeping these few because they sound awesome,but because they've been with me and withstood the time of good gigs and bad gigs.  Sooooo to some it up,The Blackstar ID 60 1x12 pass all my test and its now my go to amp at all times! for gigs and rehearsals.. 
Iâ€™ve always been leery of solid state amps because of their thin, weak output. This amp totally changed my impression of solid state/non tube amps. The TVP makes this amp really Rock!! So much clean power and volume from a single 12â€ that Iâ€™m still in shockâ€¦ from clean to crunch; all the sounds are there. Since Iâ€™m a techno-geek the Insider software is fun - Limitless sounds and combinations of tones (downloadable or create your own). LOVE this amp!! The footswitch makes cycling through patches a breeze; definitely recommend.                
This amp is loud! Too loud for the living room. It really does behave like a tube amp. I have had most of them. From a pre CBS twin to a plexi. Way too many to count or remember. As far as I can tell the "feel" is there, even if the tone may not be exact. It is pretty good for me. I have waited a while to write this review as I wanted to hear it in a variety of conditions. I just recently had it on stage with about a dozen other players all playing authentic tube amps and this thing shined. The foot pedal made it a chore but the sound was fantastic. If you are seriously considering this amp remember this, you will not like it at living room levels. You really have to crank it to get the tone. And  that point is painful to the ears in a confined space (you were warned). The thirty would probably be the best choice and onei would have made if it had a dedicated "mid" knob. The effects are usable and when used in concert with the software are very tweakable. The tvp knob has provided me with hours of fun. My only complaint is the overdrive tone. It sounds like a blown speaker at low levels and is VERY annoying, and they give no options of tone shaping it. Hopefully down the road they add this option. I almost returned it because of this awful buzz like property, but once you turn it up, it is far less annoying. The amp is reasonably light and as far as tone goes, blows away the spider valve it has replaced. This amp can and will keep up in any situation.                 
Got this beauty a few weeks ago and still finding new things about it.I've had a lot of amps over the years and never thought I would ever see a solid state amp that has the sound of a tube amp. There is no need to ever turn the TVP switch off.The clean channels are fantastic and the Crunch and O.D. channels are killer. I'm still finding new and inventive ways to push this bad boy. I haven't gigged it yet and still finding new tones to add to the arsenal. I do highly recommend getting the FS- 10 footswitch for even easier access to all the sounds and FX this has to offer.                
As a new guitarist I didn't know much about amps. I was looking to sound great but also stay within and budget and this amp did just that. I wanted to avoid tubes because I wasn't familiar with maintence and proper care for them so I decided to go with a digital amp. This amps true valve power switch is amazing and really makes the amp punch, as id like to call in the button that is always on.                
The ID60 TVP is a great amp with great tones. I also purchased the foot pedal for it which makes changing channels easier. If your looking for a great amp for practice or live use you can't go wrong with this one.                 
I already own the Club 50 with 2x12 cab, the HT-5 head, and numerous Blackstar pedals. I wanted to get something that was easier to transport. I have had it one day and I think it is a great amp, especially for the name and the price! I have not used the insider software option (probably won't), but I have found the amp easy to use after the initial learning curve! I am very satisfied with my purchase!!!                
I play at a church, I run my guitar thru a line 6 helix. I go stereo thru the house mixer for the recording but for the live sound i go thru the Blackstar amp. It sounds awesome and it just cuts thru the mix. I have it at half way volume setting at it doesn’t distort in any way. I would recommend this for any guitarist playing at church.                
This is a solid amp that produces great tone. The stereo effects are impressive. Build quality appears to be good based on first impressions. It is large and heavy compared to most solid state units, which I like. You must provide your own USB cable for computer/DAW connections. The user guide is pretty basic, not written in Chinglish but definitely not published by Blackstar in the UK.I returned this amp after only a handful of short practice sessions. It died during my first attempt at using the included Blackstar Insider software. Connecting a laptop by USB cable brings up a message that a software update is available. If the update from the Internet fails for any reason, your amp becomes a large door-stop. Also note that (1) a laptop or desktop is required - no tablet or phone compatibility. (2) Windows 10 is not supported according to the Blackstar website (Windows 8 max). (3) running the software in a virtual machine environment is not recommended. I was looking forward to working with custom patches and lots of experimentation. Will not be buying anything with Internet based software again!                
I wanted a Bluetooth speaker to listen to music and thought I might as well get this to use the amp for guitar and bass. I ended up not using the amp that much as I have other amps which are more versatile. Sooo, I really just use it for the Bluetooth to play iTunes through. It sounds nice, seems well made although a bit pricey.                
This pedal does the job it was designed to do, though I believe it is overpriced.
Had they integrated a more robust tuner display into it, say something that replaces a Boss TU2 with a nice chromatic display, it would have been worth the money. As it is, you get the nearest note in the display and have to rely on the switch LED's to indicate if you are sharp or flat. The middle LED indicator is not quite sensitive enough, and you will need to use your ears to fine tune.
You can set this to adjust the effects, to directly access patches 1-4, or to navigate through all 128 patches. When you are navigation mode, you have to commit the Patch change with the far right switch. This is useful if you want to start the song on (for instance) patch 12 and switch to patch 1 during the song. Once you are on patch 12, you can click down to patch 1 - it will flash while you keep playing on patch 12, and will change to patch 1 only when you click the far right switch.
There are other features to allow you to store patches, but it's far simpler to use the Insider software or the amp front to do this. 
The use of the 1/4 cable as a link cable is nice - no expensive cable to buy if the included one gets messed up.
All in all, decently built, but in hindsight a simple midi footswitch would have gotten the job done for me at half the price considering what I use it for - direct access to patches 1-4.                
This amplifier deffinately lives up to all the great reviews regarding it's flexibility, dynamic response. The approach Blackstar took to replicate voltage interaction between amp and speaker of the various tubes as a means of reproducing the dynamics and musical harmonic texture by far surpasses any typical digital modeling system I've ever used. The depth of the stereo effects is impressive also. Panning is deep and produces a physical sense of motion. The reverbs are lush, musical and controllable. The EQ options are responsive and the ISF knob provides, what I would consider, the ideal means of controlling the character of the mid range response. The master resonance(low mid/bass response) and presence(high mid/treble) work great to allow you to switch between TVP tube simulations without having unpleasent incongruity. The only negative issue I can think of is the lack of an effects loop as I use a looper pedal and it either has to go in the front of the amp which gets muddled quickly, or in the back via the mp3 jack which doesn't accomplish matching the line level with the input level very well. The Blackstar footswitch, an extra 90 bucks, Ch1 (patch mode) has a latency issue of maybe 200 miliseconds, maybe a little more. There is less in nav mode but you have to select a bank/channel and then press the recall(4th) button to actually make the switch. There is also noise introduced when the footpedal is plugged in. I couldnt use the emulated line out with a Zoom h1 recorder because of the ticking produced by the footpedal.                
Totally worth the price. No nonsense quick control. no special cables. The 3 modes are handy being able to select a spec. program and switch to manual mode and turn individual fx on and off.                
I’ve been playin on this little amp about a month now and I absolutely love it. It’s as loud as it needs to be for bedroom practicing and the delay works good. Getting pretty decent tone out of it also.                
I got this amp from zZounds using their payment plan.  Really put it within reach for me. 
At first I was ok with the amp, it was very nice but their were some things about the tone that wasn't doing it for me.  Then...  I found out it has external bias adjustments, (meaning you don't have to drop the head from the combo to get to the adjustment screws. to Bias the output tubes) They even included a green and red LED for each adjustment, so you don't need any special equipment to do this.  
I set the balance adjustment (the hole closest to the tubes) so both LEDS are out.  Then I adjusted the drive (the hole further from the tubes). On this adjustment the LEDS tell you Cool -(green) and Hot - (red). I took it into the red then backed off just enough for the red LED to go out.  So it was at the top of the range.   It made this amp come alive.  I was totally blown away.  It has been about 3 months since I did this and I'm still loving the tone.  I have Fat / Thick cleans, nice 1/2 distorted for playing rhythm, then super saturated for getting heavy and shredding leads.  For pedals, I only use a sonic maximizer and my Wah pedal. Nothing else is needed.   
Another featured that I figured would suck, but doesn't, is the Line Out with 4x12 or 1x12 simulation modes.  I have NEVER (i mean Never) had a direct out that was usable in any way.  This one is beyond usable, it actually sounds very nice. I blend it with the 2 mics I put on it , (Cascade Fat Head II ribbon and a MD421) and get a great sound. 
Anyway, if you're at least a little bit handy, it's pretty easy to dial in this amp.  BTW, I'm using an '83 American Stratocaster with 1 SD Hot Rail and the 2 stock single coils that came in it.  Hot rail for distortion, and the single coils for clean playing.  
I have finally found a Combo that I can use for playing-out, and not feel like I'm compromising.
My Big rig is a rack system with ADA preamp, Mesa Boogie 50/50 and 2 Marshal 4x12's.  And after 25 years, I think I may be able to stop using.                
This amp is an incredible value. Yes it's made it China. What isn't anymore. The only negative thing i have to say about the amp is the crappy 2 button footswitch that comes with it. I HIGHLY recommend getting the 5 button footswitch....if you can find one. I got my amp from zZounds....awesome company and service....but they did not have the 5 button footswitch which adds a whole new level of flexibility to the amp. I had to wait on a 30 day back order for the FSW. It was worth the wait. The option to switch the voices on and off on each channel is really cool. The tone of this amp is really incredible. The clean channel can do Fender or switch to a more gritty tone like an old VOX or Marshall. The 1st OD channel picks up from there with nice gritty Plexi like tones all the way up JCM 800 chunk. Kick in the voice and you've got even more gain and top end. The 2nd OD channel sounds best to me with voice left on. It's kind of muddy sounding without it and the channels share the EQ so that's a bit of a drawback but I can live with that. I set that channel up for soloing and leave it that way. The cabinet voiced direct out sounds great and you can choose different cab sims. i use the 4x12. I use it live as well as miking and my tone is fat and thick as thieves I use FX but I only use the amp for distortion. I'm using a Digitech RP1000 for FX and I play a USA Fender Elite Strat as well as a couple of Shecters. I bought every piece of gear I own from zZounds.through their payment plan.It's a great company and their the only ones that offer a no credit check payment plan with no interest. Pay your bill on time and they increase your limit and give you more time. How cool is that for a poor working musician? Overall you can't go wrong with this amp. I shaved a couple of stars off features because I think the full function foot switch should come with the amp It's another $80.                
I bought this amp used but was in great shape still had stickers on it. Wasn't long till the tubes went out. I replaced them and after a year and a half the thing quit working all together. I've had tube amps before. A couple of Fenders and an Ampeg. Never problems like these so early on. Then to top it off it's hard to find anyone to work on these things. I'll never by another and will be selling this one if I can get it fixed. Total junk and lousy customer support.                
Blackstar has raised the bar on bass combo amps. The construction is second to none, and it's loaded with effects that leave all the other manufacturers in the dust. Good luck Ampeg and Fender. You guys better think of something fast, because Blackstar is the one to beat now.                
Very transparent sound. Rich detail and low noise.                
standard pre-amp features: phantom power/padding/phase on/off for each channel and 2x 1/4 TRS output                
Minutes to power up and get recording. very simple and straight forward                
solid metal case and dials/switches also seem very sturdy.                
The level of detail this brings out in recordings is very much worth every penny spent on this device.                
N/A                
I wasn't aware how much nicer recordings could sound with such a simple upgrade as a mic pre-amp.                
I tested out this new pre-amp by comparing it with my current setup. I have been using the internal pre's on the Scarlett 6i6 for about 3 years for miking guitar amps with a SM57, e609 or Octavia MK-319 and been very pleased. Recently I found myself needing to record from 4 microphones at the same time. Adding the Auteur MKII to my setup was suggested as a way i could accomplish this task. The MKII was quick to setup, one external AC adapter and 2 1/4" TRS cables to plug it into my 6i6 and I was ready to go. I tested it head-to-head with the internal pre's on the 6i6 using 2 octavia MK-319's, one plugged into the 6i6 and one into the MKII. The source material was an acoustic Yamaha baby grand piano. Both microphones were placed next to each other. Comparing the recording from the MKII to the 6i6 is pretty eye opening. While the pre's on the 6i6 are very quiet the MKII is a lot quieter, and this quietness seems to translate to more detail. I play piano with the sustain pedal down constantly and the MKII resolved all the resonant frequencies wonderfully. It also brought immense clarity to the decay of each note. I've been so happy with the 6i6 that I went into this comparison thinking I would have to listen very closely to hear a difference between these two pre-amps. The extra detail and space that the Auteur MKII brings to recording is going to make it my default pre-amp going forward.                
I have been using this preamp for just about a month now and it has surpassed my expectations. My only complaint is the silly wall wart power supply, but I guess if they are going to skimp on something to keep it affordable that isn't the worst place to do so. Everything else sounds, looks and feels great!
I have had no issues with the preamp but I have done business directly with BLA before and they are a great company who are willing to go above and beyond to help.                
I am very pleased with the sound of this little preamp. For the price it cannot, I repeat, cannot be beat. Most neve 1073s sound a little different in their own right. And this little guy has some great character of its own. Clean top end but warm, and big warm lo end too. And the built in DI sounds pretty good too. Definitely better than anything I've heard in the price range. I've worked with Neve hear, Api, Universal Audio, etc. and this unit hold its own right next to all the great pieces of gear.. I'm actually going to purchase a second one to have a stereo pair :)                
Let it warm up. I`ll turn it on and go do something else for a while.                
I actually LIKE the stepped gain. Makes recalling a breeze, and the way the steps are set are just right.                
You just need to work the line level of your interface with the output of the B173.                
Built like a brick. Heavier than expected.                
It is pricier than items like the GAP, but well worth it. This unit really sounds professional.                
No problems yet.                
The sound(in combination with Antelope converters), is extremely professional sounding. Ready for the radio.                
After reading some hoopla about it being "noisy", I was a little skeptical..But the tracks people were posting sounded beautiful! I picked this over the Golden Age and never looked back. It sounds a LOT more expensive than it is. The instructions say to let it warm up for a few minutes, but I`ve found after using it, around an hour and it`s gets even better. I`m using it into an Antelope Zen for the vocal channel. Incredible combo. The B173 sounds twice the price.                
You can't crank the gain on this preamp too much with out affecting distortion. Keep the gain low and the output ay about 3 o'clock for good sound.                
I'm not a musician, so I have no use for the D/I, or the crunchy output potential.                
Depending on your voice quality, you'll need to adjust the countless permutations of levels going in and coming our of each device to get optimal sound. After a few hours, it's easy to get a feel for proper settings.                
Nice feel to the knobs, with good solid clicks with each turn.                
Yep. Zzounds gave me the best price on this baby!                
No communication with company thus far.                
It's overall quality can be measured in it's warm sound. That's all that matters.                
My BL B173 is linked to a Tascam UH-7000 (interface setting only) and sounds rich, textured and warm. The Tascam preamp alone is super-clean, but slightly thin. The B173 added to the audio chain is perfect for my resonant voice.                
This box is AWESOME! There was an immediate, noticeable improvement in my tracks right outa the box! I had no idea how important a good clock is to the quality of the audio.I have more depth, width, and detail. I don't even have a lot of digital gear. I just hooked the Micro Clock up to my digital mixer, and that's it! I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this product!                
Just got this in today, yeah yeah yeah , its not the latest and greatest, but clocking my motu828es to 44.1 listening back to a session recorded on another interface, The harshness is gone, its the equivalent to being blurry eyed from a pool with extra chlorine then going to a 4K viewI can hear details in my mix, that before where smearedReady to start tracking with the updated setupIt just works, no frills, just does the job!                
Just do it!!!   Really I am astounded at the difference in my tracks. Open detailed, seems to have more content.                 
Black Lion is a small company that builds exceptional value into their audio product line, at bargain prices. They also specialize in custom modification of some audio equipment made by other manufacturers. The Micro Clock MKII is no exception. Using it as a 'master' clock in the studio, has enabled me to record at higher sample rates, with more confidence, knowing that the recorded sound source is continually and more faithfully reproduced at playback, without added 'artifacts,' that sometimes occur in the digital conversion process. I am told that there is an added benefit to using the micro clock that 'opens or, widens' the audible stereo field. What I know is it sounds no worse (and that is saying something, whenever adding additional units in an electronic audio chain) and it very well may improve the quality of sound. If you are linking more than one digital device in your studio, I believe you will benefit from purchasing a Black Lion Micro Clock MKII as the master timing source. Play good and mix well.                
Blackbird pedalboards are probably the best value for this type of board. I wanted a board that had a more boutique quality without the boutique price and it fits perfectly. The design is smart and practical, the ATA case is very high-quality, and it looks nice and clean. I love having the 1/4" jacks on the side, and the design allows a lot of customization. The only problem I've had is that cutting your own cables is a must with a board like this. Not an issue for me, as I prefer this way, but cable management can be difficult with boards that don't have much by way of routing underneath the board. However, pedal placement is only limited to how much you can fit on the board and the lack of holes or slits leaves no empty space and pedal placement is exactly how I like it.
Great product!                
I really like this pedalboard.  The road case is tough with padding inside to protect your pedals.  The latches are sturdy and lock it tight.  I needed to grab a smaller board to replace my very much loved SKB PS-45 pedalboard but it was time for me to upgrade so I chose this.  Another thank you to zZounds for their play as you pay plans.                
What else can I say except I'm having no issues with my purchase of my Blue Baby Bottle SL Cardioid Condenser microphone. It performs just fine in and around my sound studio. Would purchase a second and a third one in good time and do recommend to both friends in the industry and other new and up coming music producers alike. A great microphone and great value.                
I really like Blue BabyBottle SL, one reason is the sensitivity level. This mic can hear!
Also the presence on vocals is outstanding!                
I got these on the buy one get one free sale. One of them was defective and did not work. The other was fine. I used it on guitar and it sounded great. I have to return the other, hopefully they will not be the kind of mics you can't look at without jacking up.                
I've had a history with Blue Microphones, and this one did not disappoint. The price point is fair for almost any home studio budget, and the sound quality cannot be matched at that price. Would recommend for anybody looking to record alto male vocals, female vocals, or acoustic guitar.                
I have a stedman pro screen XL pop filter. I used to have the original Blue Spark and it was good no problems but even with my $50 pop filter there are still plosives on the SL version you definitely need a nylon pop filter. As for the sound its a bit harsh and grainy buy you get what you pay for.                
Zzounds sold me the Bose All I can say is wooow The L1 is great..Support  from Zzound and Bose .com are great ..They help setup my system up and any addons..all the heavy speakers are in the past..Go in setup in a flash..You will love them....sooner or later we all get older these things are a no pole speaker and lighter                
It Sounds good but I think you must use at least 4 to get a deeper bass sound.                
Just because is small and looks great, and works with the L1 systems from Bose.                
Just plug it and turn up the volume, and that's it.                
Well Done.                
It Worth the price but you have to spend $1300.00 to use 4 and get that real bass sound.                
I don't need it yet.                
I own it!                
I don't know yet.                
first of all my experience with z z sound has been great. I have several Bose system, after purchasing the Bose b2 base module. it has taken my bose compac L1 one system to another level of sound for portable system. if you are familiar with Bose sound system you know  It's a sound like no other. I am a karaoke and video DJ in the Greater Cleveland area.                
BOSE B2 IS VERY EASY TO USE "10" IT IS A PERFECT IMPACT OF BEAT TO THE DANCE FLOOR!!! "10"  I REALLY RECOMMEND AND A MUST HAVE BASS FOR YOUR L1 SPEAKERS!!! I RATED THIS PRODUCTS "10"!!!  SOUNDS SUPER GREAT SOUNDS AND VERY CLEAR, CLEAN AND PROFESSIONAL!!! NOW IT'S TIME TO UP GRADE YOUR SOUND SYSTEMS TO L1 BOSE B2 MODULE!!!  WHY WORK HARD WITH BIG SPEAKERS? TIME TO WORK SMART WITH PROFESSIONAL SMART SPEAKERS!!!!!                  
use this to dj love the sound and no more busting my back lifting 18 inch sub                 
Not quite sure what I expected from these speakers, but I certainly didn't expect this:
*Excellent bass
*Decent highs
*Comparable to a super-sized BOSE SOUNDLINK MINI ii
Due to their compact size, I was completely suprised at the overall performance of these  speakers. A definite WOW FACTOR! With the convienent payment options and super fast  (and free) shipping from zZounds, this was one of the most hassle free purchases I have made on line!
I bought these because of the Bose Name. When I hooked them up, which by the way is so easy, the sound wowed me! True sound that really fills the entire room. No matter where in the room I am the sound is the same as if I'm sitting in front of them. The bass is as it should be, pounding. The highs and mids are great. 1 would at first look say no way could these speakers for their size deliver such incredible sound. But they do indeed surpass all expectations. Volume control is just a simple twist of the pod wheel. It has hookups for headphones and another audio device. But I have no need for them as of yet. I use these for all of my laptop uses. News, Videos, Music, and most of all my DAW programs. I should of bought these sooner, had I known how good they really sound. And what makes this so affordable is the 4 monthly payments that zzounds offers. Have not needed manufacturer support. But do register them at the Bose website. All in all a best buy and worth every penny.                
I'm very pleased with this purchase. I've owned them for 22 days now and feel as if I've had them for a longer time. The small speakers pack a very grand punch, sounding like larger sized traditional speakers.                
I would highly recommend these speakers. They are small enough for travel and give you just enough extra sound to really enjoy whatever it is you want to listen to.                 
I would Like to be able to write a positive review. However I was never able to try the speakers out as the cables connecting the unit were to short yo place where i wanted them. Contacted Bose & they said there was no cable available to move speakers farther apart. Would suggest this would be a good feature.                
I Purchaced The Bose L1 Model 1S with two B1 Bass Modules. The Sound Is Absolutely Awesome!! My Outside Shows Require A Little More Punch In The Bass. I Bought The Bose A1 Packlite Extended Bass Package And That Took Care Of That. As A Mobile DJ/KJ , I appreciate The Light Weight System That Can Produce High Volume Sounds And, With The Help Of The Tone-Match Engine, Keep The Tone Clear And Crisp. These Extension Packages Can Easily Be Daisy Chained For Even More Bass Punch!! I Will Definitely Buy Another One!!                
All I can say is wow!!!! I have ran all QSC powered including KW 181 and 152. I have Han two of the Bose L1 model 2 b2 subs and they did sound good but when I heard this dude it blew me away. I just bought one F1 will be adding another one. then I add the subs they are loud and smooth. The 12 inch bass sound good at low volume but when you turn it to 12 o'clock the bass is still deep and rich. Get one more, you  may not need subs but I love it you will feel it in your chest!!!!!!!                
I'm a singer songwriter that does solo acoustic gigs with tracks, My go to was the L1 for the past two years, i needed more low end, had QSC K10, which made me realize i needed more bottom end for my tracks, I wasnt so happy about the QSC. i ordered this F1 812 a couple of times, and cancelled the order, thinking its a front of house speaker, not a L1 behind the performer...welll. i'm here to tell you, Thats how i use it now, behind me about 2-3 feet, I've had it for a week, and every venue i've played in, i've had other musicians come up to see what the heck was coming out behind me, it sounded perfect, it had low end, it had high end, it sounded like there was a speaker at someones table 80ft away, and doing that without blowing the front tables next to stage out. 
This is an amazing speaker, I love it, NOW i want another one, I dont need the sub, but will probably get it for even bigger and better situations. 
As one musician said to me, you've now stepped up your game, you sound so pro now.  (this guy always says negative things, never compliments), 
The only negative is, they did not provide a slip cover for this, and after 2 uses it had scratches on the cabinet...not cool Bose, 1200 bucks and you cant provide a little bit of nylon wrap to protect it?????  But now i have to pay $139 in Jan 2016 to get one...                
Okay..got ..ordered this from ZZounds last week..it arrived in 24 hrs and I didn't even ask for rush delivery..got it out of the box..it worked ..Played a gig with it last night...I only had funds for the 812 speaker..want to get the sub to go with it because I heard it in a local music store and it is awesome..With that said, last night I used it on a speaker stand with my L1 B2 base on the other side...ran a line from my tone match to the 812...was playing with a small group..we do jazz & R&B..this thing impressed me..I was totally in awe of the sound...granted I had the sub on the L1 B2, but the 812 speaker itself was more than enough to fill the room,  which had a capacity of about 300 people....Many compliments on the sound from the folks in the crowd as well as the other musicians...I'm really glad I got this thing..if you need there extra head room for your performances this thing will do the job just fine..Add the sub and you'll REALLY get big sound, but for a good quality full rand PA, the 812 is very impressive...In full disclosure, as I mentioned, I did use my Bose Tone match mixer, which I'm sure contributed to the quality of the sound, but obviously any mixer would work and probably sound just as good..the Tone Match is just what I prefer to use..                
Really impressed by the full sound and the sharp vocals, This speaker truly reproduces the sound of the music, I have not cranked these up yet and nor will I likely, these speakers are ideal for a small venue such as a wedding, or church service, I was most impressed by the dynamics of this speaker at low volumes, and when I turned it up, it was remarkable that the sound was loud and absolutely smooth. When I started as a DJ I started with the BOSE 901's and then the 802's Music evolved and I went to folded horn designs from Klipsh, JBL, and Peavey, as horn speakers got smaller I have been favoring Peavey, and recently I have switched to powered speakers by EV, wanting to expand upon this I ventured back to Bose, and just as the BOSE 901's excited me all those years ago, I find myself once again elated by the sound of the BOSE F! 812!!!                
The sound is unbelievable. I could use it by itself and get great sound and great bass. But to use it with the F 1 sub is totally amazing                
High are so crisp they could cut, with a mid range punch that is amazing. Overall the sound from this cabinet is amazing. However at $1200, Bose should have provided a cover for free                
There is no way to simply describe just how good this speaker is. Whether as FOH with full bands or behind a solo/acoustic act in a small room, the F1 blows away everything else I have used in my 4000+ show career. Did a solo gig with it 2 feet behind my left shoulder at a pretty large bar venue last night and had nonstop compliments on the sound.The adjustable vertical dispersion is surprisingly effective and useful. The headroom and clarity are astounding. The frequency response, while typically high on the bright end like all Bose products, is rounded out by the 12" woofer. The horizontal pattern is wide enough, but tight enough to reject feedback even when using behind performers. Handles and works like a traditional active speaker, and projects forward better overall than the wider dispersion tower systems.I still have QSC, Fender and other systems in my arsenal but the F1 is my new standard go-to speaker.
I knocked off 1/2 a star on features as I feel there should be a way to lock the adjustable speakers for carrying/transport...otherwise, no complaints.                
This blows everything in it's class away. I have tested just about all of them This stood out. I purchases one speaker and one sub and planning on matching that when I get this set paid off It's worth every cent                
I really don't want you to sound as good as I do but I just have to rave about the new Bose F1. I am already a Bose L1 user. This knocks it out of the park. One unit does the job of 5 separate units. Wish it had an extra XLR input, but it's an easy workaround with a splitter. Great sound for my particular voice range and my music. DJ's might be advised to buy the sub bass, but for me it's perfect. You will need to buy an expensive case if you travel, as it is easily dented. (Just like the L1) All in all a great buy for a small club or singer/ songwriter.                
Disclaimer** I do not work for or get paid by Bose, this is my unbiased review**
Over the last 15 years, I have owned most brands of top speakers from inexpensive to high-end. This is my first Bose speaker purchase ever. 
 With the Bose F1 being a linear powered speaker, expectations were met with high's clear and a long sound headroom. I used the pair of F1's first time last week with 2 separate weddings. 
First wedding had 120 guests in a 3k s.f. room with F1 tops on regular speaker tripod poles placed 30ft. apart from each other. Music playlist: hip-hop. Volume setting on Bose F1 only at 50%, seven hours later, not once clipped, only needed one 18" powered bass cube to help with the 12" speakers that are built in the Bose F1. Noticed immediately that across room at 60ft sound level was still right and had maybe another 30ft. of throw with minimal distortion! Was a little concerned breaking the 12" speaker in, playing hip-hop for most of seven hours. The F1's easily made it seven hours without a single clip. Not one guest asked to turn up the volume. 
Second wedding, next day, 90 people, 1k s.f. room. seven hours, F1 tops only on regular pole type speaker tripods. Set-up 40ft. apart in corners of room angled 90 degrees between walls that made corner. Music playlist was 60's-2000's dance music. Volume on speaker was 50%, no bass cube or extra speaker needed for a room this size! Again, did not clip. 
Final words, great speaker, construction build, and value. Only thing I would like to see changed is the handle design. I know it's hard to place handles in a box crammed with speakers and amps, but for a mobile wedding DJ, it takes a few times to figure good "lift" points, trying not to drop it when lifting on a pole mount above your head. Not the easiest to do unless you place one hand on the front grill in corner only. If you try to lift in middle of grill, the entire middle grill pushes in and I didn't want to take chance of breaking that. Only concern now is how the front grill corners will look after this wedding season. And maybe Bose partner with road case company because I can't find hard cases for the F1's, still using boxes they were shipped in as my cases until I make some later on.                 
I used to swear by my qsc k12s. I already owned four of the F1 subs so when these went on sale l bought two. These F1 tops left my k12s in the dust. I am going to buy two more as soon as funds become available.                
The Bose F1 is simply incredible, it was alot of money for me so I took my time ready reviews, ect. Finally decided to get the them with the sub, awesome...                
These speakers are by far one of if not the best compact small to medium venue, portable sound system you can buy. The sound  is superb and the amount of power that this system churns out is breath taking!  The subs are even designed to interlock with another sub for additional reinforcement. Definitely worth buying a second set.                
I bought this thing for my tv room! I use it for mixing from cdj's - streaming from iphone, whatever I want - I also use to watch movies - this is the only speaker you ever need it -                
Wow!!! What can I say?? Bose you have done it again!!! I am very very impressed with my new system!! And would highly recommend anyone to get it!! Will be ordering another set soon!!                
Perfection.  Life like reproduction,  with excellent vocal clarity.                
Variety of in/outputs is nice.  Adjustable array is a plus.                
No learning curve at all, it sounds great and is simple to use.  If you have been using Bose in the past, this will impress you even more.                
Well made, but I would like the finish on the cabinet to be scuf resistant.  I think it will look well used in a month more of gigging.  It should ship with at least a protective cover.  My only complaint so far.                
It is getting me gigs and impressing people with a wow factor,  worth the price.                
No need to as of yet.                
It lets people hear what you are actually playing.  This speaker is like finally seeing clearly.  Like if you needed glasses but didn't know it.  Then you put them on and say "wow"   JBL can't do that.                
I own the Bose L1 compact and have been gigging with it for about six months with my mostly solo Americana style act(guitar, vocals, harmonica) as well as sometimes hosting jams with multiple musicians.  It was perfect for small venues, but when I got a gig at a larger venue (large hall) my compact could not fill the room.  I was hoping that adding the F1 812 would five me the power I needed to accept larger venue gigs.  I was also hoping to continue using my L1 compact on one side as a monitor and fill.  Well, it does the job perfectly. I ran the T1 tonematch into the F1 via the XLR input, then I daisy chained from the F1 to my compact via xlr to 1/4" TRTRS.The tonality of both systems matches perfectly... Still that clean Bose sound,  even fuller as I feel the F1 fills in the mids. I play the same large hall with this system and i have to say it absolutely fills the place with even clean sound.  I get compliments and genuine amazement from the audience at the purity of the sound.  Most recent comment was, "I think this is the first time I have listened to a system where the acoustic guitar actually sounds like an acoustic guitar."  I have other musicians trying to buy it off of me, but I am keeping it.  I now have a system that opens many more opportunities.  It excedes my expectations.                  
Amazing, as stated in original review. Absolutely amazing!                
I wouldn't say any of the features were least useful. All features have a distinct function, and make very distinct differences.                
Incredibly easy to get sound, plug and play easy! They have a variety of input options making them very versatile.                
This has been the only issue so far. Not many reviews out there on these. But I did have something happen to the input section of both inputs simultaneously. Working with customer service to get a new one.                
Based on how they sound and the versatility, they are at least worth most of the asking price. If I have more issues I will say no. Otherwise, yes. They are worth the asking price.                
Haven't used.                
The appeal is very high. Everyone's asks about them, and I'm always happy to show them off                
In 1 word, amazing. These things sound great in any application. I have only had the pair for a month and a half so far and I have had the pleasure of using them for many different applications. I have used them as my home theater, lined a Mic straight in and used them for presentations, I have dj'd at a bar and used them as my front of house for my band. They handle everything I throw at them with absolutely no issues. I have never had to turn them up past noon, and that would have been way to much for many of the uses I have for them. These will easily work for med to small bar gigs. They are quality built and you can clearly hear the difference as the amp adjusts to accommodate the flexible portion of the speakers. As well as when adding subs and utilizing the full range/with sub portion of the eq. The only issues I have had so far has been concerning the input 1 and 2. Something internally came loose and both inputs stopped sending a signal to the speakers. This, however, means that I now have to deal with zzounds customer service. And let me tell you about this experience so far, and this is actually what drove me to write this review in the first place....wow! When I called zzounds, it didn't even ring once and someone answered! They asked how they could help, and then when I told him what was wrong and the product I had just recently purchased, he asked if he was speaking with xxxxxxx and stated my name, and I hadn't even told him who I was. Based on what I told him, he was able to figure out who I was, what my email address was and confirmed within 3 min of being on the phone that I should get an email with everything I needed to return the defective speaker. He then proceeded to to thank me and my phone buzzed before I was even off the phone with the email he said I would get.....this is hands down the best purchasing experience I have ever had even if I got a defective product, assuming the new replacement shows up just as fast as the original did, which I'm sure it will!                
What can be said about BOSE?  You get what you pay for.  I am a wedding DJ and went through Mackie, Behringer, QVC, EV....even had an HK line array system.  Always looking for better and more portable.  As a mobile DJ I love being able to set up and tear down quickly.  My last rig was an L1 Model 1 with a 2B bass.  I was going to move up to an L1 Model 2 with dual 2B bass cabs, but the F1 came out.  The sound is AMAZING. I have ran this thing just on the edge of clipping for hours and it is so nice. Frank Sinatra at lower levels is superb and Usher maxed out is just as good. I bought two of these. The tops and bottoms, so close to 5K invested. One set is perfect for most every wedding, I bring both sets out for school dances and such. However, two sets, even pushing 4,000 watts can pretty easily get lost in a gym full of students. I am going to set them up higher at my next one. I have been asked to "turn it up" at a prom...but for weddings.....one set is so perfect. And you never really blast anyone out so bad that the venue is telling you to turn it down. And maxed out, it is CRYSTAL CLEAR. If you need to pound your dance floor into the ground, you may be better off with something more traditional...some 15's pole mounted on a pair of nasty subs.  But if QUALITY of sound is more important, you cannot go wrong with BOSE!!                
Overall these things are amazing right out of the box, even with out subs, the lows are decent. Going to add the subs very soon to go with! Worth every penny!                
I've been using the Bose L1 system for the past 2 years. Great DJ system. I decided to get the F series. I hooked it up , turned on the mixer, hit play, couldn't hear much. I turned up the volume on the speaker, then the trim level, then the master out level and the slider level.....i mean way up to equal the same volume as the L1 system. I'm NOT impressed with this F series at all. Your much better off getting the L1S1 system if you want a GREAT Bose unit.                
I purchased one 812 and 1 sub a little over a year ago for our church and I love them the sound is superior and setup is easy. We don't move them often but when I have to I love that they're super light and easy to set up. I was able to do away with all of our monitors and our platform is clutter-free and everybody can hear themselves. I'll be buying the other pair this year..                
Bose is known for quality and they didn't skip a beat on this one. Superb sound and quality. The best part of this whole transaction was the Distributor zZounds excellent customer service. I ordered the Subs on the weekend and expected delivery on their famous free 2-day shipping by the following Wednesday. Well, there was a communication breakdown at the distributor and the Subs didn't ship on Monday. I called to check on the subs because I needed them for a gig on Thursday. After expressing my discernment with the delay, David at zZounds understood my frustration and offered a satisfactory solution to the delivery issue. All I can say is that zZounds understands working musicians and our need for equipment when we need it! Congratulations zZounds!!! You have a loyal customer for life! Thank you and God bless you all!                
It's awesome never heard bass that deep and that powerful in a speaker that small                
Unparalleled sound from a sub of this size. The lows are so deep that you could never see the Sun. Definitely a system to get for small to medium venues.

The subwoofer does what it says it will do. Nice woofer for the price.The F series isn't one of Bose best systems.                
I have to admit, when it showed up and I saw how small it was I didn't think it would be loud enough. I play in an acoustic duo and my gig last night was at a bar that is legendary for being loud. For some reason,  the way the bar is set up, the patron' s talking volume gets very loud. Smaller PA systems I've tried to use struggle to combat the volume of the people there "yell talking" to each other haha. I've used bulky behringer 15" eurolive speakers and they work well there. I was tired of lugging around heavy speakers and stands. Trying to find a power source to plug both in etc...This bose l1 compact BLEW ME AWAY! I couldn't believe how well it filled the room with volume. We cranked it to an unbearable volume to just see if it would clip. We never got to the red clipping light. Had to back it off. We played in a noisy bar with around 40 to 50 people and the sound was great. It was crisp and clear no matter where you were sitting. It's almost as if the sound surrounds you. Unbelievable what this thing can accomplish for being so small. I needed 3 channels so I ran the right side output of my mixer to the right side line level 1/4 inch input of the L1. I panned all channels to the right. Ran the mixer main at noon and the L1 at around 11 o clock. It was perfect. At one point we ran mixer main to 3 o clock and L1 to 3 o clock. Not even a little blip of red on the "clip o meter". Hands down best desision to buy this.  Love it.                 
The Bose L1 Compact was purchased as a backup to my Bose L1 Model 1's I use for professional Dj use. It is lightweight and blends in with the decor.  It has ample power to keep up with it's big brother and is an awesome addition to my already amazing setup! Extremely portable and can be run off a A/C powerpack for remote sound. I have been a professional mobile Dj for 20+ years and this is the most clear and lightweight speaker in it's class! I really like it!!                
I have a room full of all kinds of different PA systems that I have purchased over the years. Now I am looking to sell most of it since I purchased the Bose L1 Compact PA System. None of the PA's come close to the sound quality that is produced by the Bose. Why pick up all those heavy PA's that I have when the Bose sounds better, easier to set up and is much lighter. I would advise anyone to purchase this PA.                
Super clean sound and no feed back! I run it with my Roland AC-60 for killer stereo. Much easier and versatile than the Tonematch engine. I can control the effects separately for vocals and guitar and mute all from the Boss foot switches hooked to the Roland. For a duo you would want two of them especially for high volume hard singing. I chose the L1 Compact over the Fishman 220 because of the 180 degree dispersion and lack of feedback annoyances. I play the ski resort hotels and it is perfect for about 100 people. Looks great too!!                
Love it!! Quality sound. As saying goes: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. The BOSE L1 is absolutely a keeper. I use itmy smart T.V. to enhance the sound or when I am just listening to music from the TV music channel or from the Ipad great sound. I plug in my electric acoustic guitar, karaoke and enjoy numerous nights of fun for the family/friends. Thanks ZZsounds for msking this a painless purchase. My next purchase will be the Bose microphone accessory kit. Watch out now. ..                
I regularly perform on the street and do small venue performing at coffee houses, parties, worship and others. I use it mostly with an acoustic guitar, vocal mic, and loop pedal. I am really impressed with the output of this small system. I recently used it at a park when we were doing an outreach event. I used it to perform music outside for a large crowd, using a portable power source it lasted me 3+ hours and could have probably ran for at least another hour. Because I use a loop pedal I was initially really worried about feedback and sound bleeding into the mic because the L1 was behind me, but I have had no issues with it. I have gotten lots of great feedback about the sound quality.                
A buddy of mine brought one over for a backyard party. After listening to it outside, I was pretty amazed at how much crystal clear sound came out of this. We did some Karaoke and played a lot of MP3's. And helping him break it down and carry it to his car trunk, I was sold. Ordered mine the day after. Would I use this for a huge gig? Well most likely "no", but for smaller venues, this thing puts out more than enough sound and again, if the source is good, the sound is good. This thing is amazingly true and crystal clear, even at louder volumes. I am still pretty amazed at this system. I did not buy the Bose mixer, I just used a Behringer 1202FX, out the 1/4" mains and into the 1/8" "ipod" jack. Works like a champ..                
I bought two L1 portables as stereo keyboard loud speakers. What amazes me is the accuracy of the sound reproduced by these speakers compaired to conventional PA speakers. I would put it on par more or less with the sound produced by studio monitors but at louder sound levels. What is even more amazing it how the speakers throw the sound around and make it seem as if its coming from everywhere, even when the speakers are turned away from you. What I've discovered with these things is that the volume is not so important as the sound seems to magically travel long distances. The sound color also remains the same no matter what distance you are from it. The only thing bad thing I see with these loud speakers is a certain boomyness in the mid low section, somethng that I was able to fix with a little eq.                
Bose uses plastic for these entry level PAs. Their other models use metal. But they seem to be well made and sturdy nonetheless.                
$899 for this kind of amazing sound in a compact and elegant design, not to mention the sound which is the most important is worth every penny. I dont think anything out there compares with these compacts.                
The sound is fantastic. It's clean and loud and sounds the same no matter where you're standing or sitting in the room. Unbelievable!                
I love how simple this system is. I only wish I had the ToneMatch accessory to go with it as I could then adjust the volume without have to get up or bend over. And that will also allow me to add some reverb as well.                
Simple and COMPACT. This thing effortlessly fits in the trunk of my Yaris with my guitar and luggage.                
I wish it was cheaper, but you get what you pay for! This is still a good deal compared to what it would cost to get anything comparable.                
This system makes people's jaw drop. They cannot believe that much sound is coming out of that little array. It's hard to stay humble about it.                
I love it. I plan to buy the ToneMatch accessory and use it to chain a second L1 Compact for even larger venues. Although this unit is PERFECT for any coffeehouse, restaurant, or venue seating less than 100.                
I make my living as a singer/songwriter guitarist and vocalist in the Pittsburgh PA area. I bought this in Dec 2016. As of this review I've used the Compact for 21 performances. Initially it sounded bass-y and scooped (lacking mids) to my ears. The highs and lows ring beautifully but in certain venues I miss the mids. I've been using a Fishman SA220 since 2013 with great success. It is a fantastic system and probably the best value in its class considering, price, tone, easy setup/tear down, and built in features. The Fishman SA also has a very well balanced and warm tone. However, in late 2015 I had to send the control panel of the SA back to Fishman to be serviced. Channel one cut out during a performance. Turns out, in my experience that the control panel in the SA220 has a somewhat recurring issue with dirty pots that need to be cleared with compressed air occasionally. Anyway, that is what led me to try the Bose Compact. As a minimalist, I absolutely love the simplicity of the L1 Compact. It is a very straight forward system without any bells and whistles in the EQ/Effects dept. I’ve been very used to the tone of the Fishman after using it for so long, so I’ve been considering sending the L1 back to zZounds but I have finally come to terms with this realization: Although they sound very different, both the Bose L1 Compact and the Fishman SA220 are exceptional systems for a solo performer. The dispersion of sound produced by the L1 Compact is truly amazing. I've used it in large rooms, small rooms, some with tiles floors some with carpeting. It does really well every time. I've used a Strat, Taylor T5Z, and a Martin through it and they all sound great. If more EQ than what your guitar offers or having on-board effects are important to you then I'd suggest using an additional mixer of some type. Personally, I don't use reverb on my voice in most live situations, so I don't miss it. As far as instrument effects go, I use a few pedals on a pedaltrain. In a noisy bar I think I'd prefer the Fishman SA because it clearly has more OOMPH but when playing to an audience that is there to listen to the performance the Compact will shine even in a fairly large room. I'm not able to comment on using it outdoors because I won't get a chance to do that until later in the year. Time will tell how it holds up under a heavy performance schedule. I'm hoping it will not ever fail due to dust/dirt inside the pots like the control board on the SA has done more than once. I’m not knocking the Fishman, it’s a great system, it’s just frustrating to need to clean out the board occasionally.I'd also like to ad, I have no idea what the saying " No Highs, No Lows, Must be Bose" is based on. The L1 Compact has clear crisp highs and very good lows for a solo performing singer/songwriter with a guitar. If anything, as I mentioned earlier, it lacks mids. Perhaps the highs and lows thing refers to the larger systems or maybe to consumers trying to use the unit in ways other than it was intended.I rated it as a 4 but only due to the fact that in its price range it offers less EQ and on-board effects than competitors. Overall:The L1 Compact: Beautifully minimalist, Sleek, stylish, great sound, more than adequate bass for a solo guitarist/vocalist, a dream to set up and tear down, seems very durable, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is seeking simplicity, great sound, and who doesn't want to put heavy boxes up on speaker stands: ) Cheers                
This Bose system is just awesome. I use it at a gym facility for classes as well as background music. The sound quality is top notch and the volume is WAY more than needed. I had thought about supplementing a separate sub to enhance the lower end, but have not really needed to. The acoustics in the gym works well enough. I still may add a sub, as sometimes we do conduct classes outside because of capacity limitations, and the low end is not heard (or felt) as well outside. 
The sound quality so impressed our gym members, that some of them are considered buying their own for their own purposes. 
I rated the Manufacturer Support as 1 star, because I have not needed to use it, therefore I can't rate it.
For some people, the cost might be on the high side. The sound quality, the ease of use, and the versatility makes it worth the cost. If you're looking for a system that is very portable, flexible, and want the quality of sound that only Bose can deliver, then you'll be happy with L1 Compact.                
I've owned four other personal PA systems made by other manufacturers, and this is by far the best. Clear sound, lightweight, small footprint, minimal cords, visually pleasing. Thank you, Bose and Zzounds. And Zounds, thanks also for your Play as You Pay program.                
I've been wanting a nice, compact speaker system I can use for wedding ceremonies, cocktail hours and if the event is small, use them for the whole gig so I decided on the L1 compacts.I purchased two of them and so far have been amazed at the power they deliver. Not really sure about the watts but honestly, they sound amazing. I will be adding a separate bass as I love my low end. While these two have a decent low end, it's just not enough for some hard hitting bass.With that said, I used them at a small venue with about 100 people and they really sounded amazing. I also used 1 for a ceremony due to cable restrictions and that one sounded great for both the officiant and music. If you have the cash and like an elegant look, go for it. I'm still going to add a bass though or just use one of my Mackie 15' thumps for low end.                
This is the best sounding Bose live sound speakers I've heard to date. I did an RTA and revealed its response is fairly neutral, with a light mid high boost to bring out the presence. Microphone does not sound boomy, as the mic input has some EQ applied. The microphone doesn't feed back, even with a SM-58 mic, gain at 1 o'clock, standing 2 ft right in front of the speaker column. The music material sounds punchy, more so than the size of the sub might suggest. The sound quality is on-par with JBL-PRX and QSC powered speakers, just not in terms of output level. You will not find a better sounding integrated system for less than a grand.                
Setup is extremely fast: no poles, no speaker cables, patch cables between amplifier and mixer. Just your instruments/mic and 1 power cord. The modular design allows 3 different speaker heights, depending on how many spacer column you use. When the whole thing is set up, it only takes up a very small footprint: smaller area than a tripod mic stand would occupy. Works very well in tight venues like coffee shop and small classroom.                
It doesn't require a professional sound engineer to make things sound good with this system. Bose did the hard work; you just need to control your volume. 
Everything packs together into 2 light hand-carry stowages. I don't think there is a system out there with a faster setup and easier transporting package.                 
Build quality is top-notched, not a typical made-in-china appearance.                
Everything integrated in a convenient good sounding system for less than a grand. That's quite a value.                
Have not need to use Bose support yet. So can't comment.                
I own it. It has enough appeal to make me want to use it more than I need to use it. The clever design and good build quality does not turn off users like some other cheap products.                
Bose really exercised their product bases to put together this integrated system that makes sense and suits the need of many solo or duo bands. They did it right this time, with a small array at top that projects good distance at useful output levels, with a good gain-before-feedback. You don't need a full-length array for a small system like this. This system will not service a 500-people crowd, nor should it. It has its place.                
Have seen and played with band users of the Bose L1 System and looked forward to getting one.  I was shopping by price so when the system was 10% off I purchased it, adding the tone module since I intend to use it primarily in a guitar/vocal setting.  I was disappointed to discover the tone module required a proprietary power supply.  I went back through the on-line information both from ZZounds and Bose; neither warned me of the requirement.  I did find a user review (after purchase) that had that information.  I think the requirements should be clearly indicated; if the compact system was not designed to be used with the tone module (which the lack of an on-board power supply indicates) then the need and cost of the power supply should be noted.                
I will start by saying I normally am not a fan of Bose...and that is downplaying it. They make decent stuff, but usually you can do better for less money. I have owned QSC K12's recently, amongst many other PA items over the years. But I wanted something for personal type use, for my keyboard, etc... There is no product similar to this piece, so I tried it. There is some dialing in on EQ I had to do, but with my Motif XF8 it was easy. It is fairly amazing that it can disperse the sound so well from a single point. Yes, it is still sort of expensive, but when I take into consideration all the large items I have to carry already, it was the perfect product. I will also say that my first unit came in damaged, and it appears it was a defect off the line. ZZounds went WAY above to help me out since I needed it for a gig. And that is why I will continue to buy from them as I have for a while.                
Most of my music is played through a loop pedal.  I do a lot of beatboxing, vocal  harmonies, and percussion on the guitar. The L1 compact handles this very well.  I have used it to perform for audiences up to 200 people. I have used it outside for parties and events and busking. I've had mine just over a year and have had 0 problems with it.  I highly recommend this system.  I am very happy with my L1 compact.                 
This is by far, the best PA out there. I purchased the T1 ToneMatch Audio Engine Mixer as well. I sing at Senior Centers and Nursing Homes. The sound is clear, clean without fatigueing the listeners. No matter where they are in the room, the systems delivers the same crisp, clear sound that is comfortable to everyone.
As a performer, I absolutely need to be able to hear myself and I can anywhere in the room. What I am putting out to the listner is the same sound I hear myself. I no longer need a monitor of any kind.
Used Bose tech support to get going and they are excellent. The purchase from ZZ Sounds is always smooth and effortless. Not to mention the payment plan.
A very satisified customer indeed.
This system is perfect for my company!  DC2DW DVDJ Entertainment has found the perfect sound with these speakers.  This was my third one and I just order my 4th one!!!  I love the way the sound and my customers are always amazed when I set them up and turn them!!!!  The Ultimate Sound!!!                
I have been singing in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and churches for over 12 years, and this is the 4th system I have used. It is by far the best and lightest, and I would recommend it for any similar situation. I received it on a Tuesday morning, tried it, and used it that afternoon for a program. Everything worked great! I use it about 17 times each month. (I haven't had to use any manufacturer support so can't tell about that)                
Having used this product with the L1 and B2 bass module I was already familiar with the product. I needed one for our Karoake group that I could carry to the member performers' homes. I got this system and it sounds fantastic!!!! It is worth every penny and more! The staff at ZZounds is just excellent. Very professional to deal with, courteous and knowledgeable. They even got me the 4 pay credit arrangement that I was not aware of and the entire transaction was smooth. You even get a monthly reminder for the payment being taken from the credit card so there are no surprises!!!! Just overall an A+ company, product and staff!!! I have also recommended this product to any of our Karaoke group members who is interested in owning and they are all sold on the idea after listening to the sound!!!                
The Bose L1 system is absolutely perfect for my acoustic duo. We also use some recorded tracks, and the system handles the bass & drums flawlessly! True Bose ambience! Thank you ZZounds for making it easy with 12 payments!                
Great sound. I hear it in my performances but more importantly from the response from my audiences. A must for singers, keys etc. soloist                
I've used the L1 Portable on five gigs since purchasing it three weeks ago. I love it's compact portability and the quick setup. I've received numerous positive comments about how great the sound output is. I wish I'd purchased it earlier.                
I bought this Pa system a few months ago after exhausting research done on many systems/combo systems..I'm a jazz guitarist that needed a small, but high quality system for banquet halls, reatuarants, etc..I use backing tracks through my laptop, but then sometimes play with a bass player, keyboardist and drummer..I'm extremely pleased with the quality of sound this thing puts out...it is exactly what i wanted...I do use a small powered monitor off to the side( 12in. speaker)...but only when playing larger rooms..everyone is impressed with the sound ...I currently use a small mixer for my running my electric and nylon string guitars through...jeyboards added and synth drums when a drummer is present...it handle all of this very well...I will say, though that if you find yourself playing for in a larger room and find that you need to crank the volume really high..it will clip...as i'm sure any system would...so when Bose says for audiences up to 100 people I've found that to be an accurate statement..I have a friend with the next level up system and we've played together for events, combine the 2 systems and it sounded fabulous...I'd replace this system immediately if something happened to it...there is a place here in the city that deals with used Pa equipment...they tell me they've NEVER had any of the array systems from Bose in for repairs...It's awesome...I suggest buying it.                
Great sound for small to medium venues for my Karaoke shows, and set-up time has been decreased by 65%.                
great product sounds just as good as 2 srm 450 mackies                
This System is awesome. Going to get  the bigger system soon. Love it!                
I am by no means a professional musician but like many of us out there who like to jam with other friends or occasionally play a small gig in front of an audience, this is certainly the way to go. Very impressed with the sound and power and the ability to store it in a small space. I added the ToneMatch to my system which I highly recommend. I use both electric and acoustic guitars along with singing and the ToneMatch makes it all come together with great sound. I recommend this as there should be more inputs on the actual Bose L1 system. Never would have thought so much sound would come out of a speaker system like this does.                
Great sound system for small and medium venues. Easy to set up and a pleasure to carry due to light weight. Sets up in about 5 minutes. Yes, It's that easy. Sound is full and clear. Makes the guitar sing and voice not muddy. I will be adding on to this system with more Bose equipment.                 
Well, I reviewed this unit once already but need to do it again.  After comparing it numerous times side by side with the Fishman SA 220 I've decided to send the L1 Compact back.  It sounds good and is really nice to set up and tear down.  The highs are crisp and clean and the lows are very good for acoustic guitar.  However, it lacks the warmth in the tone that I hear in the Fishman system and also is not nearly as powerful at projecting sound as the SA220.  Ultimately, I decided it was too much $ to spend on a specialty unit for small/up close venues.  In my experience the Fishman SA can do everything the L1 Compact can do and more.
Great product for what it is, but not for me.
zZounds is absolutely fantastic for their great customer service, fast shipping and Play as You Pay program!                
I like the sound on this amp and it is only about half as heavy as my old amp                
The Bose system rocks  all my guys luv it.  Clear as a Bell.....with no Monitors. Bought the compact to add to my existing L1 system for larger gigs.  The big L1 goes up front and the Baby is used for Monitors.....GR8 combination.                
I'm part of a trio that consists of two guitarists and a bass plus a drum machine. Our audiences are generally under 100 people and the Bose L1 works great for what we do. We got it because we were tired of moving 70 lbs JBL cabinets and stands. We use a 12 channel powered mixer and run a line level signal to the bose. Because the mixer is powered, we could add the additional speakers for a larger venue in addition to the bose if it were necessary. But we don't anticipate a need for that just now. I do recommend using a mixer with some effects, I find plugging directly into the bose to be a little plain sounding. Quite pleased overall.                
I should have not expected anything less. Vocals are incredible. Power is just right for what I need. Very easy to use and very compact.                
Excellent sound! very clean with a nice bass punch so light weight easy to set up perfect for smaller venues                
Sound was great.                
Easy thing to setup ever!!                
A five year old could do the setup for you. No need to get a crew to do something small. Easy, portability, and no large vehicle needed to carry it.                
Great quality. Built solid, but not heavy. Looks great.                
For the amount of money I wouldn't suggest it if you are doing something "big". If you do small get together, stand out in front of buildings and give speeches, or play on the corner, and small outdoor events it's great.                
No need                
Only in a small area was the WOW factor present.                
The sound was good but not enough "boom" I like heavy bass without Bose's other components it wasn't loud enough. If you are looking to do a small outdoor event, For a presentation the simple setup is perfect. For me it didn't have enough Shake rattle and roll.                
Its simple and easy to use, sounds great! Thanks ZZounds for making my first Bose system affordable                
This is the go to system for solo acoustic acts.  It's light, easy to set up and it sounds great.  I also use it with a mixer when I need more channels.  Ideally, I think it works better alone with a guitar and mic.  The only problem I have with it is that it feeds back pretty much all of the time.  I often play small rooms where I am wedged in a corner and it's hard to not stand in front of the unit.  If I can have it out to the side there are no feedback problems.  It also serves well as a monitor for my band.  I played a loud room the other night with a trio and volume was a bit of a problem.  If I tried to turn up the volume it fed back.  It is also a bit pricy in my opinion.  That being said I would definitely recommend this system if you have the cash                
Plug it in, and you are ready to go.                
After reading all the great reviews.. a few by fellow DJ's I was totally stoked to get my new BOSE L1 Compact system,,.. after getting and trying it out I couldn't be more disappointed.. its going back tomorrow.. This unit sucks playing music.. No High, No Lows.. all Middle.. I am not paying another $400+ for the Tone Match system to make it work right.. I picked up the LD Systems MAUI 5 Ultra-Portable Column PA System several months ago and just did a side by side comparison with its BOSE cousin... the MAUI 5 wipes its rear with the BOSE L1... not even close.  I am getting a second MAUI 5                
good sound over priced needs built effects line outs separate from each channel, very under powered, if i could do it all over i would go for the again over priced li sys for more power                
Our company initially purchased six of these for presentation media audio support, corporate presentations, small venue music playback & portable audio.  Compared to most of the "speakers on a stick" (JBL Eon, Mackies, et. al.) they are easy to set up, sound reasonably well for speech but absolutely suck for music playback.  We've liked the appearance of this and the Sennheiser K Arrays but audio quality and $$$ has been disappointing.  On our trip down to NAMM earlier this year we saw a new German company, LD Systems and their Maui series speakers that absolutely blew us away!  Better bass, true mid/high response and less $$ than either.  If our fleet of JBL Eons could last another season we wouldn't be shopping so intensely but from what we've heard Bose will not be in our future.                
The sound quality is pretty good. Its nice and clear. Loud. I just wish it had a little more bass. I used this system for a small DJ gig. I think the sound is great for a small house party (indoors). If your looking for something with a little more power and bass I'd recommend the Bose L1 Model I System Single Bass Package. I'd recommend this particular speaker for a guitar or any other live instrument. I would not recommend this speaker for a DJ gigging at large venues. This is more for a smaller DJ gig or maybe even better used as practice speakers.                 
The product included carrying cases!                
This speaker is very easy to use. The best part is how easy it is to put the speaker together and to take it apart. It's super light. Its powered so thats another great thing about it. Its super simple and to the point when it come to connecting a guitar or a mixer or for most instruments for that matter.                
The product is high quality which you can expect from most if not all Bose products. Very dependable, feels sturdy. I think this product would be good for traveling. It's very compact and easy to carry around. It's super light also. Seems like it'll last a long time.                
Yes it's definitely worth the money!                
Haven't had to deal with support so that's a good thing !                
It's pretty sexy ;) very nice design i must say.                
I would keep this speaker but I would also want to have something a little more powerful for DJ gigs. More bass specifically. You can never have enough bass when it comes to spinning records. But i think this is a great speaker for live instruments as well as a great clear quality practice speaker for todays DJ.                
I ordered this not knowing what to expect. It works great for the events that I DJ at. Majority of my events are weddings. It sounds great and will get loud. Works great in spreading out the sound throughout an entire area. I was worried if it would put out enough bass with the (2) additional bass modules. It has done more than I expected. Most important of them all....it is easy to set up and less to carry around than your traditional speakers. Can set up in less than 5 minutes straight out of the protective carrying bag that BOSE sends with this product. You will not regret ordering this system. The cost is high but it is well worth it. I ordered it on a Monday and received the entire system on a Thursday and was playing at my first event on a Friday Night. I left my traditional PEAVEY system at home and have not used it since. That was over a month ago. I still like my PEAVEY System but I will use my BOSE System wherever and whenever I can. Thank You zZounds!                
I love this system switching from my QSC to several Bose L1 model II B2 systems the sound and bass  thumps get the power pack. My customers love my sound and the sleek style of the bose system.                
I recently bought the L1 and the compact and use them together with the double bass pkg. On the advice of a friend I passed on the Tone Match engine and intead bought a small passive mixer. I have a five piece band with drummer, bass, two electric guitars and acoustic. I was really skeptical that the system would have enough punch to cut thru all the noise on stage. I've been hauling around tons of equipment for years and finally decided to give it a try. I couldn't be happier. No you're not going to play a stadium with this system but so far I've never been dissapointed. We've played rodeo dances and fairly large outdoor venues without a problem. Our set up and sound check time is a third of what it used to be and we no longer have to use a trailer. Mission acomplished Bose! I don't know how you get so much sound out of such a small system! I'm very pleased and would highly reccomend it. My only complaint is that the cords for the bass units are too short...and they're very expensive to replace.                
Used the item outdoors for a wedding with about 150 people. The sound was easily better than any other PA system I've used in that situation. The LII's resistance to feedback really helped when micing people and made for a very natural sound.                 
T1 remote very extensive and helpful. Good sound and processing. Little bit of learning curve to use all the features, but it gets you up and running with minimal effort.                 
By far the easiest to move and quickest to set of any PA I've used.                
Everything was made very well and felt solid and well designed. You can tell they put alot of money into the engineering.                 
A little expensive, but totally worth it for a DJ who wants a simple and attractive setup, or for an idiot proof PA.                 
Haven't had to deal directly with Bose, but I was impressed by the solid design of the product.                
Very sexy PA.                
Overall this is a great product. The price is a little hard to swallow, but the value is really outstanding. It is a great investment.                 
I Have two of these towers now. Both from ZZounds.com. All I can say is WOW! I was skeptical at first. But after trying them together, they are amazing. I use one for my acoustic show (3pc with guitar, bass, conga drum, vocals) and its overkill, but crystal clear and amazing sound. 
I also DJ for different events as well as a 500 person capacity club. It meets all my needs other than I think I will add an extra B2 module or two for the club. Its plenty loud for the areas I play, however in a full club of that size the bass end gets soaked up and I'm playing mostly dance/club songs that require strong bass. 
I've used it with my rock band and it is great. We got rid of the monitors, other than our drummer who uses in-ear monitors, and thats just because he wants the personal mix. Again, it would be nice to have the extra sub when playing the big club, but for your midsized bars, these two systems are quite enough for a rock band. 
My only critique is no XLR inputs. I'd like to have the option to use XLR instead of 1/4" but no luck.
overall, this is an amazing product. Its pricey, but for anything else out there that offers what these towers offer, its very reasonably priced. No more 150# speakers to carry!!                 
After reading all the hoopla about the Bose L1 Model II with the new B2 bass module, I finally broke down and decided to give one a try(without the Tone Match Engine). I have never been too impressed with the specs on Bose speakers; in the past 35 years of playing music professionally, running sound and as a recording studio engineer, I have only used Bose as a "cheap" monitor reference while mastering in the studio. Bose are the speakers that I turn on to see how a master might sound in someone's car...
The L1 series II is really something that you need to actually hear to appriciate! I set up one tower in my recording studio's 25x40' acustically dead room, cranked up some music that had good punchy bass and drums and was amazed! This system is loud,  punchy and ultra clear. 
Since the dead room is used as a band rehersal space as well, I decided to use the L1 system as a single monitoring system for the three bands that use the space to practice for a couple weeks to see what the musicians thought about the system's performance. The bands are classic rock, world beat and Americana. To make a long story short: everyone is now scrambling to sell the PA systems that they currently have to purchase L1 series II systems.....That says a lot....These folks are serious musicians and many of them professionals. The main comments from the musicians was how clear the mix was, how smooth the highs were and the fact that no matter where they were in the room, the sound was the same. One comment to note from the rock drummer(and drum shop owner): "I can't believe the kick drum sound that is comming from that little system!" 
The new B2 bass module is impressive however, outside or larger (200+) indoor venues and / or needing to reset someone's pace maker via kick drum may require extra subwoofers in the rock world. FYI: the L1 tower can get loud enough to need to Mic. the drums in order for them to "keep up".
Some folks seem to think that the L1 array system is too expensive for what it is. Personally, given the 7' tower throwing sound from the floor up and the fact that the array really does throw sound nearly 180 degrees to the sides, I would think that it would cost more to stack and splay several speaker cabinets to cover the same acoustic space(not to mention the size difference;-)
Down side(not much to say here):
The input is TRS only. I would have hope for a XLR/TRS combo jack to avoid looking around for XLR to TRS adapters to plug in.
The fact the Bose does not use compression drivers or another from of tweeter in their design does mean that the highs(above ~12.5k) roll off pretty fast. However, I found that there is plenty is "sizzle" on the vocals and cymbals with a bit of  EQ tweaking not to care much about the highs not keeping up (spec wise) with other live speaker systems out there.
The L1 / B2 system that I received needed to have a firmware upgrade in order to take advantage of the B2's bass response switch. The upgrade requires the Tone Match engine to "talk" to the the power base. I guess I'm lucky that there was a local music store that happened to have one that I could use to upgrade with.
I plan to purchase one more L1 series II with the B2 module in the near future to use in a stereo live rig. I have not heard anything out there in the same price range that can compete with these arrays.                
I have many years in broadcasting, specifically radio and audio production. I am retired now and DJ/KJ on the weekends, and also sing in a classic rock band. I have been through *many* systems over the years, from Klipsch to EV, but like someone mentioned in another review, I too am scrambling to sell everything. The Bose L1 Model II system I bought has the T1 unit, and a B2 subwoofer. I use it twice a week for karaoke, once a month for weddings and parties, and twice a month for my band. The sound fills every corner of the room, even when playing outside it has the longest "throw" of anything I have used short of a flying array. The B2 bass module is pretty potent for its size, it works great for small venues, but if you want chest pounding bass for hip-hop, look for a powered 18" from one of the major manufacturers. The T1 mixer may be small, but Bose packed some good stuff in the box! Compression, EQ, modeling, USB sound, and more. I have been sailing with my L1 for several months now, and consider it to be one of the best purchases ever, and I will be adding a second L1 very soon. If you are on the fence about the investment on this system, I have two words of advice to give you... DO IT!                
This is my second L1 system, I had two L1s with 8 B1s and two packlite amps back in 2008 and it was really a great system but I had too many B-1s (8) to get the bass response I needed for my mobile DJ needs. Now with the B2 bass module I can get the sound I want with four bass modules and two L1s and two packlite amps. The sound is amazing and I always get compliments during each show I perform at. Everyone is just amazed at how it sounds and they see the name Bose and they say, "no wonder, its Bose".  Others say, "I have never seen a Bose setup like this before". This is an expensive system so be prepared to fork out a lot of money but if you like Bose as I do then the price doesn't matter.                
I am a previous owner of a L-I model I and model II systems. This setup with two B2s and a packlight amp sounds excellent if you need extra low end. The B2 is a huge improvement over the B1 bass module. Some people may complain that portability is lost because the cabinet is significantly larger and heavier but I say not!  The average person can carry one in each hand during setup and tear down. I've always been a Bose fan so to me this is an investment and definitely money well spent!!                
i spent a lot of time reading the Bose blogs before buying.  My objectives were better sound, less gear and quicker set-up times.  The sound quality is awesome, beyond my expectations!                 
I love this product! I travel and sing full time so I needed something compact with a big sound. That totally describes this product! It fits in my small car and puts out a sound you wouldn't believe. I'm a female, and sometimes I can't carry heavy equipment. I have no problem with this. It's lightweight and easy to fill up. It filled up a 500 seater auditorium WITH my band plugged in my board at only half volume. Amazing! I highly recommend it!                
What I mean by the title is that this system is excellent in sound and quality. But, for the price you can get better sounding speakers such as the QSCs. And after buying these I found that this is a heavy set up after all. Quick set up, but heavy.Be sure to get the SKB hard cases to protect this exspensive system.                
I'VE BEEN IN THE MUSIC GAME SINCE 1962 (YES I'M OLD SCHOOL) AND BUYING THE Bose L1 Model 1S with B1 Bass Module WAS  THE  FINEST PRODUCT THAT YOUR MONEY CAN BUY.  IT IS TRULY  AN AWAKENING TO HEAR WHAT THE AUDIENCE HEARS.  THE ONLY FAULT  THAT I CAN THINK OF IS, WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG... YOU WILL LOVE IT IF YOU ARE REALLY ANY MUSICIAN AT ALL. zZOUNDS MADE IT EASY  TO BE WITHIN MY GRASP WITH A 12 PAYMENT PLAN AND THEY SHIPPED FAST.  ALL I CAN ADD IS TO ACT NOW WHILE YOU CAN!
THANKS zZOUNDS. 
Hi, I am a female that collects music, videos and karaoke.  I dj for many events and purchasing Bose L1 have been the best decision I made.  Less carrying and storing my equipment.  I plan to purchase another set this year.  I recommend to get this speaker because you do not have to carry many speakers.  I feel good when people view and stare at my equipment.                  
I play in a band and DJ Wedding Receptions...the set up is easy and the sound is great. It's so clear I'm hearing parts of songs I never knew existed.                
I sold my old PA system, which was 4 peavey PR15 speakers and a Yamaha emx512 power mixer. I bought the L1S mostly for the mobility, its a pain to lug those peavey's everywhere. Anyway I then bought the Allen & Heath ZED 10FX mixer.I love this New setup! I do Karaoke Hosting and usually have crowds near 100. I only use 25% of this systems Capacity. For DJing I wouldn't get anymore than this, although I did buy another B1 sub. and it does make a difference.                
I've borrowed both the L1 and L1 S1 for my acoustic duo and these are really awesome.  Love the easy carry in and setup.  The L1S1 is definitely the better and worth the extra money in my opinion.  We play at venues as small as 60 people and up to easily 300 or more... even outdoors and this system kicks @ss.  Been in the business for 30 years, and I own PA stuff big enough to fill an auditorium, but the Bose stick is my PA of choice now! I'll be buying soon as I can sell off the big stuff.                
For my purposes the Bose L1/B1 Bass system has revolutionized my PA system. As an aging musician, no more lugging heavy speakers and monitors. Setup is incredibly fast and easy. I love Bose's technology that minimizes volume drop-off while filling the back corners of the room. I love hearing the room mix while worrying less about mic feedback. I'm saving my lunch money to get a matching module so to really fill a good size room.                
Total awesome!                
I've been a DJ for about 15 years now...and the sounds are the heart of the performance as far as I am concerned. People always  think the lights are what matters, or the hardware like turntables that make the DJ show amazing. I'm here to tell you, it's the sounds! This Bose product is the best speaker system I have ever purchased. From going from heavy 15" speakers to these is a huge change. They are so compact, easy to transport and loud as hell. They connect to almost anything as long as it has a 1/4" plug. I just had to get another one! I have a small Honda Civic, and I fit 2 of these systems comfortably. Every gig I get amazes people. "Is all that sound coming from that speaker?", they ask. And I answer with a big smile and say, "YES!" I LOVE IT!!                
For a number of years, I've been thinking about getting a Bose system. Because they are rather rare where I live, it's been difficult to get my hands (and ears) on one. I was able to listen to one at a local big box music retailer for just a few minutes and had the opportunity to work a mixer for a bit. That was a few months ago.So, in my email, a message from Zzounds comes along offering the 12 payment plan. Without hesitation, I decide to order a L1 1S with B2 Bass Module. Now, in the back of my mind my spider-sense was tingling... will it sound as good as I hope it will? Will my concerns about the "punch" and "highs/lows" be resolved? Well, the unit arrived quickly and a few days later I had the opportunity to try it out for a holiday party with karaoke.I have to say that I was literally blown away by the sound and quality of this set up! The venue was mid-sized and the throw was great. People in the back of the room could hear everything. While the karaoke singers were on stage, they could hear themselves without the need for a separate monitor and when I needed to kick up the volume for DJ music, the B2 sub gave me the kick I needed to get people dancing. The best part was the bar owner's expression when he saw what was providing all of that sound!The next week, I had another holiday party, this time with live music. Besides being a DJ, I perform as a one-man act with keys, horns and sing. This venue was larger and had about 150 people. Well, the Bose killed it!During this event, they needed to speak to the audience for about a half hour and the podium was on the other side of the room (about 75 feet away) Not once did anyone look at me with that "I can't hear him look..."While I still need to use this at a smaller weeding, I felt confident enough in what I've heard so far to write this review. If it keeps amazing me with it's versatility and sound quality, I'll be buying another identical set up next season.                
I bought the Bose L1 system to replace my 4 peavy speakers. It really amazes me as to how well the Bose system works. I have people telling me that it blows my old setup out of the water. Set up time is greatly reduced. Sound quality is great.  If you are worried about not having enough let me tell you there are no worries. 
As they say "You get what you pay for" if you can afford to buy this system I highly recommend it.                
I bought this just for my patio parties.  I went to the music store and got two different cables and addapter to plug into my iPhone 6 and play off of Pandora.  At first the sound was not good and I was worried.  When i used the large cable with the adaptor, it was amazing!!!!  I love it!!!!                
This thing has the goods my friends. I haven't seen anyone review this that plays heavier music so I had to put in my thoughts. The clearity and punch you get from this thing is rediculous and it works amazing right out of the box. The addition of the B2 to this just makes this thing purr... I have yet to use this live, but after dealing with too many egos I was more then happy to temperarly replace the members I cant find with this bad boy and a computer with canned tracks. Which may not sound very metal but its what I have to do to to get my music performed in this climate. This thing keeps up with my 5150 iii well and I can play at comfortable volumes which the fans will enjoy I'm pretty sure. Its plunty loud and doesnt feedback with vocal microphones which still impresses me everytime I turn it on. I love it and can't wait to get a second one. The only thing better then this is the L1 model 2 that my dad has but this one was just priced so great with Zzounds payment options ( which is the greatest thing to happen to musicians in a very long time) I had to go with it and I don't regret it at all. This site is why I'm able to own such great gear! Thank you so so much Zzounds! Try this out, you wont regret it!                
This is my very first Bose purchase and I must say, it is every bit amazing as they all say. It was a breeze to put together. Takes up very little space and sounds amazing! Zzounds is all amazing! Product cam win perfectly safe and in working condition straight out of the box. It arrived exactly when they said it would...even all the way here in Hawaii. The payment plans are the reason I could make this purchase possible. Thank you thank you a million times, thank you!!!                
Well, I bought two of these after hearing a demo at guitar center. This beast has everything I need for my sound system. I am mobile DJ just started, but I did want to go to the lower end speakers...I have Peavey speakers, two Peavey PV115D powered speaker and two Peavey PV118 passive subwoofer. These Peavey speaker have no match with my Bose system. I normally use my Bose in doors, and Peaveys for outdoors. Sound is perfect to me, I always Bose system at home. It is very expensive, but it is worth investing for a good quality sound.                 
The system is perfect for my needs                
The best clear sound I've heard in years. I was reluctant at first to jump in on ths system because of the price and smallness of the speakers, was worried about the loudness in a crowded bar or wedding venue. Did my homework, talked to a lot of people and made the decision and wish I would have done it sooner. The system is light, well cased, and is literally 10 minutes from playing a gig. As soon as this one is payed for I will upgrade and buy another. Haven't needed manufacturers support and the sound is the best, I used JBL and QSC and Peavey before, They are heavy and take up so much room. With the B2 Bass I will never go back.                
This is an awesome piece, I took it out of the box and set it up right away. The sound is impeccable and I would recommend this to anyone that does DJ or live performance. I'm going to use this mainly for weddings and some karaoke gigs. I haven't had to use the manufacturers support.                
I suffer from tinnitus and drive a lot for work, almost like a truck driver. The road noise eventually started making my tinnitus worse so I decided to give these a try. They keep everything quieter and when I want to listen to music at low volumes I can hear everything super clear.They are so comfortable I sometimes forget I'm wearing them and I feel like the sound is coming from the car speakers instead of the headphones.The only bad thing that I've been able to find is of course noise cancelling headphones have microphones that capture noise and produce a negative sound wave to cancel out the noise. But something weird is that when it's super windy outside and even with the windows closed, the wind still affects the headphones a little bit and creates a sudden noise. I wonder why this happens if the wind is not directly hitting the microphones.That happens just every now and then and I hope Bose fixes this issue in the next model.                
I felt I was taking a massive risk in buying these, ultra overpriced I felt. The worst that could happen would just be that I'd return them and survive it. 
But I like these too much to send them back. I got the silver ones, they look awesome. The sound is perfect, the noise cancellation is very powerful and the aesthetics are great, especially the silver one. They are very comfortable and flexible and have extremely convienent controls and the way the inside of the headphones have a huge R and L in it is really neat and helpful. It's so nice to have a bluetooth connection! That is extremely helpful in so many ways. 
I'd buy this if you both have the money and don't want to buy another pair of headphones or ear buds ever again. And if you fly a lot of have good reason to get noise cancellation, or just enjoy having it. I love zZounds for their payment plans, makes everything possible and reasonable. 
Be sure to get the Bose app straightaway for it. I will rarely ever use the voice function but it's neat to know I have it. I might get in the habit of using it in the future I imagine.
I'm sure the customer support is great but don't anticipate ever needing to contact them about anything. 
Again, everything is very, well, exquisite is the word. Extremely expensive, scary expensive but it is worth every penny in the end. I expect tremendous mileage out of these.                 
The dispersion of clear sound is amazing, the selectable mic or guitar ToneMatch settings help to cut thru the mix. Bluetooth sound has no EQ control just overall volume.                
Portability and onBoard ToneMatch with Reverb are the key features that got me. Bluetooth was a bonus.                
This unit is plug and play, or unplug and play, it’s that simple.                
Unit feels well made and sturdy. Rubber padding on cabinet for all three positions: Tabletop/Tiltback/Monitor. Knob pots are smooth. Top handle is solid, the whole look of the unit is Pro.                
Compared to other items with similar features, this speaker is way to expensive, But I personally feel it’s worth the price, for Portability, Reliability, Sound Quality, Manufactures Support aanndd it has a TRS LIne out.                
I had a problem with the red light flashing while I had the unit plugged in to outlet strip, looked at manual, no info, found a sticker that says flashing red means less than 10% battery life. Talked to Bose while driving to work. Advised Reset unit. In the end, I had been using it on battery power while plugged in because strip was OFF.                 
It Looks Pro, it Sounds Pro and it Feels Pro                
Gotta Have It.                
I just got delivery on the two Bose S1 Pro Units and am very pleased and true to Bose they deliver the sound for me every time Im use them. These little boxes are only 15 pounds but have the sound including low end of a much bigger box. I just ordered another one ! I just did the update also though the Bose web site so that you can use the Bose connect app to stream two together. Lightweight, powerful, full rich sound and great low end. The battery does what they say it does nd runs for hours .I ran it for about 4 hours first time with much more to spare.I have called Bose several times and they are quick and informative .That s one of the reasons I really like Bose .I use these for small Dj events and corporate they are great !                
First off, these are not only small and light, but easily the most powerful portable speakers I have used professionally. If you are a DJ these may just change your life! Gigging people everywhere, this will more than cover most shows with 100+ persons. The speakers are very versatile, I have used them for my guitar, directly in with the "ToneMatch" on guitar. Reverb is good and the EQ settings do assist getting a great sound. Phantom Power is not available on the unit, (the only mark missed in my opinion). My Shure SM 57 and 58's as well as the Sennhiesers 906e work well and sound clear as a bell. Singing and playing setup is very easy, as well as tearing down. I bought a Pair of Live sound Mini PA speaker stands to use these, the speakers are light and are a good fit you wont need the full size stands unless you want to get the speaker up high. They work good in the 3 positions they were designed for, and the EQ actually accommodates and changes for each change. I have used the BOSE Connect App to connect the speakers via Bluetooth in Stereo. I will let you know, that I did have to update the speakers to get this to work. The Bose site actually had this listed and the solution to resolve the issue. I have put actual distortion pedals into the speakers and it sounds well, the reverb and the ToneMatch give the sound of an amp! (very good sound with some tweaking) I love this setup for my OPEN Mic nights! I use one Bose S1,Two BOSS WL20 wireless systems, one Bogner Red Extacy Pedal and a Charvel San Dimas guitar. All battery, all wireless and all awesome. I am actually building more wireless options and rigs that have more versatility. I cannot rave enough about these incredible Speakers. Try one and see what you have been missing! I plan to but 4 more and replace my Huge PA Speakers with these. I can see the possibilities and so will you.                
I purchased this speaker for little reunions, listen to music, karaoke and it just sounds great. Clean sound, portable and very well built. Very happy with this speaker.                
My S1Pro was delivered 3 days ago and I can’t believe something that light weight and small can deliver the sound quality I come to expect from BOSE. I love it. The sound is similar to my L1S1 towers. If you are looking for a true, quality practice system, this is it. I used it at band practice yesterday and the other guys couldn’t believe what they were hearing. If I could give it 6 stars I would. The only drawback is there is no phantom power button for my shure 87 A mic. I needed to attach one of my tone matches to get the phantom power. Adding the seoerate tone match also increases the number of channels. At practice I had 3 mics, a guitar and a bass going through it at the same time and it was crystal clear.                
WOW! RIDICULOUS! IMPOSSIBLE! ... This pa is on another level. Remarkable engineering to get crisp, clear, powerful sounds from a speaker of this size and portability. Acoustic guitar and vocals are amazing! Dispersion is amazing as well. Buy it. You will not regret it. Thanks to zZounds for great service always!                
I bought this on a whim to try it out. It certainly has that "Bose" sound. Heavy bass, sometimes hard sounding highs but with decent midrange. You can tell it's heavily processed via EQ curve. I bought it mainly for a back yard Bluetooth speaker. In the upright position either on a table or stand, the bass is so forward that it distorts very easily even at mid volume with modern bass heavy music. Older 80s music is not an issue. IF it had a bass level on the Bluetooth input where you could dial it down, that my have helped. Unfortunately it does not. 
I find it funny how every on of the professional demos are acoustic guitar. It sounds great with that but put real world music through it and it disappoints. I suppose if you were using it in a PA system and were able to filter out the bass and send it to a subwoofer, it would work pretty good. 
Not sure if I'm keeping it. For $600 I expected more. I thought I may have gotten bit by the Bose bug but I think I'm just going to swat it away.                 
MAGNIFICO, EXTRAORDINARIO,VERSATIL, MUY MUY CHINGON !!!!!!!! thanks zzounds for the opportunity of financing !!!!!!awesome !!! 10 stars.for both .                
I am not a newcomer to pa systems small or medium sized.I fogured its a Bose so it will fill a room with good quality clean crisp sound.Well....in a small living room area with 20 people the volumes on the mixer were maxed out and it was not enough!Mike had no headroom. Ok it sounded ok but not sensational as the price tag would suggest.my Behringer 8" powered speaker and Behringer mixer have way more punch and volume......sent it back.....                
Excellent quality. Comes with a dust cover, battery pack and power cord. The sound is what makes or breaks this speaker. I would not use these for studio monitors or critical listening. I was playing some 24 bit HiRes AIFF files, and it could not keep up with a balanced frequency. I compared the Bose to different set of HiRes studio monitors. It gets the drum frequencies right, but it fails with ambience and vocals. You'll notice a big dip in the volume, as if you lowered a certain track during you're mixing. Very weird and disappointing. I found this speaker to sound phenomenal with YouTube videos and movies. Nice and smooth!. It just failed when it had to perform for my DAW. So confusing!. To conclude, my music is way too ambient for the Bose S1 Pro.. The Bose Acoustimas system sounds way better. I was just annoyed with a big sub bass under my desk and wires. When it comes to the S1 Pro,  I do see this more ideal for live instruments, video games and movies. I would not recommend for DAWs and music purist.                
I recently purchased one of these for my wife, pairing with her phone was very easy! The sound, in particular the bass was very surprising in it's punchiness and clarity. My wife loves this little speaker and uses it often! If you're looking for a small easy to use great sounding little speaker this Bose Soundlink Color 2 will not disappoint!                 
I own several Bose products,and this one is no different! Amazing sound ,easy hookup ,and very easy to program. Very satisfied! I will be buying more!                
This was a guilty pleasure purchase for me! The last thing I needed was another pair of bluetooth speakers! But, WOW! I am so glad I purchased these! They have replaced just about every pair of headphones and bluetooth speakers I own. I had no idea what I was going to use these for! But I wear them to work everyday and I wear them around the house when I'm doing chores. The sound quality is fantastic and the sound stage and imaging are outstanding as well! Get a pair, you won't regret it!                
I purchased two Bose SoundTouch 10's and a SoundTouch Wireless Link. I wanted to buy at least one of the larger Bose SoundTouch units for bigger, better sound. I was replacing a Nyne bluetooth and an ipod nano touch.Setup was simple once I downloaded the app on my phone and computer. I programmed my iTunes playlists in the six available presets fairly easily. The app could be a little simpler to operate (very simple on setup).But what blows me away is the sound quality, and beefy bass response, that you get out of this little speaker. It is easily half the size of what I replaced, but the sound quality is much better, and just as "big" if not bigger. If I was filling a larger space, I would definitely want the SoundTouch 20 or 30 units. But if you're holding off because you don't think the smallest of these speakers will get the job done, think again. After all, it is Bose.                
I absolutely love these earbuds! They have amazing sound quality! Deep lows, smooth midrange and airy highs! These buds sound almost like full size headphones! I also like the fact that these don't feel like they're going to fall out of my ears. I had a pair of Apple AirPods and these blow them away in every respect! And of course, zZounds made it easy to purchase these through their wonderful, "Pay-as-you-Play" program!                
Great cable. Soft, pliable casing prevents kinks and makes it easy to roll up and unroll while on the road. By the way, the cable is 18ft. Long. This spec seems to be missing in sales specifications.                
The clamp is made of plastic that breaks very easily even while being careful with it. The clamp adjusts to several sizes which is very well thought out. The problem is the material the clamp is made from.                
This is the shoddiest music accessory ever made. It's made of plastic, and after a couple of uses it will no longer fully clamp down. Shortly after that, it will break, allowing your $500 tonematch (also made of plastic) to fall to the stage. With all of Bose's innovations, one would think that their engineers could design a simple, METAL, reliable device for attaching the tonematch to the mic stand.                
Does exactly what it says. There is no hum on any channel like many other cheaply made A/B switches and LED indicators make it easy to quickly view the routing. Long battery life makes this sleek switch a winner.                
Seamless, silent switching.  No degradation of sound at all.                
Very basic and simple.  Does just exactly what it's meant for.                
Metal case, GT-6 switch, rubber,non-slip base, heavy, I don't think this unit could be constructed any better!                
A little pricey, but look at the quality and the silent switching circuitry.  I would gladly pay this much again!                
I'm guessing Boss is okay on support, I've never had to find out!                
I don't just want it, I need it.  I use a Fender Twin Reverb amp and use it for channel switching.                
Better than anything else out there for this purpose!                
It's silent, which is what it's supposed to be.                
Does one very simple thing and does it efficiently.                 
Plug in 3 cords, step on a switch. Can't be easier.                
Seems very sturdy. Very small, will take up no room on my board. Very Nice.                
$30 some dollars. Can't get better than that.                
Haven't needed it, doubt I will.                
It's kind of like a girl you've been dating a long time. You know where it's going to be and what it's going to do. You don't think of it as sexy, but it's nice to have around.                
It's simple and effective.                
This pedal has excellent sound. I love instead of turning off the Distortion and getting a hollow sounding clean electric, now I just hit the stompbox and it sounds like I just picked up my acoustic that's sitting in the corner (Which is just too far to consider).                
The preset modes are nice, the Piezo is my personal preference. The Top and Body tone knobs are effective and can greatly change your sound, and the Reverb function is high quality and useful.                
Standard Boss: Plug and play.                
Standard Boss Again: I'd imagine if I threw this pedal off of the roof it might break a knob off, but they pedal would still work. This pedal feels like a beast for its size.                
Never needed support.                
Overall I'd give this pedal a 9, only because you have to adjust it quite a bit if you plug into a new amp to get the perfect sound you want.                
Cheesy, unrealistic, failed for my tastes and purposes. Well made and durable, though. i owned it , and i was glad to sell it to a friend who liked it!                
Stereo inputs would've been nice, especially if one input would do well for electric basses. Too few controls!                
great construction, although the noise level was high for a Boss pedal.                
Sorry, but cheaper pedals blow this unit out of the water!                
n/a; I didn't contact Boss.                
I purchased this in the hope that it would be good enough to use for a couple of acoustic guitar parts on stage. I used a strat and tried it both direct to pa and through a guitar amp.  There is so much digital fizz in this thing I feel it is unusable.  The fizz seem related to the top control - if you turn it down the fizz goes away, but so does the acoustic tone. Too bad because under the fizz you can sort of hear promising acoustic tones..Maybe the AC4 will correct this problem, but I sent mine back.                   
I have a few amps. I play primarily acoustic & I lead worship. There are times where I'm just by myself & then sometimes I have a full band. 
This amp is great! The very 1st time I lead with it, I got compliments on how good sound was. It can really help bring the whole mix to life if used right. I wouldn't trade it for anything else on the market. Just make sure you pick up the GA-FC to utilize all the sweet functions this amp has built in. Last suggestion: don't go over the top, use the effects to add to the sound & you're sure to have a better set!                
This pedal is OK.  If your into funky solos, this is not for you.  It is mainly for any songs that require wah the entire way.                  
It has tons of different combinations of sounds that are easy to create.  The worst part is when the battery runs out.                
its very durable and has good quality                
You dont HAVE to have it compared to some other wah pedals, but it is a fun box if your just messin' around.                
Overall this pedal is decent.  Not exactly Eric Clapton pedal, but its pretty fun to play with                
I purchased the Boss L2 Carry Bag for my new Boss GT-100. The unit fits snug as if designed for it specifically. Plenty of room, with the second storage compartment outside for cords or your extra "Gotta Have" stompbox, or both. Looks great. Seems well put together, but the one negative point.....the zippers seem OK, but time will tell. As far as Manufacturer support, I've dealt with Boss in the past, so I feel safe with their company.                
I bought this bag for my Helix LT and it fits perfectly what a great product at this price can't recommend it enough                
Great product! Bought for my Boss GT-8 and it fits well and my pedal is well-protected!                 
Designed for 3 Boss pedals, this definitely works well for my 2 pedals and AC adapter. I think it'd be pretty tight if you had 3 pedals. Keeping the pedals rigid makes transport and cable management much simpler, so it's a good match for me.                
The way the cover attaches and detaches is a little counter-intuitive, but I think that's a necessity of the design so that the pedals are positioned properly for use.                
It seems fine so far.                
It's probably a little expensive for the capacity, but there's virtually nothing else small out there. I hesitated a long time before purchasing it, but I'm glad I finally di.                
It definitely makes my life easier getting my gear ready to transport. (I'm not a professional musician, but go to a lot of jam sessions).                
Replace with same.                
sound depends on the pedals you use and settings. so its up to you                
has everything you need to get your pedals going. they pop in and out easy to allow disconnecting when you transport your equipment.                 
very easy to use top just pops off to let you get it out the way..                 
The quality is really good.                
a great value for the money!                
never needed any support                
If you have mostly Boss petals this is the case for you..                 
Got two of these and expect them to last for years.                
the unit does not add any noise interference that I can see...and I have 3 of them, chained together.                
This unit is great if you have a lot of Boss pedals; you may have trouble squeezing in pedals from different manufacturers.  That being said, the foam panels are easily removable to fit larger pedals, and a blank piece of foam is included in the kit, to custom cut for an odd shaped pedal.  I have a full sized EHX Metal Muff in one of my boards, and it fit just fine by removing the foam panel.  I have also added a Danelectro mini pedal to a full(6 Boss pedals)board, and it fit perfectly above and between 2 pedals...the board has a daisy chain with 8 connectors, so having more than 6 in the board wasn't a problem.  I don't tour, and my rig stays set up in my living room, so I can't comment on durability.  I will say, that contrary to what someone else mentioned, I don't have a problem "stomping" the pedals....  and I'm not a gymnast........                
as stated before, no extraneous noise.  One thing worth mentioning; though the unit comes with all the connector cables you need, DON'T LOSE THEM!!!!  The Boss cables are sort of propriatary ;  The pedals are spaced too close together to use most generic 6" connector cables!  one of the second hand boards I bought was missing a couple of cables, and after searching for months, I was finally able to find a couple that fit...for $15.00 each!!!!!.  So don't lose the Boss ones, and you won't have any trouble.                
IMHO, it's built like a tank, like other Boss products.  High impact plastic, thick inner foam to protect the pedals.  I bought one of my 3 boards from a touring musician, and it was none the worse for wear after 2 years use.                  
The price seems average to low for pedal boards.  Definately worth the money, and readily available on the used market for around $100.  But buy a new one from Zzounds.....ahem......                
Never had a problem, after owning dozens of Boss products over the years.                
are pedal boards sexy? hmmmmmmmm......                
As I mentioned; I have 3 of these pedal boards, chained together, with one filled with distortion boxes & looped through a noise gate; I have owned them, off and on, for 5 years, and aside from trying to find replacement 6" connector cables, I've had no problems at all.  If lost or stolen, I'd definately replace them with the same.....                
The is great. There is no in-line noise or interference that I've noticed.                
The Pedal board included all the accessories I needed to get started. It fits all manor of Boss pedals and even my Line6 Modules as well.                
The unit is very easy to get started on. Simple to hook up. It could stand to be a little larger. I can't fit all the pedals I would like to in it.                
This Pedal board is NOT very road worthy. I am professional musician who gigs two to three times a week. The first problem I had was the locking clasps. EVERYTHING is plastic, so it doesn't hold up to the abuses inflicted upon it from road use.                
If you are not a touring musician, this pedal board will probably work great. As I stated above, the sound quality and ease of use make it a practical unit for use at home or in a studio.                
To be honest, I don't know what the support is like. After the plastic locking clasp broke, I immediately started looking for a bigger & stronger unit.                
This pedal board does look very nice, especially with Boss pedals and Boss tuner in the top right corner. The cover panels along the top store all the wiring neatly.                
I am already searching for another product, only for the reliability issue. Plastic hardware doesn't last long on tour. It does have excellent sound quality, and it looks great, it just doesn't have the durability required for daily abuse.                
OK, the pedal case itself doesn't have any sound!  But I love the convenience of it.  I have 6 pedals and a tuner all set up in there and it is just so convenient to plug in and play.  PS, I have all Boss pedals except for a Korg tuner (which was on sale, too good to pass up) and they work really well.  I've used Boss pedals for almost 30 years and except for the ones that burned up in a fire, they still work really well.                
The power supply and input / output jacks are really convenient.  I can't think of anything else this might need.                
Very intuitive!                
As with all Boss products, it's fabulous.                
Compared to a flight case, this is pretty darn reasonable.                
Well, I really don't know, as I've never had to use customer support.                
I hope to keep this for years and years!                
Picked this up as a "blem" item for a great discount and I'll be darned if I can find a nick or scratch anywhere. Love the pedalboard with built in power that is hidden nicely to make for a clean set-up. I especially  like the unique foam molding that allows me to fit any size pedal, and I mean any from minature to huge, in it without using that horrible velcro tape that comes undone and ruins the value of the pedal for use alone on a floor or for resale. Love this pedalboard.                
It's a pedal board - It only sounds as good as the stuff you put in it .                
good - it's got everything required to make a decent board                
plug in and play                
good -- i like it                
yeah.                
everything works fine.                
it makes my set up time way faster .                
until i need more stuff and get a pedal board that will hold different voltages . it serves it's purpose right now !!                
Now that I have the case all set up, I love have everything in one place with portability. The only thing I would change on it it to make the top cover removable while playing. The case's lid is in the way.                
This is a poorly designed pedal board for the sole reason that the plastic case prevents you from stomping on your pedals effectively. It is too much of a ridge blocking access to the pedals. You almost have to hit the pedals from above with your toes. If you're looking for a pedalboard to effectively use while you're wearing sneakers, this is not the one.                 
This is a good product but the assembly of the cables requiires some patience and finesse. After making 12 cables, which took about an hour and a half, 7 worked and 5 did not. The only moving part is the set screw on each connector so after 2 hours more of loosening and tightening 5 of the 7 started to work. With 2 left i came to the realization that the problem was that the set screw some of the time was clamping down plenty tight but not piercing the outer coating on the cable so in order to make them work i would puncture the outside of the cable lightly so that the set screw would penetrate. All 12 are now working and I’m content. If you buy these be patient when you start to put them together. Try each cable before you set your board up.                
These went together much better than other kits I've tried. A couple of them took two attempts, but not bad. It seems like you have to be really careful to cut them straight. Any angle can screw up the connection.                
 I have tried other Boss overdrive/distortion pedals without coming away with the ooh ah factor tied to them...that is until now. All of you Fender Twin reverb amp owners take notice. This pedal will give your Twin the guts you never thought it had or could have without sounding pretentious.
  I have loved my Fender Twin from the day I bought it. But something was always lacking when it came to going crunch time. Granted I know Twins were not built at the time for harsher edgier types of music, But with the power and tone behind this amp I figured something has to sound good and natural without feeling too mismatched.
   For the longest time my Ibanez tube screamers seemed like the only pedals that gave my Twin any personality until now. The Blues Driver goes the extra mile where my Tube screamer only teased. Dont be fooled by the name of the pedal, it really does rock with my Twin volume at 3 and the pedal level at 9:00, tone at 11:00, and gain all the way up!                  
Boss has always had rugged pedals. The name of this one doesnt do it justice.                
The full gain sound is what sold me. I didnt think the lighter gain sounds were easy to dial in as the Tube screamer.                
I have never had a bad experience with a Boss product.                
  I think if the price was at about 59 bucks, I think they would be flying off the shelves. 79 bucks is abit too pricey for an overdrive pedal.                
n/a                
 The sound is what sells this pedal. My Twin thanks Boss. But change the name of the pedal and lower the price a couple bucks.                
   This pedal will now be the major stomp box for my recordings as well as on stage.                
This really boosts the tone for tube amps and has superb distortion.                 
The product didn't include any accessories, but it didn't need it. It has everything you need and nothing you don't.                
Built like a piece of armor.                 
A great price for a very useful and I'm sure it'll last me very long.                
Wouldn't know, but i'm assuming its good.                
Makes you sound great.                
Overall, a great weapon in the arsenal.                
this pedal makes my small 15w amp gain sustain and makes it range greatly in sound                
simple knobs, but thats all you need to get a good tone out of the pedal                
very well built, metal casing makes this effect last a long time.                
very worth while investment in my arsenal. I would be willing to pay about $80 for this product.                
wouldn't know, never had to deal with them, but i'm sure its good.                
reproduces a very smooth and hypnotizing sound for blues playing.                
Very easily controlled and very durable pedal.                
Terrific pedal, sounds great with my Laney or Marshall amp, along with my Gibson Les Paul Axcess Standard. You'll get heavy distortion out of the device but, depending on how you adjust this pedal, it's great for a crunch and, a bit of a bite too. You can use it from medal to blues.                 
well, the bd-2 is a must for blues players like me. it makes your licks stand out clear. however, the blues driver doesn't sound that rich when doing chords.                
one thing, you can go from overdriven to crunch to clean with your guitar volume.                 
i got mine six years ago. not a single problem                
this is my most important stomp box                
The sound is good with this pedal.  Takes a bit of adjusting to get a sound you might like.  I fould that the level pot to be touchy.  It seems to be either all on or basicly all off.                  
It has the usual features found BOSS pedals.                
Made like a tank.  Hard to beleive that one could ever damage it.                
Good value for the price                
Never had to deal with support.  I've heard that the BOSS support sucks                
With the touchy level pot I have I have stopped using it in my setup and have switched to Digi-Tech 'Bad Monkey.'  I will keep this as a backup.  I hope to do the Keeley upgrades.  
I probably would not replace it as I think that the tone of the Digi-Tech is cleaner.                
The true potential of this pedal can only be achieved by fine tuning the settings. It can add a very pleasant warmth to a tube amp sound but tends to get harsh if the setting are set too high. Time spent experimenting with the settings is worthwhile.                
It sounds great.  My first pedal, and it's still in the line up.                
The basic 3 knobs. But it provides tons of versatality.                
Sturdy as hell. It's a Boss.                
Good price as well.                
This is a bad ass pedal for all types of guitar styles. Crank the gain and get a nice distortion.  Turn it down for a resemblence of SRV's sound. Then just tweak the tone knob. Oh!, and battery life is sufficient too. You almost dont need an adapter.  If you are interested in this thing, just buy it.                
A high quality crunchy sound. Gives you that great "AC/DC style" blues rocky sound.                 
Didn't come with necesarry cords to use it.                
It's a Boss, what else do I have to say?                
Worth it!                
Looks great! That nice blue and black combo looks good.                 
I will be satisfied with the pedal untill it breaks. Which will most likely be a very long time from now.                
Ive bought a ton of "boutique" pedals at all price points. And this pedal by far sounds better and is more versatile than any Ive had . From a slight overdrive to a high gain distortion without getting fuzzy                  
Has way more capability than I have time to fiddle with. I use it mostly on very low depth and rate settings to give a chorus type fill in sound.                
Lots of control available. Standard BOSS casing so it matches up great with the MT-2 in my pedal string.                
Takes some fiddling to get things set just right. What do you expect from a stompbox with this much crammed in though?                
It's BOSS. What more do you need?                
I rated it at a "5" simply because I bought it when I lived in Australia and I feel I paid too much for it.                
N/A                
Very sexy purple color with a two tone LED in it that flashes?? That's frikkin HOT!                
It sounds good together with my other Boss effects units. The sound is more effective for me, especially if it is goes through the Drive Channel in my Marshall amp. it work also good in clean channel but its more effective in drive channel as what I've observe, Its kind of more detailed modulated sound. I have also a Boss Phaser and Tremolo pedal which works also great in same way. I love Boss modulation effects it creates more creativity and music style in my guitar playing.  
Variety of cool modes including new features which make your music style sick!                 
In Boss Quality.. There's only two words: WE TRUST! It will trully last like most other Boss pedals.                 
Compare to other brands Boss usually are way up on their prices. We should remember that most of the times Price and Quality goes together. As long it will last thats the most important thing. For me this pedal is really worth it, if it is priced a hundred even.                  
Never tried so far..                
For the music style I play I difinitely need this effect.                
Its only Boss and Digitech are my main brand in effects units, never tried other brands so far. The Boss BF-3 is one of its kind more usefull modes, make great flanging sound I'm highly satisfied with it.                   
Great sound if ur looking for crazy flanger. Lots of control over the sound. It sounds a bit better than the digitech hyper flanger in my opinon. Like most boss stompboxes the sound is a bit sterile but awesome.                
Its got good features.                
Its boss so its built like a rock. I've had a Mt-2 Metal Zone for 4 yrs and its been like a brick.                 
The price is a bit much but its worth it. I got mine for $180 (CAN). It was a bit more than the digitech 1 but in the long run it was better.                
I had to get my Metal Zone repaired once and its was fastish (took a week or so) and well done. Never actually had to deal with boss.                 
I bough it.                
I can safely say that this pedal will bring me years of joy. Its Great!                
I like it gives you lots of recording options and features. very solidly built too if you.are a guitarist like me you will love it it has a lot of guitar friendly features. Very portable unit can go anywhere I say it's a good buy and boss equipment is quality so if you want a "guitarist" friendly device this is the one. Has a lot of features so there is a learning curve but with how to video instruction and detailed instruction book it's not to bad to figure out. Well worth the price and well you know zZounds is best I order music equipment from no one else.....unit came well packed and few days. Go ahead get one if you want as close to a real studio quality as possible recorder.                
My set up is my travel guitar a mini elec guitar with short neck , br 80, and auxiliary input for the car speaker, When my wife goes shopping with my little grand kids, I can't go with them because of my bad knee, I stay inside the car set up my guitar to my Boss Micro Br 80, connect the line out to the built in auxiliary line input of my car and I thank Toyota Camry Le for having an auxiliary input besides the USB port and Bluetooth there she goes the sounds out to the car speakers, and I have a monitor speaker beautiful sounds immersing inside the car wow outstanding, thank you Boss                
this is a incredible unit jam packed with features im a singer in a rock band and this is such a handy thing to have. i use it to record practices, recording, any live show, writing & recording new songs. the built in mics are very good condenser mics very powerful just set it in the room close to the live sound and you get a quality recording. and its so easy to use you will be doing cool stuff with it in minutes. I'm very pleased                
It might be a nice recorder, but I could not figure out how to use the thing. I read the book and watched some U-Tube instruction videos, but it just did not work for me. I sent it back. zZounds was great about the return. I will buy from them again.                
I ordered the SG on Monday, around noon by phone , FedEx delivered it to my home THE NEXT DAY!!  after setup the guitar is absolutely beautiful.  Monthly payments made it possible for me to own this great guitar! I purchased a boss portable recorder prior the the SG, and I'm equally happy with that. I LOVE Zzounds!!                
My last experience with a multi-track recorder was a four track tape recorder from many years ago. The sound was awful and it had a lot of limitations. The BR-800 sounds simply amazing.                 
The BR-800 comes with a power adapter, a USB cable and a DVD with software including Sonar, a WAV converter and a rhythm editor. I play the guitar and with the BR-800 I feel like I can express my potential. It's almost like having a band in a box. I really like the wheel to select the various options although it takes a bit to get used to it and I definitely like the touch sensors (no clicking noises).                
I was impressed with how easy it was to start recording. The first few days I just toyed with it and managed to record a song using all the tracks with barely a glance to the manual. Then I started studying the manual as well and found it well written although lacking on certain issues (like mixing and mastering).                 
The BR-800 seems definitely well put together but I am not sure how well it would handle the "on the road" treatment. For one thing, it's extremely light (which is obviously a plus as far as portability is concerned) but be careful not to trip in any of the cables or the whole recorder is going to fly off the desk. In my case, I don't really plan to use this much out of the house so no big deal. The other thing is that the top part of the case has a really nice finish to it but shows all the fingerprints and really attracts quite a bit of dust (and with touch sensors there will be plenty of fingerprints).                 
I did quite a bit of research before purchasing the BR-800. I considered older used Boss products and new similar ones (Zoom, etc.). For my kind of situation this seemed like the best value. Now, after 40 some days, I can say that I am totally satisfied with sound and quality.                 
I just called support for a question about a problem with the SD card. The response of the very laid back person (way too laid back in my opinion) was pretty much "dude, the SD card is your problem because it's media so go buy another one". Not really what you would expect from a company after you spend several hundred dollars on their product. Hopefully, they are better when it comes to actual technical support.                 
As I said before, it's a band in a box. I wish stuff like this was around 20 years ago.                 
I will keep this around for as long as it lasts. I am really having a blast!                
This recorder is great.It is easy to use and records quite well.I use it to record live practices and it sounds great.                
Easy record function is great. With the push of a button you can start recording. Just follow the instrustions and you are on your way!                
If you read the manual, setting it up for use through your computer is a snap. It comes with Cakewalk Sonar and getting the two to funtion together is also a snap.                
It seems to be made rather well. All sliders and buttons work great. It is however very light weight. Seems as though it would break rather easily. But since it hasn't, I am quite surprised.                
Well woth the money. It has tons of guitar bass and vocal affects as well as being a top notch recorder.                
 I have not dealt with support because I hsve hsd no reason too.....yet!                
Its just a cool gadget!                
I expect to use it a long time. Thats why I bought it. And yes if it were stolen I would replace it. Couldn't imagine having to write songs without it.                
I purchased a BR 800 a few days ago. ZZOUNDS did a great job on processing and shipping. The BR 800 is amazing. It is user friendly and has an immense amount of features. I now have a home studio that is so easy to use on the go as well. I believe I will enjoy it for years to come.                
THIS BOSS BR800 IS "BOSS" ! Works very well. I am a retired history teacher just getting into music. I use the BR-800 making reciordings of my performances on an electronic keyboard. EASY to Use, outstanding results. I Am very happuy with it. GREAT PRICE and zZounds shipped it to me VERY QUICKLY!                
I bought this item for my husband and he is amazed how a little product could have the sound that it does. The Boss BR-800 has exceeded his expectations. He teaches children guitar lessons and they play in churches and the Boss BR-800 has all the capabilities to record their music and then they can take the Boss BR-800 with them when they perform and it allows them to have music plus what each one of the children play. The Boss BR-800 is great and I am so proud that I was able to purchase the product thru ZZ Sounds payment plan. Thank You!                
The Boss BR-800 came with a 2GB card which holds alot of music and makes it so easy to record what you need. It also comes with a USB cord which is made to only fit the Boss BR-800 which is great. With the USB cord it allows you to download all of the recorded music and put it on your computer.                 
The Boss BR-800 is amazing with the way that it sounds when you playback what you have recorded. The sounds is so clear and sounds just like you were in a big recording studio. The manual was easy to read and it walked you thru each step to take in recording the music. The Boss BR-800 is just easy to use as long as you read your manual before trying to operate the product.                
Boss has always made a great product and when I purchased this for my husband I knew that I was getting a great product. The Boss BR-800 has meet our expectations (really went beyond our expectations) and my husband has been able to record the music that he needs when he and the children he teaches goes out to perform in churches. This is a great product and Thank You ZZ Sounds for allowing me to use the payment plan.                
The Boss BR-800 is worth every penny. My husband did alot of research on the products that he needed and The Boss was the one that did everything that he needed for his music.                
This Boss BR-800 is compact, but yet it has the power and prestige of any higher priced product on the market. If any is looking for a product that will give you great performance, amazing sound, and will do just about everything that you need to make a professional sounding CD or any type of music that you want to use anywhere. It's great!!!                
The Boss BR-800 is all that my husband needs. If he needed another product it would be a Boss. The Boss BR-800 is compact in size, but it is very powerful. It will meet anyone expectations, so check it out and enjoy!                
This unit sounds great right out of the box . many choices of effects amps etc...  cosm sounds great. as do the drums but wish i could do more with them. i mostly play metal and the hi gain amp sounds official.combine that with a drum arrangement that you add the intro  fills and ending to(but is pretty limited) add a bass line using your guitar if you dont have a bass guitar around and you can be a one man army. playing, recording, editing , mixing and mastering then use your computer to convert to wav. file and burn cd                
as im sure youve read the item description this unit has lots of features.i must say i love the touch buttons . bigger brighter screen is a plus . easy enough menu interface  drum selection and editing kinda limited which is why i gave it a 9 but is good enough and sound great plus comes with cool software thats also a plus                
although it is easy enough to use normally ,e z rec , or song sketch , you may need to keep manual close by for other stuff. but thats not a bad thing .it does alot! i was a newbie to the recording process and now im making awesome music that sounds like it was recorded in a studio with expensive equipment                
i think boss makes quality stuff and this is br 800 is no different                
i believe you get what you pay for and this purchase was well worth it in my opinion                
i have had no issues yet ,but i know roland/boss.us have great  customer support                 
pretty slick looking                
overall an awesome unit i would recommend to anyone looking for a multi-track unit                
Love my boss br800 multitrack digital recorder!!! Very user friendly!!!                 
It Depends on your instruments and chords but the sound qualities good.  I know it would sound so much clearer if Boss would just let the recorder record in WAV format instead of the HIFI MT thing. You can only use WAV format in sketch mode which I don't like.  
If BOSS made an updated firmware that would let you choose between HIFI or WAVE format for the main recording section that would be be awesome!                
Everything in effects you need:  guitar effects (GT-10). Bass simulator, Vocal effects (ve-20), acoustic simulator
Recording 4 at one time is better than just 2, but 8 is great                
Very easy to use with EZ recording mode. Gread manual too                
Beautiful but sometimes i feel like I have to be as gentle as if im holding a baby its so light                
To me it should be like 349.99(because only 4 channels recording)or 399.99 like the zoom.                
Boss is great with Support on their website                
I really like the touch sensitive buttons and large screen                
I thinks its great for recording demos, and for if you don't have any effect processors or other people to record with. As for recording live music of a full band and singers its not that good. Boss needs to change the Boss(Hifi) format to uncompressed Wav recording like the Zoom to get the best  clear sound. 
Maybe if Boss would make a downloadable "update" that allows you to use the "sketch book" wave format for regular recording with ALL 4 CHANNELS instead of 2 it would be better. But this is a Good recorder                
Great sound, from really watery effects to crazy fast modulation.    Perfect for what I do.  I use it with keyboards and theremin, too.  Makes for some great noises when coupled with heavy delay and some distortion.  My only complaint is that it makes a low hum with the low filter turned even half way up.                
It would be nice if it came with an adapter because it does drain batteries FAST.  Otherwise features are good.                
The high filter knob has bent a little bit, but it doesn't really effect performance.  I've had it for 10 years now and it hasn't fallen apart.  Boss makes tough pedals.                
Don't remember what I paid, but I've never regretted buying it.  I can't live without a chorus pedal.                
Don't know, never talked to them.  Maybe I should about that hum.                
I like the look of Boss pedals, but that's not the most important factor here now is it?                
Like I said, my only complaint is that hum with the low filter dial turned up.  Maybe there's a way to remedy that?
If I had to replace it, I would probably look at other models.  Before I bought it I also tried the Boss Super Chorus, but the Chorus Ensemble definitely had the better sound.                
I have been using Boss pedals since long time but i did not tried their chorus as i already had a Ibanez one. So when i plugged it in my amp it just sounded superb. It even produce brillant sound in mono setting. It has got everything which a guitarist wants. Sound is clean, rich and amazingly beautiful. It is something i have been missing since so many years. I am completely satisfied with it. It gives good sound if it is being used with distortion.                  
The best feature it has got is the low and high filters which gives you complete control over your desired sound. The pedal is very rugged and the variable knobs are very smooth and quiet. The unit is simply one of the best constructed.                
It is very easy to shape any sound from this unit. It also very simple to mix it with other effects and does not cause any trouble. The manual is very clear and it also stated all the famous settings for various sound productions.                
The unit is very strong and very well made. But its paint finishing seems a little dull. I used it on the road and it is completely reliable. Overall its quality is great.                 
I think the price is a little higher. People now a days perfer to buy the complete effect boards so consequently these individual pedals prices should be reduced to let the hobbiest to get them more easily.                
Never had a problem with their units so far.                
It is a perfect addition to my effect pedal libary. After buying it i can't think to play my guitar without it.                
No i would not change it. I will buy same another one if it being stolen. It surely complements all my musical targets. The best thing is its sound quality and least is its paint finishing quality it is rather dull.                
excellent sound, really brightens up your clean tone, i dont ever use it when playing with distortion but im sure it can keep up with it. I can really hear the difference between playing with a chorus pedal and going completely dry signal clean. I couldnt imagine playing anything clean without chorus just because this pedal adds so much more beautiful tonalites to your tone.                 
5 control knobs, perfect for honing in the sound your looking for, anything from wickedly liquid chorus to something very small and faint sounding                 
Its a boss, so obviously just plug and play. They give you a few examples in the instruction guide which are great but more so better for you seeing how exactly the pedal works and what does what, then from that being able to find your own sound                
ive owned a boss pedal for almost 6 years now and it hasnt broken so i entrust this one to stay put for just as long                 
its nice and cheap, though i traded in my old wah for this so i didnt pay a cent, but its still only like 119 bucks canadian                
Havent had to deal with them, boss products are top of the line they'll never break                
its baby blue, looks like any other boss pedal so it fits in nicely on the ol pedalboard with the rest of em. Made of metal so its gonna be able to take a stompin.                 
As far as im concerned i wont ever need another chorus pedal, if it breaks i'll buy another one just like it. It suits all my needs ive never been limited by what it can or possibly cannot do, absolutely perfect for chorus. Go out an buy it if your lookin for chorus, its lush.                 
This Pedal is a good replacement for the infamous CE2 Chorus.
It responds well and has a very wide range of controlls to get about any chorus sound you would ever need.                
Typical Boss pedal easy to access the battery compartment.                
Very durable. Used Boss when was on the road touring. Very road worthy.                
Yes great price                
Never had to contact them.                
excellent                
Ill use Boss products indefinantly                
very flexible tone and sound. i love it                
great sound and controls, wish it came with an ac adapter cause it just uses up batteries so fast. adapters cost 20 bucks                
sturdy metal, this thing wont break unless you are trying to break it and if it does, there is a 5 yar warranty                
worth every penny you paid. does what it should                
i havent had any problems, but im sure they would give me my five year warranty                
this field really doesnt apply mich to pedals but umm i guess it looks cool                
i dont plan on replacing it. it is a prfessional level pedal that sounds great and is made well.                
it's sound is perfect for anyone looking for a chorus pedal. the 5 knobs give you the control for the sound you want.i voe the sound on it.                
like i said i love the sound on it it'll just be like it's suposed to and it just awsome. the babey blue color is pretty cool too.                
this is a Boss so DUH it's gonna be really easy to you just plug it in and play your heart out.                
like i said its a Boss it's never broken yet and iv'e been useing it for 6 years!                
it's a great deal for someone looking for there first chorus. i know it is.                
Never had to fix a thing.                
its babey blue is a cool touch and it feels great when you play it,even if your on the go.                
I LOVE THIS PEDAL! its sutch an awsome pedal great deal and great for someone looking for there first chorus pedal.                
sounds like its supposed to and you can get just about every chorus sound you want                
the 5 knobs give you the settings you want your chorus to sound like.plus it was a little smaller than expexted but still awsome                
Really easy to use.                
i never expect this product to break and i got it 2 days ago.                
perfect price for a perfect pedal                
never had to call for support                
i think this is a realy good pedal for beggeners and pros!                
i love this pedal its just awsome                
Sound just what I wanted. Smooth, warm and clean. I really love it especially in clean tunes sounds like it float in the sky while you do the plucking or strumming.                
It has five knobs all the of them are usefull really makes a difference. If you turn the "RATE" knob all way up it also creates some sort of vibrato effect.                  
BOSS pedals are gonna last long thats why I like them.                
Dont hesitate to buy this one really worth it.                
Overall Im empressed with this pedal and Im damn glad proud I choose Boss CE-5. Sound + quality + value = BOSS CE-5                
I think this is a great chorus pedal, given I am not a huge huge chorus person, but works great for what i want it for. I am also not using this stereo.                
I havent had any problems dialing in the exact sound i want out of this pedal. 4 knobs are perfect for getting the right chorus sound                
Really easy. Just plug in and play, dialing in what you want is easy also.                
Boss builds there stuff like tanks. Solid metal construction, you could toss this thing off your roof and i would bet it will still work like it's out of the box.                
If your a huge chorus pedal person, im sure there is a nicer sounding one out there, and ive heard the older boss pedals give off more of a vintage sound, but for me this pedal is just fine.                
Never had problems with this pedal, but ive dealt with boss/roland for other things and they have a good support team. They where fast and helped me out accuratly.                
I like the look of boss pedals. Very uniform and look great.                
Im very satisfied with this pedal. I like to use it to just give my guitar a little bit of character while playing on cleam.                
I absolutely LOVE the sound I get from my CH-1! I have an older Black label model that I got at least 15-16 years ago and I have never had ANY problems with mine! I don't really use it for chorus though, I set it's volume level all the way up, EQ at about "3" O'clock, Rate at "9" O'clock and Depth all the way up and I get a really sweet, warm fat sound that I didn't have without this pedal! I use mine with a BOSS FV-50H two-channel volume pedal and simply send the CH-1's output-A to input-1 on the volume pedal and the CH-1's output-B to the volume pedals input-2, than each output on the volume pedal goes to each Marshall head.                
Owned it. Sold it. SOund is 'crisp' but that = harsh to my ears ..                
Features matter not if sound is poor - go for an old CE-2 or even a CE-3 if you want stereo outputs ..                
Boss is always reliable - I have many boss pedals.  Thisi s perhaps the only one I never liked ..                
Not good value if sound no good                
Don't know - never needed them                
no thanks                
didn't like it at all - CE-2, CE-3, small clone are all much better ...                
the sound using this pedal with bass is absolutely amazing if u want a little edge on ur playing, it will blow you out of the water the first time you use it.                
I used my friends when I played with it,but im gettin my credit card out right now to buy one for myself.                
It has no sound of its own, it just brings out your guitar's tone in a simple, effective manner.                
The Sustainer aspect of this pedal performs amazingly well for the price range. At higher settings, though, you may need a noise gate at the end of your effects chain.                
It's a Boss Pedal. Great quality ... easy as pie.                
Absolutely made well. I've had mine for many years and it still holds out like a tank.                
It's very much worth its price. You could spend tons more on a boutique item, but you'll hear very little difference.                
Never had to use Manufacturer Support.                
At the front of my effects chain, this thing tames the peaks while delivering smooth, amazing tone.                
Let's face facts - your sound is incomplete without compression somewhere in the mix. You could spend anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a several thousand dollars on rack gear and great effects, but if there's no compression in there it's like a new tire with a pin-hole leak in it. Your sound isn't airtight.This Boss pedal gives you that element in a simple, affordable package and brings it all together like the salt in your stew. And it does so amazingly well. I have two other rack compressors, but this pedal gives me a much greater mobility and versatility without compromising my sound.It really shines when you run it into your amp clean, with no other effects engaged. Just your naked guitar, neither too loud nor too soft.Beautiful!                
I'm a novice guitar player. After watching YouTube reviews on the Boss CS-3, I decided to give one a try. It certainly wasn't love at first sight. The sound coming from my tube amp after I plugged the CS-3 in for the first time was a BIG change that took a while to get used to. The highs and lows coming from my amp were noticeably compressed, but my wildly erratic picking dynamics suddenly became more controlled as well. YouTube reviews suggest that this compressor is rather heavy-handed, but that's exactly what I needed at this juncture.Give one a try. I think you'll see why a compressor appears on the pedal boards of many, if not most, current professional guitarists. My 4.5-star rating is based solely on the fact that I've never used another compressor, so I have nothing to compare it to. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my CS-3.                
This is exactly what I was looking for.It performs well and adds the sonic flavor that I was looking for.Much better htan my Dunlop                
Sustainnnnnnnnnnnnnn                
twist a knob and get immediate response                
built like a tank                
The price is spot on                
I.ve never had o deal with Boss/Roland directly.They have a lot of info on their site                
It's the first pedal in my line up and the first one I step on                
It does what it does very well.No need to replace it                
it gives a great feel when your playing. I play rock/metal and I heard Synyster used it, so i tried it at guitar center, and it's just what I've been looking for                
i just tried it out.                
it's perfect, and anyone who wants a shreddin' hard rock sound should get one.                
get a Marshall amp to go with it.                
it's under priced, it's too awesome to bee $90.00                
I have other BOSS products, but this is my favorite.                
It would be better in black, dark blue, or red.                
I'm gonna use it, marry it, do it, and honestly die with it. [HAHA]                
This has to be the worst compression/sustain pedal on the market. Was not impressed with this piece of Taiwan junk. It is more of a volume pedal if anything. I dumped it soon after I bought it and sprung for the Janglebox Compression/Sustain pedal. Which by the way is built in the USA. You only get what you pay for.                 
Sounds awesome when you get the pefect sound you want.                
You can get lots of sounds from smooth dynamics to a killer boost.                
Built Like A Tank                
This peddal is overall great for what I use It for. If I had to By it again, I would.                
Like the other reviews say, this only takes a few minutes to figure out, I didn't need to read the instructions. I plan on using this to try to learn to play in odd meter, as well as get my basic timing working well. For odd meter, you set the "beat" setting for "3-4" to count in 7/8 (or 7/4) time, with accents on the 1 and 4 beats, that sort of thing. Or you can set it to "4-3" if that suits you. The "rhythm" setting does quarter notes, 8th notes (two tied together - I'm still learning music, not sure what those are called), 8th rest and 8th note, triplets (I think that's what you call that), and others. If I knew the correct terminology, I could tell you what they are - hopefully you're better with music theory than I am! It also has two clave rhythms, no idea what those are yet (but I plan on looking it up after I do this review). The battery is a 3 volt CR2032, like the ones used in most motherboards in computers, and it comes with one installed, so it's ready to use right out of the box. There's also a 1/8" headphone jack, so I can plug it into my bass practice amp (haven't tried that yet). This is my first metronome, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I think it's all I'll ever need. I got this based on the reviews, and that was a good move!                
This thing is small, compact and has more features than you would think.                
The tone is pleasant enough, but easily cuts through a piano sound.                
Just right for most music students.  If there were many more features, it would be more complicated.                
Five minutes with the instruction sheet, and you'll be able to dial up any rhythm you'll need.                
Seems to be well put together, and is easy on batteries.                
It's a good value for any music student.                
I'll use this as long as it lasts.                
Pleasant to listen to for long periods of time.                 
You can adjust where the accents go, as well as the subdivision of each beat. It has tap tempo and even a tuner which will play all 12 pitches; you can adjust the reference tone (440 is the default, of course). There's a volume control which comes in handy, as well as a headphone jack.                
Spend 5 minutes with it, and you'll figure it out. Pretty straightforward. More features than a typical metronome, maybe, but not hard to figure out how to do everything you want.                
I like the digital metronome arm and overall aesthetics, as well as the compact size.                
I'd say this metronome is where it's at for most people. It does more than just click at a given BPM, having accents and subdivisions such as eighths, sixteenths, triplets, clave patterns, and more. You could go with one of the more elaborate DB models if you are looking for actual beats instead of just a click (I'm not familiar with these models). But for most people, I would venture that you will be satisfied with the features on the DB-30.                
Exactly what you would expect from a Digital Delay Pedal.                 
The medium and long delay times are marvelous for my purposes. It's easy to find the balance you need between the effect level, the feedback, and the delay time. I have yet to figure out the hold feature, but that is a minor gripe.                
An incredibly wide range of sounds can be made with this pedal. Once you experiment a little with each knob, you can easily find the one you're looking for.                
This is a Boss pedal. Need I say more?                
If money is tight, this may not be the one for you. There are other delay pedals that run cheaper. But this product delivers on every penny you pay for on both sound and build quality.                 
I have no experiences with support (I haven't needed it).                
This pedal looks and feels like every other boss pedal I've used, but it's a formula that works. The physical design isn't breaking any boundaries, but it's what's inside that counts.                
I was looking for a digital delay pedal that could create ambient, sound-wave like effects heard in music like 'This Will Destroy You' and 'Mogwai'. I trust Boss quality, listened to some demos on YouTube, and decided on this. I'm incredibly happy with my purchase. If you listen to post-rock and are looking for a similar sound, you cannot go wrong with the DD-3.                
There are some great settings on the DD-3, and once you find them, you will find yourself hitting them nearly every time you solo or go into a punchy rhythm section.  Still, the DD-3 is digital, although a warm digital, and cannot replace a good analog delay.  There is a place for both in many rigs, but the DD-3 is a great digital delay no doubt.                
Lacks a tap tempo, and I find the hold function useless; but, then again it has all the essential settings.                
Easy to dial in a great delay sound in every time frame.  Don't be afraid to turn up the level knob, as it is a bit low from 0 to 50%.                
It's Boss quality, and Boss pedals have always been dependable for me.                
Here is where all pedals lose in my opinion.  All pedals are over priced for what they are.  But the DD-3 specifically is fair, if a bit overpriced.                
Never had to call for support.                
More of the pros I look up to have this pedal than do not have it.                
The DD-3 has the right qualities where it counts, even if it is a bit low on features and price, it is still staying on my pedalboard, which is tough as I only use 3 pedals.                
sounds good and is noisefree.                
for a pedal has a lot of features.                
well made. no back up for me. roadworthy.                
n/a only visited their website.                
attractive looks                
works great                
I haven't had enough expierence with different delay pedals to compare this with others.
I did have a modeling amp with built in delay and I can say for sure this one sounds 100-times better.
I have this set up in my amps effect loops and it wrks perfectly.                
Has all the delay fetures I could possibly need for rythum and solo work.
Built like a tank.                
It takes a little while to learn all you can do with this pedal. But that is half the fun.                
I am impressed with how well made Boss pedals are. I have tried a few other here and there and nothing seems to compare.                
For the price I don't think you can get a more well made nice sounding delay pedal.                
n/a                
Boss pedals always look great too!                
This pedal will last me forever. If it were stolen I would go out and get another one right away.
For me this pedal has all the featuers I will ever need and none that will go unused.                
Not exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for an echo sound at the end of the last note or chord. The pedal does great delay. Maybe, I need to look more into the directions or a different type of pedal.                
I use it on all my solos, i cant play my solos without this, very very clean delay                
Just a simple delay                
fantastic quality, the delay sounds terrific                
The best amount of money i paid for an effect                
the thing that appeals me to this pedal is quality and reliability, else i dun have any other BOSS pedals in my setup                
I would be keeping this for good                
Did some research and chose this guy for use with my Bass guitar. I needed something versatile, reliable, and easy to manage. We play with in-ear monitors and a click track so every song has specific timing for things. I wanted a delay I could dial in the timing to a specific BPM and choose which note is getting the delay beat. And here I introduce the DD-500 - Boom Son! Sounds great with Bass guitar, countless options and capabilities, quick learning curve, ability to save tons of settings and pull them up quickly while on stage. Everything from super tight punchy delay sounds, to that washed out muddy swirling sound you can use for intro and outro bits.
Stunning. Why buy something else when you could have the  Millennium Falcon.

zZounds is amazing! great customer service, thank you for the ease of payment option if needed, and for timely deliveries!!                  
The sound is decent overall, some modes sound better than others.
My last two delays were a Flashback and before that an EchoPark and this pedal sounds better than either and, offers TONS more functionality. 
I don't care for the sound of the Shimmer mode, this is one of the few areas where I feel that the DD-500 really falls short of its closest competitors. 
I could do without the Terra Echo too. 
Instead of an effects loop for the repeats, it has built in effects that you can add to the repeats within the unit. Aside from the modulations, I don't care for most of the effects and would have much rather had an effects loop.
Don't get me wrong though, I am VERY pleased with this pedal.
I mainly use the Standard and Analog modes and they sound just fine and are worth the price of admission alone.                
This is where this pedal really impresses.
This things has ten times more functionality than I will ever use.
The real genius of this design is that you can either walk right up to it and twist knobs and get a good basic sound quick and easy or you can go into the deep editing and let your imagination run wild.
Seriously, this thing is only limited by how much time you want to spend tinkering with it.
The manual manages to be BOTH huge and worthless, a common theme among Roland's more complicated products and, believe me, this pedal CAN get complicated if that's what you want.
The ONLY feature I would like to see that was omitted would be an effects loop.                   
This pedal can be adjusted pretty easily but, if ease of use is a serious concern of yours, I would probably just look at something else entirely.                
My last two digital delays both went out within 2-3 years and, THAT was my main motivator in choosing a Boss product. Many people I have owned and played lots of Boss and Roland products over the decades and they have consistently been some of the most reliable music products I have ever seen.
I have only owned this pedal a few months so, I can't really speak to it's reliability at this point but, I am optimistic about it.                
This is obviously subjective.
The truth is, I would have probably been just fine with the DD-7 at half the price....
BUT!
zZounds make it so darned easy to treat yourself with their awesome payment plans,...so why not?!!?
In comparison to pedals like the Timeline, Time Factor, Flashback X4, etc... I think the DD-500 offers the most options for the money. The reputation of Boss and Roland products also makes me more confident to spend this kind of money on a pedal.
I think it is money well spent.                
Never needed to contact Roland before. The manuals are terrible though.                
I think that this pedal is terribly ugly. They should have hit is with that snazzy black metal flake paint job that's on the the Boss RV-6.                
A top shelf multi-delay that is a bit more affordable than it's competition.                 
Well, I've had this for right at a week now. I cannot even begin to explain just how versatile this delay is. If you're on a budget, it could even do chorus and reverb in a pinch (not the best chorus or reverb, but decent), but what this thing excells at is out of this world unique delay sounds. It can do all your standard delays, and it can do them very well for a digital reproduction of them. The only one that I'm not completely satisfied with is the tape delay mode. Its decent for sure, but nowhere near as good as a stand alone tape delah repro. The rest of them, well I would challenge anyone to tell the difference between the dd500 and what theyre trying to emulate. A very seasoned pro maybe able to, but your average dude I'm the crowd wouldn't be able to tell the difference for sure. The value here is truly unparalleled. What you're getting is the highest fidelity delay on the market, and a delay that is capable of almost anything you could possibly want and a whole lot that you never even realized you wanted, lol. This unit has a few delays that are even unique to boss that you wouldn't find in another brand. The tera echo, shimmer, and sfx modes are delays that you would spend well over 300 dollars for on their own if you wanted to get the same sound with stomp boxes. The many presets on here are amazing. I could probably just sit there all day switching between them and creating riffs to match each unique mode. You can also create a near endless amount of your own patches as well, with extreme tweakability on nearly every parameter. If you're the type that just wants to plug and play though, Thats not a problem either, with nearly 200 presets that range from classic to insane, you can just jam away without having to bend down and tweak knobs, while using nearly the full range of this unit. I have never been more satisfied with a gear purchase than I am with this. I'm not usually a fan of digital effects or multi effects units at all, because the quality suffers with the versatility. Most of them do a lot of things but none of them well. This thing does a lot of things and all of them well. Very well even. I am sure that I will still be experimenting and finding new sounds for years to come with this. What else can you pay 300 dollars for and get that many hours of joy from?! You get the standard delays we all know and love, and easy accessibility also, to make this a gigging machine. Once you get home to your bedroom or studio, it doubles as the ultimate experimental oddity of a pedal. I would buy this over and over again, though I'm sure it'll last as its built like a tank. So, if you're looking for a versatile delay, or you're unfamiliar with delay and dont know what you like, don't hesitate to buy this pedal. I couldn't see anyone regretting it.                
I do not think anyone could forge an argument that this is not the delay of choice for $300. I find it has the features I need and actually does things others do not. Once you get in there and really tweak on the modes and param adjusts you are going to find it can do what you want and maybe more so. 
Things that are important to me are bandwidth fidelity, processing quality, multiple modes of delays, a phrase looper, an all important actual ms readout, and presets.
Nothing really has more than this unit, an A/B of 99 banks is certainly more than you can use. You can get into this and get it to do just a flange or chorus sound, so many cool delays just waiting to be tweaked in to ones sonic ideal. I am not really a fan of Boss and this is the 1st Boss pedal I have messed with in ages, but this is new level of design and quality that not only competes with higher priced units but in some ways give them more than a run for the money. 
Sure Nemesis is a great delay but no readout, how do you know where the proper ms or interval of a 5th is if you can't see it, put a tuner after the delay, guess? All the benefits of a Strymon flagship and a few things like Terra, and SPX it does not offer. Well worth the price tag. The Delay of choice for my opinion.                 
I had been wanting one of these pedals for a long time and zZounds enabled me to get it with their Play As You Pay Program. The DD7 is everything I thought it would be. It is easy to use and has great sound. I play mainly 60's & 70's Classic Rock and The Shadows and Ventures. The DD7 helped me to get that fantastic Hank Marvin sound on my Strat that I also purchased from zZounds.com. zZounds is great and is the best online music store there is. They have came through every time for me and I will continue to purchase my gear and guitars from zZounds. The reason I gave Manufacturer Support 1 star is because I haven't had to use it.                
This is a really cool delay pedal! I really like how many features there are such as different delay times, an analog feature, and reverse feature. The tap tempo feature is really handy too for on-the-fly delay timing. The only slight downside is that it takes a while to dial in the perfect delay setting, depending on what you're looking for.                
Thing is perfect, when you diddle with the knobs you really feel like you're changing the sound, the delay, the feedback. Everything modifies the way you want it to be modified. This isn't a pedal you just turn on and off, you gotta mess with it.                 
Features? its built like a box, the effects from delay frequencies, looper built in, and reverse effects with an analog chorus? Screw the visual sound h20 pedal. Get this one, its cheaper and more efficient.                 
foot steps on pedal. Pedal works.                 
Its a boss product.                
i bought mine off ebay for 100 bucks perfect condition.                 
haven't needed support, which means well built product.                 
Looks great, love the color, bright LED, make people "want" you                
i use it whenever i can implement it in my band, and also the looper station entertains me for hours when i need to work on riffs and song writing.                 
Before getting this pedal I already had a dd20 in my setup but now that I have these two together, it is just amazing the things you can do with these both combined! Boss makes some real good pedals made to last and this one does not fall short from that category                
The boss DD-7 is a solid choice for a delay pedal. Does mostly everything you could want a delay to do. Reverse function is a really awesome addition to the DD-7. The ability to add a FS-5U footswitch to the unit is a must for the live musician who needs to tap tempo for delay on the fly. I would recommend this pedal for anyone looking to add a delay to their pedal chain. This is a must have.                 
I bought a DD7 and Flashback Mini at the same time. The DD7, I've known about for years. It sounds great...Boss has some great delays...ALMOST as good as TC. I love the fact that you can use the external tap pedal. Looping option is nice...I use the analog delay setting with the 2290 preset on the Flashback...they work very well together. Plus because it's Boss it's built like a tank                
I've been using Boss pedals for 15 years...  Crystal clear; Boss reliability.  Perfect!                
To be very honest, I regretted selling mine, I went on a venture thinking there are tons of other delay pedal  that are better and there are! but as far as reliability issues and consistency,The Boss DD-7 surpasses allot on this price range and function capability's.
I had two of these on my pedalboard set differently and it was great,no tone loss or I couldn't even tell. That's coming from a very overly picky person concerning tone!  If you got one of these,don't sell it unless its a matter of life or death situation. Now I gotta save up all over and deal with my intermittent, made in china, visual sound dual tap delay.
I have bunch of other boss pedals and not one of them ever crap out on me for as long as I've own Boss pedals over the last 25 yrs of playing live and studio! go figure I'll stick to the Boss from now on....                
I love this pedal. The sound quality is great and the modes really get your imagination going. 
For me it's a must have.                
I usually mess around with de Feedback and Delay Time knobs and I get some very intersting sounds from it!
One thing that is cool also is when I turn off the delay the sound doesn't break and I can continue to play without the delay.
The tap tempo is really easy to use.
But there is something that could be better. When on Hold for recording I can't use the Delay. That's a real shame...                
Very easy to use. 4 knobs.
Level
Feedback
Delay Time
Mode
Simple!                
It's a Boss!
I have dropped the pedal a few times and it's still workin'
A little bit of the paint went of and the Level knob is a little beated up.
It's rock solid!                
It's worth it!                
Never needed (and I guees I never will)                
Everything was great about the Boss DM-2W from build quality to sound, etc...very nice pedal with very cool options of expression pedal control and Wet/Dry Outputs.  I prefer Digital Delays to Analog.  Analog delays have warmer repeats and Iprefer more crisp, brighter repeats.  There is a "grainy" quality to the repeats of the DM--2W that some users may not like, it is there and is apparent.  I've read other users report the same findings.  If you like Analog Delays, give this a try, it is quality, just not for me.                
I use this with a zoom g2 and a bugera 1960 head.  i can get plenty of distortion with this unit.  I crank the distortion to near full back off the tone a little past half way and put level at half way.  I gig a lot and every musician I've talked to has told me they love the sound I get from that set up.  Sustain is unbelievable.                 
basic pedal easy to operate solid metal chassis                
set the three knobs where you want it and let it rip.  This unit will make a bad amp sound great.                
I've be around the block with pedals.  Multi-effects units leave the distortion empty and very digital sounding.  If you are looking for a great distortion don't let this pass you by.                
Here's the best part. I'm a part time musician.  When I do play I don't make thousands more like hundreds.  that being said 40 for a boss pedal that kick this much A$$ is outrageous.  They should lock someone up for that.                
I've never dealt with them before.                
most of the musicians can't believe the sound i'm getting from this thing.  I have people asking me about the pedal and the amp.                
This is great, i'd buy another one without a thought.  Looking at the overdrive pedal as the next pedal.  well done.                
I purchased 2 of these, one to mod,the other to leave stock. The whole process has been a gamechanger for me as a guitarist using pedals. While the stock pedal has a reputation for a "fizzy" distortion, it actually depends on the amp/guitar you are using. Some set-ups this pedal sounds iffy, others it's a WOW situation. The PERFECT pedal at the price it goes for, especially for modding. ORDER ONE FROM ZZOUNDS,they plain rock in the customer service dept., plus you can reach them on weekends!                
i love this distortion pedel is has great sounds for all my songs it realy makes my song sound better than it was.                
i think this product is made great.                
i think the price is great but i think u can make it more price                
the people i bought it from they were helpfull and friendly                
i think ill keep this distortion pedel for 1 year than get a better one when im better.                
there is nothing i would change on this beast of a pedal~!!!                
I use 2 chords and my Cort G-210 Guitar and a rocketech amp thats it no accesaries! , I went on a website and checked to see how to get certain sounds and its a great pedal Its sturdy and takes a beating the orange looks awesome and it has had no problems and i've played at talent show and it has never failed , when you come into a distortion part in a song it flows in  , Kurt Cobain had the exact same one and he played live with it , AmAzIng pedAl for aN AmAziNG PriCe! ! !                 
Never had a problem a little bit of chippin of the paint but who cares its amazing its small not a huge bulky piece of crap that breaks down and u never have to tighten it or get it fixed ! ! ! I've had mine for 3 years , I've never had a problem with it .                
Its an amazing deal i have other pedals worth 200-500 dollars and this  1 is the best workin and my favorite~~~!!! worth the every cent!                
Never had a problem i got mine FREE!!! of a family friend who plays in a band . !!!                
it looks awesome i play rock grunge and it is absoultly amazing , i could still make good music but it just sounds so much better chicks dig it ! ! ! and the person who made it is THe BEST !!! wouldnt change anything!                
It has exceded my expectations and i will buy boss over any other guitar equipment , customer 4 life! , i play my own stuff and mainly nirvana metallica ozzy ac/dc , and it sounds amazing i get ppls askin all the time were i got it and i always have offers after shows for it Is 1 of a kind !!!                
Great classic distortion while letting the natural tone of your guitar shine through. Good harmonic overtones on solo passages. I have 1 stock and 1 Keeley Self-Modded which I really love. Great tone for a great price. Many modding options available for this pedal.                 
Basic controls. True bypass would be nice. There is a mod for that also.                
Very easy to get a good sound.                
Good quality. Sturdy metal case can withstand lots of abuse. 5 year factory warranty if you don't take it a part.                
Affordable...                
N/A                
Practical go to pedal for distortion.                
I got it for the explicit purpose of modifying it.                 
When you have the distortion up to full you better have a noise suppressor, because at max level and distortion it sounds like crap. It is a distortion pedal so don't expect anything special out of it, It provides a nice distortion though.                 
3 Knobs... Tone, Level, and Distortion... Tone changes the tone of it lol... Like at 0 it sounds kinda bluesey and at 12 o clock it sounds good to me. Level would control the actual volume that the guitar has when the pedal is activated (sometimes i find that when i kick the distortion pedal in it gets really loud so this knob helps) And finally distortion wich controls the level of distortion. When this is at 0 it is still a bit distorted... So don't expect to just be able to use it for tone.                
Just turn the knobs until you find a nice sound it's pretty simple...                
Very nice, I don't think i've had any problems with it, easy to get batteries into if you use batteries (i use power supply with a splitter personally)                 
Worth the money.                
Very nice looking, personally I think boss pedals look the best next to Ibanez. It's a VERY nice looking orange. And I bought it with a pedal case that fits 3 boss pedals so I have it between a baby blue Chorus Ensemble and a White tuner pedal. It doesn't look half bad surprisingly...                 
A while, I might mod it in the future, but I think this is going to be with me for a LONG time... Unless I get a good multi-effects pedal, in which case I think I'll keep this for live shows etc as it's small and the box is easy as anything to carry around.                
it does what it is supposed to. its a great little distortion box. [10]                
great loud distortion. [10]                
just three simple knobs really easy of use [10]                
its a boss so ... you get the idea its built like a tank. [10]                
such a great pedal but i never thaught it would bo so cheap! [10]                
never had to deal with them [10]                
the bright orange isnt hard to miss plus i think its the best distortion box [10]                
i dont think this item will break but if it does ill surely by another [10]                
great for all types of sounds. fuzz metal, smooth overdrive. Its all here.                
it should come with adapter                
very easy to use 3 knobs tone, level, distortion, i dint take me long to find my favorting setting, easy to use                
its a tank . It will last 50 years. I dropp it all the time. It will never break                
best vaule out there i like it better than a 70 dollar pedal i have.                
no                
orange is cool                
I bought this for my son. He said this is exactly what he wanted. The tone is great and the pedal is very versatile. I noticed that it is well made and should last him for quite some time. Well worth it's price.                
the sound is great u can make it sound like korn and metallica and even slipknot if u want.                
the features r good so u can play alot of differnt styles of music on it                
the pedal is the best and u can beat it around alot and it will still work.cause i know i have been mad alot and i through it and a big stack of bricks and i threw it down to the cement drivway and i just had to plug it back in and it still worked fine                
yes it is                
never had a problem                
nothing to say bout' it                
u could do alot of stuff and it will work also alot of differnt singers u can play on it                
I play my bass through it and it doesn't cut off the lows at all.                
It just does what its name implies. No more no less. You want some guts? Step on it.                
duh. 3 knobs man. If you can't figure it out go play a clarinet or something.                
All boss pedals are hardcore durable. That's their biggest appeal over other manufacturers. This thing has been dropped, stomped on, and still works just fine.                
One of the best distorters in the world and only 40 bucks? who can say no?                
Boss guys are really down to earth. I had to talk to them about my micro-br before, not about this no-brainer, but they got right back ahold of me asap and answered my questions. No attitude.                
I just use the one my guitarist had when he switched to a big muff. I want one, but I dont need to buy one. As far as sex appeal... there's nothing sexy like a pimp bottom bass line that can get hard with one stomp. Thats what I like it for.                
I'm gonna use it until my guitarist wants it back then I'll just get my own. It works for bass signals, which is very rare for distortion pedals I have worked with, including dedicated bass overdrive by the same company that costs thrice the price.                
the sound quality is awesome!!!!!!!!.......... it does not sound good when it is high on dist & tone..                
some more extra knobs should do the trick......                
there are just 3 knobs so, it`s obvious that it is easy to use!!!                
boss is the best.                
worth ........                
the support from the boss is good                
instead of the orange i think black or any dark color would suit it...                
ds1 is handy!!!!                
don't listen to reviewers who say this pedal is crap. there the type who think it all sounds crap unless its ear splittingly loud and irritating. i've had this pedal over a year and it rocks. used properly it can drive your amp to the brink. i don't need another distortion                
simple controls yes but it isn't an aeroplane your flying is it. there's enough there to get alot of different tone's. the basic control's work with your guitar, not against it. just look at some of the pro's who have relied on this baby.                
walk in the park. ideal for any level of player                
you could switch it on and of with a tank and this beauty would still work fine. its solid and built to last. its a boss after all                
you won't find a pedal of this build and quality at a better price anywhere                
never needed them but i bet there customer support centre isn't busy                
yeah, thats why i've already got it                
i wouldn't trade this pedal for any other. what ever music you play this thing can do it. don't listen to the negative reviewer's, they obviously haven't set there guitars/amps right. this pedal is a rock legend. don't ignore it                
The sound of this product fits my needs perfectly. It has just the right amount of distortion. The sound isn't too muddy or unclear. The tone this pedal is really good. This pedal is good for playing alomst anything. I play a lot of Nirvana with it and it sounds exactly like them. The sound is great. It has a nice rock sound to it. Much heavier than overdrive pedals.                
It has a three knobs. Tone, level, and distortion. Turning up the distortion gives you a fuzz type of sound and turn it down gives you a warm overdrive sound. There is an adapter for it, but I don't have it.                 
It is built tough. I can tell it will last.                 
It was only $40.00! That is a steal for something this good.                
Haven't dealt with the company. 5 year warranty.                
The orange color looks cool.                
It is worth the money you pay for it. I'm glad that I got this pedal. I use all the time. If it was stolen or lost I would get another one. It's good for almost playing anything. I love this thing.                
I have 2 of these, one just bought recently just to replace the old one or maybe will try to MOD it has time, but overall, the DS-1 is a must have for starters. I love Boss pedals and I am beginning to collect them so the DS-1 should definitely be in my collection. The sound is pretty much easy to configure depending on what music you are. But this pedal in my opinion should be used for hard rock type of music. Not for blues of jazz. In my settings, as far as the tone knob is concern, I dont usually go beyond 11 o'clock and the gain will around 3 - 5 o'clock. But overall, it is still a great pedal.                
It sounds like a very straightforeward distortion. Not so much ugly hiss like some other pedals (especially on multi-effects) and I have used a LOT of different stompers. There are others with more specific tone characters to them like the Muff or the Screamer, but this is just what it says it is... very basic. Like distortion 101.                
THIS is why I had to get one of these. I play bass guitar and sing. I play the bass like a guitarist alternaming between 'lead' lines and a lot of power chords. I have a big problem with most dedicated drive effects for the bass as they tend to cut out the bottom end a lot and actually make it sound quieter when I kick it in, either that or the crunch isn't nearly enough for the full sound I need. The style I play is just my voice, my bass, and my drummer so I needed something that would really thicken it out to make up for the fact that it's just a 2 piece but I still wanted a full sound. I was playing at an open mic and I saw the bass player from another band that was rockin out on this thing and I asked him if I could try it out for my set and I couldn't believe how well it worked with a bass signal. NO cutting of the low, just a big ballsy evil heavy blast of noise and really made my higher register power chords fill out. I actually recommend this over dedicated bass guitar effects for drive. I got one a couple weeks later and run it between a cheap p-bass knockoff and a midsizey 90 watt behringer amp and my little minimalist 2 piece rock act suddenly had so much more oomf to it.                 
Its a distortion pedal. step on it. I turn the gain all the way up and the tone around halfway maybe a little brighter, and just fix the level so there is just a slight volume boost when it kicks in. Distortion isn't meant to make it louder, just to sound louder. Like I said, I don't experience any loss of low end when I put my bass into it.                
Boss stomper stuff doesn't break. Never in my experience anyways.                 
I was surprised when I found out it's so cheap.                
I never talked to them about this pedal, never had to, but the guy at the BOSS website was quick to answer a question I had about a recorder I used from them.                 
I used the borrowed one and went and got one of my own a week or two later.                
It's simple, durable, cheap, and does what it says it will do.                
This is a great solid, cheap, first-time pedal. I first heard it on a Peavey Blazer 158, and the sound was perfect! The dist. on it is great. It sounds the best on any peavey amp, but others, I would rate it a 6. Also, it is great for palm-muting.                
Not great, but provides a great range of Dist.                
"Very reliable and hard" is what you think of it after you have stepped on it thousands of times and nothing falls apart. It is also very easy to change backup batteries.                
It is totally worth its price because it is only 50 bucks with the power cable and its great sound                
I dont know about support of Boss because I didnt need any help with the pedal! All i know is that they make the very best of the best in Quality, and great sounding and looking pedals.                 
it does look kind of cool in a way doesnt it?                
I love it and there is nothing acceptionaly bad about it. I thingk it will last with me throughout my guitar career.                
I have a Blackstar HT20 & a Mesa Boogie and my main guitars are a PRS custom 24 and an Epiphone Les Paul plus top with gibson 490 & 498 pick ups.  Both my amps have great lead high gain channels.  This pedal kicks things up a notch and pushes them into 'the zone'. Thats whats the DS-1 is famous  for.  This pedal was made for driving tube amps hard and getting the most out of them.  Theres a reason why the DS-1 has stood the test of time.  Anyone who knocks pedal this doesnt know what they're talking about.                 
This pedal is one of the best pedals I've played up to date. when the tone level is at the bottom it sounds kinda bluesy. when it's at 12'0 clock it sounds realy high gained like grunge or metal when its at the end it sounds more like a overdrive. It's good for a lot of nirvana type music                
3 knobs, a input and out put and a battery compartment pretty simple. though it would of been nice if it had a AC adapter but if you use multiple pedals you should get a 1spot daisy chain sort of thing                
just turn the knobs to your liking pretty simple                
very well made and sturdy with it being made of metal you can really stomp on it                
39 bucks is way worth the money instead of buying one of those 100 digitechs                
Dont know I've only had it for 4 days                
it likes so awsome next to my crybaby and DOD chorus I like the color orange on it                
my greatest pedal I own sounds great and a really good price                
Really good, works well with cheap amps with a bad distortion.                 
no special features, just bare bone                
I've had it for 20yrs and it has never had a problem.                
Other pedals offer more options like Digitech                
Don't need it                
Very strong and durable, but get a Digitech to get the same sound pluss much more.                
Still sounds good, a little oudated.                
The Distortion Pedal. Played for 20 years, rock, funk, punk, and metal. Does it all.                
Three knobs; a Gazillion sounds. Metal box, like Boss does. Orange; easy to see on a dark stage. My first one lasted over 15 years.                
Intuitive is an understatement.                 
My original DS-1 was top notch. The 2nd seems no different. Time will tell, I'm sure.                
Had about 10 distortion/fuzz pedals. DS-1 always ends up in my signal chain. Awesome value.                
Stunning. Serious design genius.                 
Really good sounding lead distortion for any 70's-80's song. Goes from fuzzy to sharp with a twist of the knob. Great for solid rythms too. it's not bad for punk either.                
The features aren't numerous, but why would they be? Everything it has is all it needs                
It's solid as a rock                
For forty bucks, you get alot of pedal. Well worth the money because of its versatility                
Never had to call em                
It's a guitar pedal...                
It's a great Pedal                
the sound is for a more intense tone the white noise is quite noticable while not playing but while playing it makes the guitar scream just the way i like it, by itself its not the greatest sound but before my fuzz pedal i havent heard any other combination other than the ds-2 sound the way it does and thats a good thing! mixed with the right gain or other distotoin pedals it is a great effect for producing feedback                
lol ive beeb stomping on it for 2 years now and its still reacts like new something ive found very reliable from boss                
i love orange                
Great distortion. Makes my vocals send shivers down people's spines.                
It distorts and does that very well. <RANT>Though, as a keyboardist, I wish they had a similar model that was MIDI triggered, but I guess that's why we have effects units, right? Nice thought though!</RANT>                
Seems pretty durable, and the orange casing always gets attention.                 
Very cheap for an easy to use, quick setup distortion box. plug mic in and go. Demonic voices in a box! YAY!                
Haven't used it.                
Many notable industrial/EBM bands have used this unit. Ranging from :Wumpscut: to Skinny Puppy and Din_Fiv. So...there must be something to it. And we all know how good the distorted vocals of :Wumpscut: sound :D                
If you are doing industrial and want a good distortion effect for you vocals...this would be the box to get. Just wish it had MIDI :\                 
This pedal is the bomb and if u are getting it for around $40 get it no matter what.I payed $70 for mine and i don't regret it.I also own a line 6 POD 2.0 which i just got after DS-1 and i have two bands,1 in which i use a boss me-30(which is a dream pedal if u can afford $250).But for the price of the DS-1 and its simplicity there is no better pedal around.I wish there was a more crunchier effect thats it.Best used with a vox Wah.                
It only had 3 knobs for tone,level,and distorion unlike the DS-2 but still amazing.It came with a booklet that tells you some settings such as british punk,cruch,american rock,and ect. effects.I use a Les Paul and Strat with it and works great both ways.                
Very easy to use.Push and u got it.Turn black knob and change battery.Turn all 3 nobs all the way up and then turn tone down a bit or too where u like and u are set.Good Luck if u get it.                
The battery screw comes out alot while i am playing and causes me to have to stop song to screw in but if u screw it tight enough you will be fine and don't stomp like a monster with it.Won't break on ya don't worry.                
Price,Product,Perfect.The 3 p's.                
I dunno.No problems and i know alot of people with same pedal so i ask them.                
It called me over and said take me home with you even though i never really needed it even at the time i had 2 other chours distorion pedals.I went to store to get a new humbuckers and saw it and the ugre that i had for it when i started playing gutiar 2 years ago came back and i bought it.                
I think until i tottaly figure out my POD then this product is perfect.I will definetly not sell it and keep it aslong as i can.Maybe eventually give it to a young apprentice.Really its just a fun pedal to bring to jam seesionsand is really fun to mess around with.                
it is what it is, a good pedal                
its very nice has a nice sound to it but not the greatest so i give it a nine                 
not enough pick ups                
boss makes some of the best guitar accesorries                
some are cheaper and better                 
i wouldnt know i never had a problem with it                
yea distortion is a very sexy thing                
im sure another pedal will come along i like better                
It has a good tone of distortion, but I wish it was a bit less fuzz to it's tone.                
I wish it had some more...                
I like the way it was set up. Easy to understand.                
It was pretty cheap for a guitar pedal, so I didn't expect "Perfect" quality.                
It's pretty good, but there are plenty of better distortion pedals made by Boss out there.                
From light crunch to deep distortion just short of metal, this pedal has a wide range for anyone looking for a bit of a bluesy snap to a sharp solo distortion. the knobs are few, but very functional, to the point where a simple turn of the knob can change the character of your distortion. It's noiseless and works well with other pedals, and not just boss brand pedals. For 35-40 dollars, maybe half of that if you get it used, this pedal is the clearest distortion, rivaling pedals with triple the cost. Very, very worth it.                
Not a whole lot to offer, but if you're looking for your distortion pedal to do more than distort, you should stray away. This pedal serves one purpose and serves it to perfection: Distortion.                
Three knobs means that you have the ability to get a wide range of sounds without hours of messing with it. Also, the booklet offers a few great sounding settings, so be sure to check that out if you're having trouble with the tone.                
Boss pedals are notorious for lasting lifetimes. This is no exception.                
This is one of the best values in effects shopping. Great, versatile distortion under fifty dollars? It's the Behringer price at the Boss quality.                
Default ten because I've not needed it.                
It's construction orange. Not a bad look, and it stands out on your pedal board. Simple design, obviously functional rather than vain. As much as I love my equipment to look great, it's more about the tone, especially when it comes to pedals.                
Great distortion. I played with it in the store on the tower of boss equipment, and it made a lot of guitars sound very good. I would highly recommend it.                
Lets start w/ the goods. It has a wide variety of tones that fit almost every musical style. The EQ, while basic, is actually pretty good, and w/ the EQ and distortion, you can find almost any tone from punk to pop to blues.
But there are a few big negatives. First off, the distortion amount, while decent, isnt enough. Its barely usable for hard rock and metal (although I do use it for the rhythm guitar).                
There are three things here: a suprisingly effective EQ, a distortion knob, and a level knob. It gets the job done.                
Its a pedal. Duh.                
Well... its a Boss Pedal. I believe thats all I need to know.                 
OK. Its $100+ for a distortion pedal w/ weak distortion and a good EQ. I got a DanElectro FAB Metal (and three other pedals) for half that price. The DanElectro has just as good an EQ, better distortion, better looks, wider range of tones. Basically, better everything (except durability - the DanElectro is plastic). Is that a good comarison?                
Ill give it a 10 by default. I havent needed any help thus far.                
As I said earlier, its just a pedal. And to boot, it looks a lot like other pedals.                
OK. Knowing that Boss makes this pedal, it suceeds in the smaller area. But where it matters (sound), it falls way short, even with a shockingly good EQ. Bottom Line: Good for beginners. For experts/metalheads, get something else. A good pedal is the DanElectro FAB Metal.                
It sounds very electronic and doesn't have a lot of body.  Kind of brittle sounding.  When your roll the tone around all it really does is roll off the high end and muddy up your sound.  I run it at about 10 O'clock on TONE, 2 O'clock on DIST with my Strats.                
It has the usual.  No problems there.                
I've had trouble using a power adaptor.                
I guess you get what you pay for.                
I already have a RATT pedal from ProCo and it ROCKS.  I thought I would try this one out.  It's OK for a back up or for just some grungy chording.                
Tons of noise.  more noise than distortion.  When you do hear the distortion through the noise it sounds fakey and thin.                
no usefull features - the noise makes it unusable                
Very easy to use, just plug it in, turn up the level, listen to the white noise and un-plug it                
Its a boss - built like a tank - will never wear out.  Of couse it rearly gets used.                
does't cost much but does't do much                
never needed                
it does look good, but not very useful, everyone seems to have one , why I don't know                
Way over rated.  I don't know why people rave about it except maybe to justify their ownership.  The white noise overpowers the thin distortion produced by the DS-1.  Just overdriving my amp gives better and more sensitve distortion.  Look for something else or save your money for a nice tube amp with stepped gain that you can overdrive                
This is an on off switch for a very awkward sounding distortion. It is probably the cheapest pedal that boss makes and you get what you pay for. It sucks all the tone out of your guitar and the distortion it adds sounds more like killing a squirrel than rock and roll. I am goign to stick with my amp's overdrive feature.                
The distortion level knob gives you little to no actual control over it. the volume works but it is not a true sliding scale, it jumps so that there are about 3 real volume levels. and the tone  knob is also on/off.                
If you know kind of how any pedal works, this'll be a breeze. Everything is on/off.                
Lukily for boss they make their pedals strong enough to withstand those guitarist that actually stomp on their pedals. But once again, without it working correctly that doesn't mean much.                
To be fair, this is a cheap pedal.                
N/A                
Just because it's boss, which makes fantastic pedals, doesn't make the DS-1 a quality pedal. I suggest doing actual research before you buy.                
Look up youtube demos before you buy any pedal!                
Not for everyone, metal heads probably won't enjoy it. However, I personally love the sound it creates, very classic rock. On my les paul it sounds great especially on the treble pickup. Not as great on my telecaster, I think it reacts much better to humbuckers than single coil. It doesnt seem to offer as much of a boost on single coils, and it buzzes more, but the pickups on tele's have always been pretty loud. 
Does have some buzz but only on extreme settings, don't push both knobs past 3 o'clock at the same time, and it shouldnt be noticeable. I don't think you'll find a distortion pedal that can remain silent on maximum settings.                
Why don't these stupid things ever come with an AC plug? I'm not going to run on batteries forever. On the good side, solid metal not plastic like many pedals, obviously isn't falling apart like ever.                
Straight forward controls. Gotta love that. Doesn't take a lot of playing with the dials to find a great sound, and they respond even to incrimental adjustments.                
Perfect. Obviously built solid, extremely durable. No wonder they offer a 5 year warranty, no one ever needs it. I'm sure a fat man could jump up and down on it for five years without it breaking.                
I think Boss is just a little overpriced most of the time. Danelectro's are just as nice and way cheaper, although I suppose they are also made of plastic. This pedal, though, is very cheap relative to the Boss norm.                
I just haven't dealt with the company, haven't needed to.                
I don't think it's very desireable, that's why it's so cheap off the list price. Frankly it's fugly. However, I don't care as long as it works well.                
A solid pedal. Not the widest variety of sound but great at what it does. I think I'll nick name it captain crunch.                
Great distortion pedal.                
Easily adjustable.                
The box is well made. Can you break this thing?                
GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY!                
Boss is #1 in my book!                
Very attractive distortion pedal. Love the orange color.                
I will use this pedal from now on. I own an Ibanez fuzzy pedal that doesn't even compare.                
The sound quality is awesome, just like almost everything else about it. It really captures yoour nuances and holds them out there. I love NIRVANA, and considering that even Kurt Cobain used this and the DS2, it is the perfect pedal for grunge, alternative, and punk rock. I is perfect for my style of music and, I'm sure, for many others as well.                
This product is to good for "extra accessories." It's sound, sturdiness, easy storagebility, and overall simplicity makes up for anything you were hoping to get along with the stompbox.                
Amazingly sturdy. It's sturdiness is probably the best part.                
It was a steeeeeeeeeealllllll!!! Don't raise the price though, more people will buy it just the way it is! Don't change a thing! Leave this pedal exactly like it is, its PERFECT!                
It has a 5 year warranty, but I dont think I'll need it at all! Thanks though.                
I just love the orange color, it goes great with it's sound! It's also small and easy to store.                
This is the perfect distortion pedal! It's younger sister, the DS2, is a very close second!                
it kills the battery really quick. should come with the power adapter                
I'm trying to replace a Boss ME-20 multi-effects pedal, so I've been experimenting with overdrive & distortion pedals.  Boss has a great reputation, but I found the DS-1 to be thin sounding. Playing an American Tele through a Fender Blues Jr. I couldn't get a meaty sound out of this pedal & returned it after a few days of trying.                
It doesn't have have heavy ditortion at all only good for if you need a little distortion to you song                
Can't adjust sound the sound much at all 
hardly any features at all beside 3 nobs                
buit tough                 
Buy a digtech pedal                 
didn't need any                
Hardly even use it since i got my behringer amp                
Tja... das ist nicht so gut - that means "its not so good", for those who dont know German. Its not a great distortion pedal at all. It has a decent amount of distortion, but not enough for metalheads like me, and it has too much distortion for overdrivers. 
The tone knob has quite a bit of range, but still. When you turn the tone knob up a lot, its too tinny and thin; turn it down a lot, and it has no bite at all. You have to keep it at 12 or 1 o'clock for best results.                 
Theres three knobs, a Gain Knob, a Tone Knob, and a Level Knob... a bit run-of the-mill here. Especially considering that the three knobs are the EXACT same knobs used in other pedals.                
Well, with the lack of features, it easy to use, right? RIGHT? Just turn the knobs until you get a sound you like (might not happen with this pedal, though.)                
Spell it: B-O-S-S. Be, oh,es, es. Got it?                
Well, its only $40. Thats good. If youre on a budget, you could get this pedal OR you could get the DigiTech Hot Head (with better, heavier, less tinny distortion AND an actual EQ - fine, it only has  Low and High knobs, but it counts) for the same price. Take your pick.                
I have no clue, really, so Ill give it a five.                
Uh... no. Orange doesnt work too well here. Sorry.                
Parents, if your son started guitar lessons yesterday, this isnt a bad pedal. Players, if you have little money to spare, this isnt a bad pedal. But two things: first off, were looking of "good", not "not bad", so get the DigiTech Hot Head instead. Two, experts (and intermediate players) who have money to spare, STAY AWAY. Spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere, because this wont cut it.                
This pedal has really basic but cool distortion sounds. I really love it. I try to put my distortion to others though, and with this its kinda hard cuz its pretty basic, but it still has great distortion.                
theres really not much to talk about: tone, level, and uhh. i forget the other. ha. but yea, REALLY EASY TO FIGURE OUT.                 
Reallyyy easy to use and figure out.                 
pretty good i guess. its like metal, pretty sturdy. I've had it for like two years, and its still perfect.                
its great. same prices as everywhere. its affordable and sturdy. nothing tooo special though.                
I LOVE ZZOUNDS. i didnt use them for this, but ive been a long customer of theres, and id much rather give my business to them rather than the long-ruling empire of guitar center.                 
its orange.                 
its your basic distortion pedal. the original really. lots of guys have used this, and i can see why.                 
This pedal has a very loud sound                
Just three simple knobs                
Very easy to use, just click it and turn a knob                
This product is worth it's price especially if your a beginner.                
Bright orange, not hard to miss                
I'll pretty much keep this pedal for a while                
Not the best I've played with. But if this is your first pedal then I reckon you buy it.                
Limited, but decent enough for you to have some fun.                
Very easy to use.                
Boss is a great maker of effects pedals but this maybe isn't their best.                
Excellent price.                
Very Good                
I wouldn't buy it myself but it is good for beginners.                
This product is good for people who want to have fun. I wouldn't use it in a gig though.                
This is one pedal every guitarist needs in their arsenal. I prefer the sound to this over any product, other then the fulltone mosfet but thats almost 170 pounds more exspensive!                
go from blues t metal just by changing the pickup selector!!                
3 knobs. all that needs to be said                
had it over 4 years now and its never let me down                
Like i said i would pay over 200 pounds for this bad boy ad i picked it up for 30!                
never had to use it!                
its orange...                
there is a definate reason why steve vai and joe satriani use this. its amazing.                
doesn't change the actual dynamic of your sounds.                
Comes with level and tone and distortion, what more do  you need?                
three knobs, very simple layout.                
Easily made for abuse, or oops, won't hurt it. Never fails, and always works. Won't need a backup, made like a tank.                
compared to other units, a great price.                
Never had a problem with it.                
The sound isnt horrible but its extremely basic. This pedal is extremely overrated. The MArshall Guvnor 2 is a much better pedal-it has character, more gain, a better low gain tone, and a really nice eq. This pedal is not versatile at all.                
Basic features. Tone (useless), Distortion (not versatile), and LEvel.                
Its easy to get tones from it but the tones arent very good.                
Great quality, although again, MArshall guvnor is probably more durable.                
It is a pretty cheap pedal, but really, save up for the Guvnor-20 dollars extra.                
N/A                
I dont need this pedal-its obselete.                
It's an ok pedal for the price but its very bland.                
This was the first pedal i ever got and i am not going to ever throw it out. you can get any sound you want from the beatles to metallica                
doesn't have any fancy knobs or anything, just distortion. its built like a tank too.                
only 3 knobs. how hard is that?                
built like a tank. if you throw it out the window it won't break                
for 30 bucks you cant get a better distortion bedal                
never needed it                
i only got it because i had no idea about what amps and pedals were good (i just started playing). now that im good at guitar i realize how great it is                
this pedal, along with a good lead channel from an amp, can get any sound you want. this is the first pedal i ever got and its not going to leave my pedalboard. for 30 bucks you should get it anyway, whithout trying it out.                
Damn! Sounds better than a chainsaw!                
Not a lot to play around with.                
Thumbs up for the manual. However, the controls are so
simple you don't need a manual.                
It's a beauty inside and out.                
I've tried a few  pedals in it's price range and
nothing comes even close.                
No problems so far but I asked about it in the shop
and they said it's covered.                
When I saw it I was like a girl looking at a pair
of designer shoes - I had to have it.                
It's so good that if I ever go looking for a new
pedal it will be BOSS again.                
The tone is really good but it gives off TONS of white noise.                
Very simple                
all you do is step on it, just like any other                
all metal, it takes a beating                
Its a good pedal for the money.                
none needed                
I just needed a better ditortion pedal then the digitech grunge pedal, cause that one sucks.                
Its good but, wayyyy to much white noise, the humming is way to loud, bad for recording.                
THE GREATEST PEDAL EVER. Itr's best when you use it on a Fender Strat or Fender Mustang and maybe also a Fender Jaguar. It's just a Fender Pedal And i Love it                
it's great because it isn't complicated like the other pedals with more then 1 thousand of bbuttons on it                
easy...                
yup                
yes it really is but also need an wah wah pedal                
don't really know                
it's sexy                
uim i think the color may be changed                
I love the sound this gives although it took me awhile to find the right sound but after you play with it; it comes easy!                
All you need is in the box.minus a cord but yeah no pedal comes with those                
the ds-1 is extremely well made                
The best for the money                
Havent had a problem they look and feel pretty sturdy                
This litttle orange pedal will look good in front of any amp!                
I love this pedal                
i play mostly hardcore punk and metal and its great i also use and sd1 overdrive petal for palm muting but its a sweet ass pedal                
since it has 3 knobs it is easy to get the sound u love and it has a very wide varity of sounds                
it has good quality, very sturdy and durable                
come its only $40 for an amazing pedal no question                
no problems                
great distortion pedal to have, there are better ones out there but none that come even close in the price range                
I use it with my LTD Ec-50 and it sounds great. Rapes the overdrive on my marshall MG15CD. I only play metal(just about every kind)and it does a pretty good.It isn't the best sound out there, but for such a low price it's a steal.                 
I bought it for distortion, and that's exactly what I get.                
No clue, just bought it.                
Like I said before, it's a steal.                
Haven't needed it yet.                
Cool, but it need more effects                
yes, owners menu                
its cool                
y pay some expensive$                
more or less                
The DS1 captures every nuance and is really precise. If you explore its settings and tweak them around, the sound possiblities are almost endless!                
The DS1 is extremely well made. It's very, VERY sturdy and sounds good, too. I've been using it almost every night since February and the original batteries haven't run out yet! Although it has a 5 year warranty, I don't think I'll need it. It's just so sturdy; and yet, it's also light and doesn't take up hardly any room.This pedal is most definetly compatible with my style of music. It is an investment I'm truly proud of and this won't be the last BOSS or ROLAND product I purchase.                
It may be "bottom-of-the-line," but it's definetly worth more than it's price (please don't raise it though!).                
Well...it's orange and looks cool...It's just simple...and...easy to use and...just well made. It's simplicity and just overall greatness is what makes it awesome.                
I don't know what I'd do with out it...seriously!                
I've compared the DS-1 to just about every pedal since the early '80s and the DS-1 produces less noise and more bite for the money. I dont need all the EQ parameters of other distortion pedals that have hit the market over the years since I primarly use it with a Roland MC-202 MicroComposer for some badass acid lines. The tone knob is all I need, since any further EQ adjustments can be made from my mixer. As for playing guitar, I would naturally add a Boss EQ pedal at the beginning of the effects chain to gain all the characteristics most of these inexperienced kids seem to whine about. :p                
No accessories were included. All the features I need are there. I dont need any more or less, considering the price of the unit. If this pedal wasnt so good, it wouldnt be around after 27 years. It truly stands the test of time, being the most popular distortion pedal of all time.                
This unit (as well as all Boss pedals) is built like a tank! I've owned many other bands and Boss just cant be beat for their reliable quality construction that will last a lifetime when taken care of properly.                
Worth every last penny! Definitely more bang for the buck!                
I never had any problems with the DS-1 or any other Boss pedal for that matter, but I've ordered parts for other used Roland gear and had no problem with those orders.                
I definitely dig the orange color and the old style knobs that have remained the same since it first hit the market. The practicality is a must and I still get an erection just looking at it. ;)                
The DS-1 will always keep me satisfied. I wouldnt replace it, but I'd definitely supplement it with more effects units. This unit entirely meets my musical goals. If it were lost or stolen (which I highly doubt) I'd replace it with the same exact unit. What I like most about it is the fact that it gives me plenty of distortion with minimal noise. Theres conflicting stories that the early Japanese made units are better than the current units made in Taiwan, so I'll have to pick up a vintage DS-1 and compare for myself.                
its cool but its not for hard rockers it sounds tough                
Grungey sound   like nirvanas  "bleach" and "Nevermind"                
Best deal ever    cheap for a great product                
Kurt Cobain used this during the bleach and nevermind eras                
The Best  Pedal Money can buy, Boss hit the G spot with this Distortion pedal. What can I say about the DS-1X . (HOT BUTTER).  Boss has always made good pedals for years.  Can and will Boss ever top this pedal? Only time can tell. 
Thanks Boss for an amazing  pedal. and ZZounds for always being there for me.                
I got the wall adpator to keep from burning through batteries. Anyway, this makes a great complement to the Blackstar combo amp! I need nothing else for practice and jamming to blues, jazz, rock and some metal                
Ok...Ive played with the DS-1 and wanted to like it , I've owned it a few times, trying to dial in the sound and never could get a good sound out of it, NOT understanding how Satraini and Vai and Lynch have one in their Pedal boards, because i just don't hear any resemblance to a DS-1 in their Tone. I guess if i wanted a grungy tone or a Sex Pistols tone it would be great but I play Glam 80's Rock and there was no way that pedal was going to give me that tone. Also I have never found a distortion that you could go through a clean channel on a tube amp head and it sounds good, always lacking a bottom end and sounds terrible and trebly. I use a Blackstar HT Metal 100 Watt Head into a 4X12 cab for live shows and I cannot get a great distortion out of it and it's been depressing. I even recently tried the Boss GT-100 processor in hopes of a better tone, cool stuff but just don't have months to play with it and dial sounds in. The other day I even tired out a Boss MT Metal Zone pedal....cool but extremely buzzy. So in my depressing state, as a last ditch effort I watched an hour or so reviews on the new Boss DS-1X, on Youtube, it's getting great reviews and to be honest i was skeptical , but what did i have to lose? and to be honest, most of the reviews I was still skeptical.  $149.00 isn't pocket change for most of us But I ordered it two days ago and it showed up on my doorstep last night (litterally got it within 24 hrs!!) I plugged it into the smaller Roland practice amp I use here at the house with all the settling at 12 o clock...Not bad, not great, messed with the two EQ seting knobs and in the end was kind of depressed thinking it didn't sound that much different from the regular DS-1 ...in fact i was going to return it this morning. I got up this morning and decided to go over to our practice studio and plug through my main live rig before returning it.  I'M GLAD I DID!!!! with the settings ALL at 12 o clock this thing sounded like a complete monster!!! Thick tone, Bottom end, great distortion and something i really NEED ...great long sustain!!! it is everything the Metal zone is but without the buzzing tone and when you roll off your volume it cleans up well. Even with the distortion when you are at full volume, you can hear each note clearly, something i couldn't get with the Blackstar amp distortion or with any processor or distortion i have tried. I tweaked the lows up to both about 1-2 o clock, level at 12 o clock and distortion at 12 o clock and it sounded even better and full. Turning the distirtion to 3 o clock gave me that Metallica distortion and tone which 12 o clock still gives me plenty to play Sabbath!!! the versatility of this pedal is amazing. We are primarily Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Kiss, Crue, Poison, Great White covers as well as countless others and THIS is the pedal and tone i have been searching for for the past 20 years...YES it is THAT good!!!, we just started doing some Iron Maiden as well and this is gonna give me THAT tone too. I think BOSS has outdone themselves with this one...I might even buy another one to put away in case this one ever breaks LOL...I really love this thing...Buy one...a couple shows and it will pay for itself!!! Easily one of the best things i have bought in a very long time!!!                
I'm 58 and have boxes of pedals.  This is the best thing I've ever heard.  I give guitar lessons at a music store and all the guitarist / salesmen are getting one. 
You can not dail a bad sound everything sounds great. A little distortion sounds great.  A lot of distortion sounds great.   Any High and Low setting sounds great.  Better than amp distortion.  GET ONE!  VERY inspiring and RESPONSIVE.  Cleans up very nicely with guitar volume and soft picking.                
So...I am blown away at how versatile this thing is! Far more than I expected. First, it does what it is supposed to do, turns effects on and off in any order as you would expect. Second, you can change the order of your effects without moving pedals, run them in parallel when the input of one pedal would adversely affect the next pedal in your chain (priceless IMO), and switching is fast and quiet (no popping or delay). Third, You can use the MIDI function to control amp channel switching (I play through a Marshall JVM 410H). Every function of my rig is literally one step away. The best of a rack system without the rack and the simplicity of a pedal board. These cats thought of pretty much everything. You can even use the mute button as a bank up or down button so you don't have to run through the banks 1-5 before you can get back to the bank you want. Takes some reading to get going, but once you figure out the first patch the rest is pretty simple. Much more to this thing than meets the eye. I was pleasantly surprised!                
Possibility's are endless, is an understatement concerning this product  Everything about this product is brilliant well thought out for the giggin guy! whether you play at different clubs every weekend doin top 40 stuff,or out on tour, its everything I would need and more. 
The only down side to this product is the manual,I've been a Boss/Rolland user for 3 decades and they build great products for giggin guys but the manual is never the easiest.  Knowing how Boss/Roland manuals are,as usual,I took a good part of a sunday afternoon to learn it. Once you learn the ES-8 through all the manual, its a piece-O-cake. 
I highly advice learning it through the manual and knowing how to set it up before using the editor,this makes you a proficient pro musician in the middle of a set songs live on stage,when changes are needed...  highly recommend!                
I can't tell you how long I've been using BOSS and Roland products, but somehow I haven't thought of anything to say. Even though I've enjoyed their products throughout the years performing and recording with them. 
Well first it's affordable. After scouring the internet looking for a innovative, powerful switching system where the price was right, I finally came across the BOSS ES 8. Even though it arrived a little late in the pro switching system game, their incredible features and a doable price was just what the doctor ordered.      
Second, it's built like a tank and can handle the road for extensive touring. BOSS never makes flimsy products IMHO.
An important feature I admire the most is that no matter where you place pedals on your pedal board, the ES-8 will allow you to place each pedal in any order. Because of that and it's powerful MIDI features, I'm able to assign any of my fourteen pedals in any order in any patch and bank. Yes, fourteen. You don't have to settle for just eight pedals on your board because you see eight programable switches. 
As with all of there products, even though the programming is easy, the possibilities is limitless. After I've spent some time with it to see how best it could serve my needs in the studio and during live performances, I came to the conclusion that I've made the right choice purchasing this product. It's a beautiful tool that will be in my arsenal for some years to come.
With a full pedalboard, there is a lot of tap dancing and program switching involved in between songs or sections of songs. This thing has made everything so smooth. I program in tempos, pedal orders, etc and just step on one switch per sound and the es-8 handles everything. Love it, my tone is less noisy, the board is cleaner, and I switch like a pro. Love it!                
I needed a latching footswitch to control the effects on my Mackie mixer. This one seemed to fill the bill. The only problem I had was that the LED did not come on when I first tried the switch, before connecting it to the unit. The instructions did not actually cover this at all. So, on a hunch, I connected the switch to the mixer and turned it on. The LED functioned perfectly. The polarity switch gave me the option of either synchronizing the LED on the mixer and the LED on the switch or having the LED on the switch go on when the LED on the mixer was off, and vice-versa. Definitely worth the money.                
Had this on backorder awaiting Boss production and release. Received this and Propellorhead Reason 8 December 24th. WOW! What a Christmas this was for this old man! Pedal is great shape and the true beauty of this is no need for battery and no need for another Boss power supply. The supplied power splitter worked great with the PSA-120 power supply I use with my Boss ME-70 effects board and powers both devices. I currently use pedal A for reverb on/off and pedal B for bank switching with a TRS cable, but will experiment with other A/B cable options. Going battery free puts this well above previous Boss foot switches at a comparable price. I'm loving it and you will as well!                
great little pedal fits really good on the pedal board and works perfect for my needs.never needed manufacture support. and there's no sound and that's a good thing.                
Expression pedals and volume pedals are tricky, especially if you own a Nord Electro 3.  If you have one, it behooves you to buy a pedal that can serve as both an expression and an in/out volume pedal.  I prefer an extra large throw and something that is solid and large.  This Boss pedal is all of the above---the best one out there.  If you don't want a bulky pedal, don't buy this one.  It's built like a tanks and is almost as big.  I hate the small flimsy pedals, like the Roland EV5, or the ones that don't work properly, like the Alesis.  If your serious about performance and don't mind a big foorprint, just buy this...you won't be dissapointed.                
It's both an expression pedal and/or an in/out volume pedal.  It's nice to be covered both ways...actually it's essential.  Also the minimum volume is an prerequisite feature, which it's got.                 
If you can't figure it out, perhaps you're in the wrong field.                
It's metal contruction, built like a tanks.  I beat the crap out of mine for 3-4 years, didn't even keep it ithe box..just threw it around and into my gig bag....actually killed it.  Then I tried a bunch of cheaper pedals----don't do that.  They're mostly garbage.  I finally just bought it again and now I take care of it.  So if you beat the crap out of it, it will still give you 3-4 years.  If not, it might last forever.                
Yes, its not cheap.  But it's worth it.  One of those deals.  If you're a gigging musician, it's a good value.  Quality counts for a lot.                
not applicable                
Looks pretty good, although Boss in general is not something that would typically produce that much wood.  I generally prefer somthing with a more vintage look.  But I would submit that this category is fairly moronic.  Buy it because it does the job.                
It's the best one out there.                
Takes nothing away from the sound of my guitar. It's perfect for swells and changing volume when you can't stop picking.                
The adjustable volume in the closed position is very cool, you can make quick volume changes. The adjustable tension is a great feature, most volume pedals don't have enough resistance for me. I tighten this up so there is no accidental volume changes.                 
Does everything it's supposed to do and more.                
It's built like a bank vault. No worries about this pedal breaking.                
Worth every penny I spent on it.                
Haven't had to deal with them.                
The features I mentioned before are only available on this pedal.                
This will be the last volume pedal I will ever buy.                
Expression pedals are tricky---especially with the Nords and the Hammond clones. This is one of the few pedals that works with the Electro 3 and Hammond SK series.It's got a long throw and you won't kick it around because it's got some good aluminum beef. Never mind the cost---it's 10 times the pedal as the ev5.                
I was really surprised at the quality of this pedal. I originally bought it to be an expression pedal for my timeline pedal, but I have been using it mostly as a volume pedal so far. I am strongly considering getting another to be my expression pedal down the road. I would get this pedal again for sure. Built strong, glides up and down smooth and the tuner out on the left side is a god send. you can mute your guitar live and tune it up then slam it down and start playing again. awesome pedal great value!                
This is a great volume pedal but it does seem to lose a little treble when turning down. Still love it....                
This is where this pedal gets awesome. Using it aligned as a mooger fooger expression pedal is much fun and then back to its original duty as a volume pedal.. Adjusting the amount of volume you want to control is awesome and much needed as well as the tuner output.                
Easy as can be                
Its Boss! I have a bunch of boss stuff and its all incredible reliable. This is probably tougher than the pedals but I am not worried about it longevity at all. Probably outlive me.                
You get what you pay for. Its not the cheapest pedal in the world but its what you expect to pay for quality equipment.                 
N/A                
It is very sexy as far as volume pedals go... I really love it                
I do not expect to buy a volume pedal ever again. If a) it doesn't break or b) doesn't get lost or stolen. 
There is no reason for me to upgrade as this suits my style completely: This is not JUNK. It has a great action and smooth feel.                 
Noisy and scratchy. I never used its expression mode, but it was nice to know that it was there. My musical styles had nothing to do with my choice or uses of the pedal.The pedal was worthless for recording, disconcerting in rehearsal, annoying when demoing sounds in songwriting, and a big hassle on stage, the main reason that I junked it! If you can keep it quiet, good luck- it may get you through real world use for a while without major trouble- then again... replace the pot. with optics, duh!                
most useful features: stereo ins and outs; expession mode;minimum volume sensitivity adjustment.tuner jack; battery operation and power supply option. Least useful was the potentiometer, ruining its usefulness and wasting time, money, vbe- it's a big hassle!                
At first, it sounds okay- a few days later, expect the pot. to go out and leave you with a noisy clunker! iT'S EASY TO USE WHEN WORKING PROPERLY. THE ONLY BIT OF LEARNING INVOLVES THE EXPRESSION PEDAL, NO BIG DEAL. It's playable for keyboards and drum machines (my main uses), and I found it alright for guitar and bass.                
Made well enough except for the potentiometer- Which is like saying that a Volvo is well made except for having a sucky engine and transmission! Rreliable? NOT!!! It wouln't last nearly long enough, and it's cosmetically benign, if boring-undistinguished.                
No way!!!                
Yes. Customer service was 119% unresponsive, and impossible to reach!No friendliness or unfriendliness, just lacking effort and problem solving. I gave up, patience being finite...                
IF the pot. problem were fixed, I'd consider this pedal in its price range; otherwise, I'd pass it up!                
I used to own one of these noisy, scratchy-potentiometer duds. I admit to never having used the tuner jack, so I have no complaints there. The Ernie Ball pedals are quiet and study, a better choice. If you need to save money, buy a behringer cheapie or two and treat them gently! Morleys are fine, but also too fragile to leave home! I currently use a Visual Volume pedal that kicks butt! If I were to recommend only one volume pedal, I'd say to go with Visual Volume. They're worth the dough!                
Fantastic product! Easy to use...can't say enough good about it. One of the guys in the band let me use a Morley pedal, but I had some noise problems with it. Once the Boss pedal was connected, no more noise issues & everything worked great.                
No accessories...                
E-Z setup!                
Well-made...no problems.                
Haven't had any issues...service from zZounds is great, too. (I called zZounds prior to placing order on-line.)                
Definitely a practical addition to my keyboard setup.                
I'd definitely buy another one, whenever this one wears out. Boss was recommended to me as a producer of great products, & he was right. I play a Roland keyboard & had used a Bespeco volume pedal for over 10 years. I definitely prefer the Boss pedal & will stay with that from now on. I like the fact that the Boss pedal doesn't require a battery, as the Morley pedal did.                
I just received this Boss Volume Pedal and am using it with my Korg Krome and King Korg Synths. Decent pedal for the price. Nice feature to have two inputs and outputs so I can control volume of both of my keyboards through one pedal. Cuts down on needing a second volume pedal. Built good and so for no issues. I give it a solid A on value and quality.                 
Very happy and satisfied with the prompt delivery and the quality of the volume peddal excellant prices.   I will most assuredly order other merchandise from this company when needed. 
THANK YOU zZOUNDS
I purchased a keyboard from zZOUNDS and it had accessories and I ordered the foot peddal to use with it                 
Every thing with this product was convenient to use and understand.   The manuals were very helpful and informative.                
The product more than surpassed my expectations, and it seems more than adequate to use on the road or in your home.   It is an excellant looking pro instrument.                
zZounds had the best prices around.  I checked web site after web site they were the best.                
?                
This is it for me.  If anything happens to this keyboard I'll replace it with the same brand of keyboard.                
I have a Dunlop JH fuzz and this FZ-5 with its three non-Dunlop emulations. All four are different. The Maestro setting was so off the wall that I had ZZsounds replace the pedal. What I ended up with is a Maestro setting that at least doesn't totally cut out but who can tell the difference. If you want fuzz know what fuzz you want, they are all different.                
For whatever reason, though I have been playing guitar for many years I've never bothered to put anything into the  FX loop other than a chorus or delay pedal. Recently I've decided to lose the multi fx pedal I use and go straight into the amp. Well I wasnt able to get close to the tone I wanted so a friend suggested I try a GE-7 through the FX loop of my amp which is a Valveking 112 into a Sheffield 4x12. Bought one here at ZZ and proceeded to try it out in the FX loop.. WOW!! That's about all I can say. I don't even need the 4x12 any more which makes gigging so much easier. This pedal brought a low end(though modified) amp like a VK112 into Mesa territory and I kid you not. Slight bumps and slight cutting of certain frequencies on this pedal  and  it turns your amp into a monster. I have been playing for over 25 years and have owned many expensive and big name amps but this pedal into a cheap amp competes with and actually tops some of them easily!! I can say in all honesty that the only reason I'd ever buy another amp is as a backup and to see what this pedal can do to another amp.                 
tip to make the sound better? just study the ranges - frequencies are sensitive - adjust to suit your need, your taste                
as ever - boss pedals are STURDY, strong to withstand all road conditions, weather even..                
good enuf for a great gear                
haven't gotten in touch w/ the company which made the boss ge7                
the color bothers me, light yellow, blue might be better, but its purely my opinion - my choice of color.
i lusted for this product when i found what it can do, its a great gear to pomp my performances
color versus the use and its contribution to me - i say id buy it even if its baby pink... :-)                
nope, i dont have a need as of now for other products- the ge7 equalizer works well w/ my boss bass chorus and flanger, and the best it can stand alone w/ my yamaha APX3.                 
Really helps to shape your tone, or is awesome as a solo boost in your effects loop.                
It has more then enough bands and the level slider is a plus.                
As long as you know what EQ does there no no learning curve for this pedal.                
Like all Boss pedals. Built to last a long time.                
Well for a simple EQ I'd rather pay a bit less.                
never had to deal with Boss directly. I guess that is good, never had a problem with any of their products.                
I like the look of all the Boss pedals.                
I use mine as a boost for my guitar solos. If it were lost or stole I would replace it immediately with the same item.                
Great product. The only thing wrong is you need ear plugs after a while. The pitch is really high and it slices through your ear. I use it through the ex loop in the back and not in front of the amp. And I would like to hear it with a bbe maximizer, something that bring out highs and lows naturally. I think both of them together would sound cool.                
It could of come with an adapter.                
I used it a lot when I first got then had it in a closet for a long while.  Just recently I started using it again and it still works fine after being just thrown in a dust filled closet.                
There is a bbe maximizer for the same price and I would rather use that.                
To me it still hold up even with all these new eq's and other big bottom and high enhancments.                 
One word: TONE.  This thing is awesome, it can be used for any type of music.  If you have a distortion pedal, and you're just not getting enough tone, buy this.  It can make any sound sound sooo much better.                
Good, i guess, i dont really care, i just care about the sound                
You're gonna have to play around with it alot until you have the sound you want.                
it wont break, its built like a tank                
its a bit pricy, but worth every penny                
i dont know, never dealt with them                
Equalizers are just awesome.  You can get great tone out of it, no matter what kind of music you play.  I recommend this product to anyone who needs that extra 'oomph' to your sound.  I don't know how long this will last, but when it does die out (if it does), I'll get another equalizer, but probably that twin pedal equalizer that Boss makes.                
It helps other effects to sound more effective in certain ways of playing.                
This pedal really works for solos and boosting your sound during the chorus part of the song you played. If you play rythmic leads in the verse it also help to enhance your guitar sound more clearer and brighter by simply adjusting the Level slightly way up. It also makes my modulation effects sound great in some certain ways in my own taste of listening.                
I have eight Boss Pedals so far, I like them all not only for the sound but also in quality they can take a proper abusive use in stage or in the garage. They don't broke easily like most other pedals. They last long-including the sound never changed stay theysame the way it is.                  
I give a 9 on value because for me a $100.00 retail price is a bit quite expensive to its usefullness. If this pedal supply also power to other boss pedals like the NS-2 its more better but its not. A $79.00 or $89.00 for this one will be a great value overall.                  
Im curious before how this pedal really shape the sound in whole my set-up but once I own it really help in certain ways in making your sound more effective in stage or during a practice or even in your room.                
This quite expensive for a 7-band EQ but its Boss dont worry it will last for a long long time..                 
I use this pedal to increase the distorion pedal i also have. It makes a HUGE difference in sound when it is on. My guitar comes through cleaner, louder and more powerfully.                
I've gone through the VG8 to the GR30 and the Boss GP10 finally ties it all together. VG sounds, plus regular preamp, any blend thereof plus great effects all easily configured with a USB editor. All sounds coming out of my regular guitar amp mono. I use it on all my electric gigs now, 1-2-3 a week. Love it!                
I have owned a VG-8 and a GR-55 and this thing rocks with better tracking, better sounds and an overall smaller package.                 
Unfortunately, while it is a good idea it fell short of my needs and I will be returning it today.
Some the biggest "issues" for me are that, for the price, there are too many limitations when selecting effects for a given patch -if you want a compressor, you can't have something else, etc...  In this day and age, processing power is cheap and it seems that BOSS is deliberately "dumbing" down products for marketing reasons.  IN addition, the AMP and EFX affects both the guitar input and the modeller so, you can't have two separate processing.  Huge shortcoming for me.
The tracking varies widely between WAV Synth and SYNTH, the former having the worse tracking of the two.  But, since it also has the most varied programming parameters for synth-based sound creation you'll want to use it instead of the simple SYNTH modeler.
Guitar modeling is OK but, not as good as other units for sure - my Variax has a more realistic emulation of the various guitars, it has MORE models and MORE parameters to boot (such as pickup position, tilt, etc...) - and you can still hear a bit of a microphonic effect even with the GK pickup which is what they recommend using.  
Finally, their EDITING software is buggy at best and in some cases it and/or the drives don't install properly - the web it full of such complaints. IN my case, the installation program would hang even though Windows message would say, "You hardware is installed and ready to use" - well, BOSS's own program thought otherwise so, I couldn't get it to work on XP PRO, Vista or Win 8.1 - and once you read the super-long list of "issues" on Roland's own website you have to wonder how they couldn't find a capable company to write the drivers and editor for them.
I am returning mine today as I have just received the RMA - hopefully, something better will come along soon.                 
Pretty good, still needs some tweaking to get it to track just right - Can't really do what I wanted to do with this unit, Horns, was my main need - this unit doesn't fill it.GR-55 may be a better fit                
The reason I knocked the the sound quality a star and a half is because the preset sounds aren't EQ'd well at all. Compare it in videos to the Zoom and you'll see what I mean. That being said, once you get into it and 1)start tweeking yourself or 2) goto the Boss Tone Central you'll be fine. Boss Tone Central has some FANTASTIC user presets by pro guitarists. Once I found those I was very happy with sound quality, but you'd think they could of used some of these for their presets.                
The reamping feature is Dope and works great. At least with Reaper, which I also recommend. Had no issues getting the GT001 to talk to Reaper, easy as pie. Having the mic input it great and seems to work very well. The mic presets aren't super useful, but there not terrible either. Could use a few more bass presets...                
Easy to use, had a little trouble getting Boss tone central up and running, but once I did, can't live without it. But as far as just plug and play and jam, works like a charm. Menus are pretty straight forward.                
The knobs are fake metal plastic, but other than that its alright...would it really have broken the bank to throw some cheap metal in there?                
I compared this to several other items, the zoom being the one that almost won because the presets are really good. But, I use this for home desktop recording mostly and the BOSS GT001 is just superior to the zoom in that regard. The mic port with phantom power helped seal the deal, but the reamping feature is pretty sweet too...and once I found Tone Central the preset thing was a non issue.                
Haven't needed them so far.                
For the price point and for what I'm using it for, I'm super happy with it. I wish they had better presets right out of the box, BOSS if you are listening, maybe get some guitarist in there and let the engineers design the box and then lock them in the closet while the guitarist make the presets. But, thank goodness for Boss Tone Central, cause there are some great presets on there.                
Excellent Desktop recording solution.                
Very nice desktop unit for using with your DAW of choice. Use it with Presonus Studio One. it sounds great and easy to hook up with studio one. The amp settings are endless. it is the Boss GT-100 in a desktop version without foot pedals.                
The Boss GT-001 is a very good effects processor.  The Boss Tone Studio on line software app the connects via USB makes this processor very easy to use and find the tone that you are looking for. Although most patches are for Rock or Metal, there are several from associated Roland artists that can be used for other music types. The Roland companion software makes it very easy to modify or customize a tone or create your own tone and save to the library.  I definitely recommend this unit for anyone looking for a very useful guitar effects processor for their home recording studio.                 
I did not buy the Boss GT-1 from zzounds, but none the less this processor is amazing. Within the first half hour o was nothing but smiles from ear to ear. I am running this through two amps, one being a blackstar ht 40 and other being a roland blues cube stage 60. It sounds fantastic ran through two amps simultaneously. I coulsnt be happier.
Only issuse i habe with it is that i wish it had an on off switch instead of pluging and unpluging for the power.                 
I've had many effect pedals over the decades. I decided to buy the GT-1 and am very happy with it.The sound and especially the overall design.it's very easy to use                
   I have owned the Boss ME-33, Gt-6, and just recently upgraded to the Boss GT-100.  So because of that, I am only going by what I know.  This GT-100 has really impressed me...With the ease of use, the looks, and the TONE!!  I did a lot of research before pulling the trigger on this unit.  I looked at the POD 500HD, the Zoom G5, and the Mustang Floorboard.  To be honest, It was a hard choice between the POD500HD and the GT-100....but after receiving the GT-100 and plugging it in....It won me over Immediately. Online you will find forums where they
talk about the POD500HD being better as far as Amp Modeling....Don't let that fool you.  My Boss GT-100 sounds perfect!!  Yours will too!!  Manufacturer support?..I recently called them to assist in a programming situation, they were very helpful, and I didn't feel like I was "imposing" on them. zZounds....As always, your company and staff are wonderful, Thanks for everything.                
The Boss GT-100 is well made and looks awesome! The buttons are solid and you can't ask for better pedals. They are super quiet and sturdy. The dual display is great and it doesn't take too much time to figure it all out without having to read the manual. If I had to rate "User Friendly" from 1-10, 1 being "Difficult" and 10 being "Easy", I would give the Boss GT-100 a solid 8. The Boss GT-100 does lack a nice computer interface. The one that comes with it looks like it came out of Windows 95. Roland should definitely do something about that. Other than that, the GT-100 will give you hours of experimenting with endless sounds and tones... You're only limited by your own imagination.  Enjoy!      
Just got this pedal. Moving on from my GT-10. The 10 was great for studio recording via the digital IO. The 100 is a great improvement in a lot of areas, however; I'm not sure why BOSS left the SPDIF IO out of this. The software is similar to the Line 6 HD500X, but this pedal has the tones and sounds dialed in and it really doesn't take much tweaking ( if any). One last thing: I really l wish that all of these manufactures would emphasize the clean and jazz types of tones as much as they do the metal and rock style. Not all of your customers play that style.                
I have used individual pedals in the past and had grown used to them, but I always had my eye on this unit and decided to try it out and I really like it. If you decide to buy it I recommend messing with this thing for a couple of days, I made a couple patches that I like and use them all the time, to find your sound there are lots of digital knobs to tweak and pedals to shuffle around but this efx unit once you dial it in is worth every penny. Don't get frustrated, take your time and it will be well worth it.                
yes i bought mine here on zzounds 4 payments verses 3 elsewhere what can i say this thing is a monster and ive been writing a wider range of music than i did with my korg this will separate the men from the boys .not a fan of the exp.peddle as a wah ill stick to my morley. planing on getting a second for later on                
I play at my church on Sunday, so I needed something that could handle anything we do. D
I did have lots of money for a good tube amp that was large enough to complete with a b3 organ, keyboards, drums and bass. I also play keys as well. Using the gt100 through a keyboard amp is great, plenty of volume. Nice warm tones. Dose everything pretty good.                  
Just awesome. I've had just about every pedal out there and they were just ok. This one is amazing. I would recommend trying to make your own tones before purchasing some from people                
I picked this up knowing it was at the end of it's market life, but I wanted to finally own one.  COSM is starting to feel a little old, but it's still an amazing pedalboard.   The amp modeling is good, especially the clean tones.  The distortion can get a little "digital" sounding, but it's still very usable.  The effects are top notch, especially the delay and reverb.
What attracted me to this product was the routing options, specifically USB.  I do a lot of home recording on my DAW and an underappreciated feature of this board is the ability to record both a dry and wet signal to your DAW at the same time.  Reamping (routing the signal out of your DAW back into the device for processing after recording) is a great tool and something that is not found in a lot of boards.  It really gives this kit an extended life off the stage and in the studio.
6 years after launch this is still a great product!                 
Recently got the GT100, and Im really impressed how Boss has done its homework to improve the GT100 and make it really easy to use out of the box. Major upgrade in overall tone and ease, and its a snap to figure out how to use it. Definitely get this unit, dont waste money on other junk. Boss is the best DNA out there!                
First off I am not a professional and I do not tour.  I bought this for my Bass Guitar and although designed mainly for guitar, I was able to tweak and create some excellent patches for my bass!
This thing is rock solid with metal construction and I don't feel like I need to be gentle (I am though). 
As far as ZZ Sounds, get response, the item shipped as promised and arrived when scheduled.                 
The GT100 is a huge leap from the GT8, my last Boss processor.  I also own 2 other effects processor currently ( Line 6 HD500X & Digitech RP1000).  Although I love all 3 of them and they all sound great, the GT100 does have unique features the other 2 dont.  That's why I have 3 effects proccesors.  
The only complaint that I have about the G100 is that there is a learning curve when making patches.  I feel that the Line 6 & Digitech stuff is easier to program.
I just purchases from zZounds the Boss SY-300 and I can't wait to run in withe the GT100.                  
I was looking for a multi-efx pedal that could handle both acoustic and electric guitars. You'd think that in 2012 that should be easy, right? Well, not really.Let me start with the good stuff: The unit is SUPER easy to use. They really did a great job with the GUI - I haven't had to read the manual for any of its features and I was able to get into in-depth programming within a very few minutes of unpacking the unit.The clean sounds are honest and well defined - the reverb is ok but, not as good as the old BOSS SE50/70 for example - why??? I like the fact that the EQ has both LOW and HI freq FILTERS - a GREAT addition and it's available at all time.In essence the unit has a number of effect that are always available such as OD/DS, COMP., EQ, AMP, NR, DLY, CHR and REV. Then, there are 2 EFX modules which can be used to add a number of other effects. My gripe is that TWO is not always enough and I feel BOSS should have added at least a third.I am very picky about my sound so, I was really waiting to see how it would perform on clean patches, for both acoustic and electric. I have to say that I was ale to program a set of patches for my nylon and steel string acoustic that sound really natural, open and polished. No nasal overtones at all. I am impressed.I also like the clean patches I was able to program for my solid and hollow body electrics, for pop/rock and jazz. Was I don't like as much are the overdrive sounds. Just not convincing to me. To make them more palatable I had to really mess with EQ, compression and amp models.About the amp model: they do NOT sound anything like the amp they purport to represent, that's for sure. You will have to forget the "model" and imply listen for a sound you like. However, if you expect the "blackface" or "super tween" to sound anything like the real guys...forget it! Not even close. Just accept the models for what they are, not for what they are supposed to be :)For a "pro" product this unit lacks both on inputs and outputs. Should have had XLR as well as inputs for additional guitars. A big shortcoming in my opinion. Considering the Line 6 HD gives you that much and that all routing is programmable per patch, the BOSS lacks in this dept.Also lacking is support for more external pedal/switches - there is ONLY ONE, and you either plug an EXPRESSION pedal OR foot switches, but NOT both at the same time! Why? And only ONE AMP control jack - again, totally unacceptable these days. Further, no SPDIF out - again, the POD HD is way ahead of the BOSS GT-100 in this area.I was so disappointed that I had actually called Zzound to return it! However, I decided that accepting its limitations would allow me to have a unit that would sound great for CLEAN sound, for both my acoustic and electric guitars.I just have to wonder what BOSS what thinking when they designed this. They have been in the game for a long time and certain missing features should have been incorporated in this unit from the get go. It amazes me that they unit was designed without such basic features as an XLR out!                
I purchased the Boss GT-100 based on internet and YouTube reviews, which were very impressive. However, when I plugged-in and played-it, it sounded and felt like a cheap toy. Obviously an entry level floor processor mostly based on 80's era sounds. Also, the built in expression pedal was not working properly with some presets. I called Zzounds customer service and they instructed me to return it. The return process was very easy and hassle free. In my opinion....I do not recommend this product to any gigging musician. What I do recommend is to visit your local music store and try out the product until you're satisfied and then do the purchase. Internet review may be deceiving!!                
Sounds just like my Marshall. Also sounds like my twin.Very good rich tone. Actually responds to your pick like a tube amp.                
Efx are great. The ability to assign efx to the extra switch. Momentary or latching Can assign a different amp to each channel                
Very easy                
Built really tough. Something i have come to expect from boss.                
Worth every penny.                
No need to call                
Versatile and very easy to use.                
I purchased the gt 100 5 weeks ago. Im a full time musician and perform over 200 shows a year. i have always used Marshall amps and the maintenance has always been expensive and a pain to deal with. i run the gt 100 through a rocktron velocity power amp and a Marshall 412. It sounds amazing. Several local guitar players are looking to purchase and retire their tube amps after they have heard it. I have used the pod xt also the digitech rp500. The boss blows both of them away.Spend the extra money and get the boss gt100 it is superior in every way.                
Honestly idk what I was thinking when I bought this... Over priced and hard to use. It's interface is absolutely atrocious. If I'm gonna spend a lot of money on a unit, I'll buy a Line 6 Helix or Fractal. I love Boss pedals on there own, but this is just annoying.                
 I had line 6 hd 500 and rp 1000 and the boss gt 100 is the best out there for multi effects unit out there and the rp 1000 is the second best unit out there                
BEST PEDAL ON THE MARKET                
I like the BOSS GT-10 best because it has individual buttons for each of the effects so I can instantly see which effects are on/off (without having to scroll through a menu system) and edit each effect as well.  With the BOSS GT-10 you can instantly install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.  BOSS GT-10 Patches will not instantly install into a BOSS GT-100, JS-10, or JS-8 which makes you have to manually enter in all of the BOSS GT-10 patch settings.                
Amazing sound quality, anyone that says different has no clue what they’re talking about, doesn’t know how to use it properly or just a L6 HX fanboy (troll).  I’m using a Kiesel Vader V6X with Lithium pickups and an Alto TS312 pa speaker and Audio Technica AD-1000x for sound. Main AIRD output set to recording, IR’s selected within each patch.  Definitely not the easiest multi Fx to learn but well worth it IMO. The ability to switch patches with no delay without cutting off the previous patch is absolutely a must have in my opinion.  You can customize every aspect of the signal chain, even choose the mic and placement down to the cm. I even loaded a 24bit Patch of the Mega Boogle Rectifier built for the hx just to test, sounds great but 32bit AIRD is definitely a noticeable step up when listening through high quality headphones. FYI, a lot of reviewers of this product only purchased it to review and return it. They had not spent the time to learn the product and now spread false information about it. If it can be done this unit can probably do it.                
Before I purchased the GT-1000 I was skeptical because of the reviews and a lot of people I spoke pushed the Helix. But I noticed they're mostly using humbuckers and power chords. I play a Fender Strat and I do enjoy overdrive at times. But I spoke with Boss by email and told them my concerns about the amp models between the GT-1000 and Helix and they told me ....The GT-1000 is to compete with the LINE 6 Helix and we suggest quality not quantity of sound is most important to BOSS. So I purchased the GT-1000 and I tell you I absolutely love it. It is so easy to navigate through I had no problem getting usable sounds and I was able to duplicate the entire tone setup of my pedal board which has 9 pedals on it for different songs I play at gigs and I plan to use it live on Oct. 3rd. 2018 at Ceasers Palace LV for a live test run. I am very happy with the tone and Im able to get any sound that my pedals do and much much more thank you Boss your sound has been proven musician, garage band, bedroom and Live worthy once again.                
It's awesome, simply awesome. The size factor alone makes it a winner for me. What makes it a loser for me is that Boss did not include the dang power supply. Sure, I can and will (because I have to) order a PSA 120S 500mA power supply for this unit for @ $30.00, but if Boss was halfway thinking this through it probably would cost the consumer far less. All in all, zZounds was off the chain as far as customer service and speed in getting this little adapter-less piece of Heaven to me where Musician's Friend had me on hold for 7 minutes then hung up on me. 3 stars overall because of no included power supply. What were they thinking?                 
This a great pedal, though I would have to say most of the presets I wouldn't use I do see some players might find some of the stranger presets something they could use. I do like the ease of use, the pedal is really easy to configure, the options for configuring the pedal are a lot better then I expected. It's really versatile, I have been using the Boss GT-1B Pedal more then my Sansamp  in certain situations. I highly recommend the Boss GT-1B Bass Multi-Effects Processor. For the money it's a no brainer                
OK so loved the demo's and description. This does not come with any songs, only jam tracks. I had trouble loading iTunes from my collection. (convert to mp3 or wav) but once I call boss and spoke with tech support, (peter swiadon) they really care, help and stand behind their products, I was off and jamming. This unit is awesome! Practice, take it w/you play along your favorite songs, cancel out guitar, bass or vocals, record, slow down. Family and fiends always asking me to bring and play. Its like having your own band in a small portable box. Enough, sound for a small gig or plug into speakers. Would like to see a travel bag for this, it's made for that.                
The eBand JS-10 is a fun tool in my guitar practice arsenal. The sound is very good and can be used in small settings (such as a living room or Den etc.) to entertain friends. The features I like most are the wide variety of tones available and the ability to set your tones. I also like the size of the unit. It sits comfortably on the corner of my computer desk and can be moved to any area of my house with no trouble at all (actually easier than transporting any of my guitars). I like that it doesn't need to connect my computer sound system so I can play audio or video files on my computer and my music through the JS-10. I have a UX2, which I love, that I can't play with my audio and video philes without distorting the sounds. The SJ-10 has features that I haven't even begun to explore and I'm looking forward to using those as I develop my playing skills. Don't worry! The directions are fairly easy and clear on the use of each feature. I just like to explore one feature until I become fully adept at it and then move to the next. As a practice tool it is as good as it gets and if you don't have a lot of space it is even better. I takes up very little space and can be stored easily if you don't have a practice room just for your playing. Note: I would not have rated manufacturer support because I have not had to deal with any issues as yet but I was not allowed to not rate it at all. So I gave it 5 stars just to be positive.                
"Must have" is an overused expression. It should be reserved for appropriate use.  That said, if you play electric guitar, even casually, the JS 10 is a "Must Have".  
Of all the guitar related techno-gizmos that I own, none of them come close to hours logged on the JS10.  It's the ultimate practice tool (want to really learn the Pentatonics beyond the box?) and in-house performance tool.  The developers left no stone unturned.....If you read the product description you'll ask yourself, how can this all be possible for $400?  Well, it is!  My first unit was the JS-8...I thought that was the bomb.....then upgraded to the JS-10.....better yet.  I look forward to the JS-12 if that ever becomes a reality.  
So if you're an "at-home"  player that would like to sound like you're playing in a band and at the same time have multiple ways to improve your practice sessions, don't hesitate to treat yourself to this little gem.  Boss just nailed this item, dead on!
Over and Out
It's been really fun to just scroll through songs and play along. I have discovered my weaknesses and strengths when it comes to solo's. I'ts easy to operate and plenty of options. I haven't even scratched the surface as every time I get ready to start discovering I get caught up in playing instead. Definitely good for learning to improvise and stay in key....I'm glad I got it...Thanks Pay as you Play !!!!                
The JS 10 is easy to use, sounds great, and has many styles of music available to help find and get to know any holes in your theory or technique. It's plug in and play simplicity makes it a good tool for someone as averse to programming as I. I can't say enough about how good it is!                
I can't stop playing my guitar, there is so much to do with the Boss JS-10 it's unbelievable. This was one of my best investment ever I recommend this to everybody that needs help practicing.                
Excellent box and sounds, with the ability for me to download my own backing tracks to play with. As I'm a One man Band, as it were, its great for practice and I can also use the JS-10 as a USB user interface. I just got the unit so Ive only just begin to scratch the surface. zZounds as always gives me the support I need, and allows me to Play As I Pay like nobody else on the Music Store Circuit.                
I'm really a tube snob but needed a small amp fro practices and after trying out Orange and Vox I read the reviews and decided on this one. Totally exceeds my expectations! For a solid state amp it's just unbelievable! put it on the Brown sound and crank the gain and it sounds just about as good as my Marshall. Budda and Blackstar! Just a monster. Plus great acoustic sound. A total winner!                
If you are looking at this review then you are either just starting your search or have done some homework and are seeing what others think of the Boss Katana. Here is my experience.  I had read that this Boss Katana was a non Tube tone machine that not only sounded great out of the box but when plugged into a PC/MAC offered the ability to customize your sounds.   I found all of this to be true!   I own a few Tube amps.  My favorite is a Vox AC15.  I'm not saying the Katana is better or worse but on its own,  The Katana sounds amazing.  Crispy Clear tones to ripping crunch,  you will find a sound that works for you.  I ended up going with the Katana 100 over the 50 because the 100 offers the following additional features:  effects loop, Presence control knob, and 8 tone settings (version 2 software).  As far as volume goes,  the 100 Watt is like, Crazy Loud.  Thankfully both the 100 and 50 offer a master volume control and amp wattage settings. You can run the 100 on .05 watt, 50watt, or 100watt with no tone loss.   The Katana, again, is not a tube amp but it does have characteristics of breakup just like a tube provode and just sounds amazing.   To me,  I don't care what is under the hood,  if it sounds amazing and offers ear candy to me and others then problem solved.  Get a Katana and you'll be happy.                   
No kidding.  I've had several tube amps and the boss Katana 100w 1x12 sounds about as good as any of them.  No kidding.  Where this thing excels is its ability to sound great at any volume, the effects, light weight, cost, solid state durability, and USB interface.  
I checked out blackstar I'd, line 6 spider 5 and fender GT.  Non of these felt like a tube amp.  The Marshall code was the closest but isn't in the same class as the katana.  You can roll the volume knob back and the sound cleans right up.  It's loud as s#!% for a solid state amp.
Could use a tuner but that's it's only flaw.                  
Boss actually did it. I use A.R.T. DST 825`s 830`s and 8080`s.Manufactured from 97-99. They were over a grand new. Now they are aging and I have been looking for a suitable sound to give my aging non-repairable amps a rest. The Boss is slightly not as warm. But this amp is almost an exact duplicate sound wise. I have owned many Marshall tube amps including custom stacks that they only made a 200 limited run. I owned a Dumble modified 1974 Hiwatt Dr201. If I were to keep going this page would be full. This amp even produces tube harmonics. Where I goofed, I bought the 100 watt 1x12. So now I am going to decide to buy the 2x12 or the 100 watt head. Maybe even both? Look if you want a responsive amp? That will show your talent. Grab one. And I would recommend the 100 watt. They may say no, but there is a difference in sound between the power settings and the 100 watt setting is the best one. At times you can hear it is digital but you have to really have an ear. Definitely worth it and actually more. Get One or two!!! I will give support a 5 but will not need them. P.S. I ran every note I play through this amp , Near perfect sound not muddy or the digital fall apart most digital amps have. It took it. Made very well and the tilt foot is a good idea. I know my old Fender from 65-66 had the tilt arms, But Boss put lots of thought into this amp!                
This amp is the ultimate game changer. All those elusive tones I've been chasing have been captured. I've been giging with the Katana 100 for a little over a month now and my jcm 2000 half stack, Fender twin, and dual showman have taken a back seat. Light, powerful, awesome tones. I could go on and on. Tube dudes, stop tripin,  this is the best amp ever. Ordered Thursday and it came the next day. zZounds you da bomb.                
I've been looking for this amp for quite a while. I started with the line 6 modeling pedals, roland modeling pedals, something was missing, so I switched to a peavey modeling amp and all fell short. I was looking for a warmth, a chunk, a drive, whatever you might call it, it's a sound made by a tube amp, that just touching the strings you feel that power, that drive. Well, boss nailed it with this amp. My recordings are way clearer, now my guitar sounds with a professional grade. I bought a blemished version, I really didn't see anything wrong with it and saved big.  I also used the zZounds 4 payments option. Was shipped and received fast.                
I already have the 50 watt version which I love, but I needed something that has more push and headroom. The 100 watt with the single 12" speaker fits my needs perfectly. I like the added benefit of the presence control when using Humbuckers. People say these Katanas are digital, but they're not. The effects are, but the quality of said effects are fantastic. I'm so happy that the Katana has a built in Blues Driver. Excellent boost and overdrive. The overdrive channels are absolutely great and perfectly usable. I've read reviews that the Katana line doesn't model "boutique" amps very well. That's actually the beauty of this line. They have their own sound. Get into the sneaky amps if you want to model some amps. I fully enjoy the Katana's own unique sounds. The amp has plenty of power and clean headroom for most venues. It'll plug straight into a PA system if you need more sound coverage and saturation. I'm thrilled with this line of amps.                
I haven't done much if any reviews for anything ever. But this amp is definitely worthy of a few mins to hopefully help someone that may be thinking about this amp. I've had Line6 spiders, the Peavey Vyper when they first came out. Marshalls, the 5150 etc. all are freaking awesome but for a family guy that doesn't even play out, they're overkill. Hell, I recently sold off my newer Vyper2 after this little beast arrived at my door. The Katana sounds fantastic. Period. No matter what type of tone you're looking for, it's in this amp. You know that you like at least like some of the Boss pedals. Don't lie! Though I don't use many effects myself, there's enough to come up with any sounds you might want. At the same time, you don't need a degree in engineering to access everything. Plus, I don't need a thousand presets. Four should be enough for us mere mortals. The ability to make and save some to pull in with the software is plenty for me. It's also super easy to doThe software is straight forward. Yes, there's 55 pedals you can download and play with, and they're all easy enough to dial in. There is a setting in the interface that will put your effects in before or after the power section. And yes, you can absolutely hear the difference. Honestly, i did do a little reading on some of these pedals to help me really understand what they're really meant for and HOW to use them for myself. Effects loop is great to have. The aux in is what it is so don't expect too much when playing along with your device of choice. The output sounds good enough for basic use. A serious home studio type of person isn't looking to buy this product. That's fine. But this amp can get the job done. The 12" speaker seems good. Your neighbors could potentially hate you when you turn this thing up. Which brings me to the power selector. Basically, you can have that cranked up to freaking 11 sound at extremely low volumes. That's something that IMHO has been a feature that other amps in this category just suck at. Mine stays on the .5 watt setting most of the time. It's still loud enough to drown out most people's little sound bars and what not. My wife and kids can back me up that, lol. 50 watts will do with a drummer and bass player. 100 watts is the way to be, just as long as your other guitar player isn't bringing a half stack to the party, lol. This model has only one speaker so, duh... it will only get but so loud. Certainly the 2x12 is louder. It's not rocket science. It would have been nice to include a footswitch. Though for $99, it's cheap enough to buy later. It's interesting to me that you can add two expression pedals to that footswitch too. Though most of us are going to use our wah of choice here anyway. Am I right? Yes, i am. lol. I suppose I'd be open to getting one to use as a volume pedal. But that's why i put a treble bleed circuit in my Les Paul too. I only put a little electro harmonics boost and vox wah in front. I've tried a cpl if delays and chorus thru the loop. They sound great as expected but the delays built in are enough for my use. I'm not a modulation effect guy myself. At the end of the day, this amp should really please anyone. No matter their chosen genre of music. Best practice amp with built in effects available today. It takes pedals great. If you have a multi effect unit, go with the four cable connection. The damn Katana is the hot lick. Check it out!                
From Super clean to Brown, I love the sweet tones this amp produces. It has plenty of power and sounds fantastic at any volume. With all the built-in effects and Boss Tone Studio I am able to fully customize and set up 8 presets for quick access.                
I'm thoroughly enjoying this amp. Haven't gigged with it yet but i love the sound and effects. Struggling a bit with the online ToneCenter editting of the effects, but the amp itself is great.                 
It is true that this amp can put out very good tone- but it is limited. All of the extras that they added are not very good- think of this like a 2 channel tube amp without the tubes -if you want that then buy it...if you want to use it and set up a varied array of channels and sounds to play in a band that does a wide variety of music then this will not work for you.  I thought I was upgrading from the fender mustang- this amp does have a better clean tone and a slightly more natural punch, but it falls very short setting up channels and effects- the effects are not very good and the fact that if you select one of 3 pedal chains for the effects- that is the chain all of your saved sounds have to use.  I bought it with the foot controller- you can save 8 pre sets.. 2 banks of 4- but if you are on one channel and you want to be able take off an effect - you cannot switch to another channel without getting out of that effect mode- the mustang with the 2 pedal set up can go up and down your settings and also add/remove effects on the fly. again- if you aren't someone who needs to have a lot of different settings then this amp might be a good deal at 399$  you may be better off getting a few pedals to use- this amp is a good fit for pedals-
the one thing I did like on their software was the ability to select a premade tone from an upload and play it through the amp while connected to the computer without download.  I was very disappointed in the effects causing the horrible fuzz at the end of notes that most of these kinds of product do, and the noise gate included was as good as the one on the mustang.  I wanted to like this amp and be able to use it for gigs, but it did not offer what I needed.                
I was very frustrated in the begining, i couldn't get the amp to work with my Mac OS X, i needed to update the firmware before using it with tone studio, firmware update instructions were very confusing to say the least, after the update and tweaking on the screen for hours i got the amp to sound like anything i want, from easily best SRV sound i ever heard to Gary Moore Santana and even Metal stuff, also on high gain the amp is still becoming kinda fizzy, with headphones however the sound is less natural and a bit digital, but through the speaker the amp sounds very good, keep in mind you will need a lot of patience with this amp, it sounds pretty bad right out of the box, but once you get it hooked up to the tone studio, you can make it sound great.                
I Don't understand glowing reviews, must be Stockholm syndrome, yes it is inexpensive and gives you a lot on paper, but it sounds terrible, clean channel is good, everything else is just thin and brittle, every guitar sounds the same through this thing, every channel from crunch to brown is exactly the same but with added digital distortion the dynamics don't change at all, reverb is the worst i have heard since i started playing the guitar 25 years ago when i had digital zoom multi effects, brown channel however must be the worst one on this thing lol EVH would be laughing hard, 
i also run latest version of Sierra on my mac, and after downloading the driver and boss studio i have connected the amp only to be greeted by message that i must install updated software lol, well there isn't any i just installed it from roland's website, the amps is a joke and someone had to trash it, well let it be me. PS i also own Yamaha THR10x purchased from here as well, and it sounds magnificent with headphones or without, reverbs are insane and connectevity is a breeze, so there is digital technology that sounds as good as valves but in this amp, don't beleive paid you tubers and play one before you order it, i guarantee it will make your ears bleed.                
As with any new amp, there is usually sooo much hype in the beginning.  I wanted to wait until the honeymoon phase was over for the folks who had already bought one.  Well, I waited and the praise for this amp just kept on coming.  Right out of the box, this amp sounded HUGE.  As you have probably read on various forums, ~25 additional amps and numerous effects have already been unlocked within the firmware.  The Katana really cuts through the mix, and doesn't have the digital "artifacts" that plague other digital amps.  I'm just completely blown away.  Try a Katana, you have nothing to lose.  Roland certainly hit a home run with this one.......                
I did a lot of research before I purchased this amp. I could have got by with the one speaker, but I wanted two. I was going to say, "for the price" but  that is a injustice from where I sit. The tones and variations of tones is remarkable. The only other amp I would have bought is the Vox AC30, but the sound and price of this Boss was something I could not pass up.                
This amp is amazing!! It does home volume extremely well, while at the same time can literally drown out a drummer if you want to. You can only use three effects at a time, and one of those effects can only be reverb.. The effects are quite good with the weakest of the lot being the reverb.. The chorus is incredible and the booster distortion models are almost perfect!! The feel of this amp and the power section are the stars of the show!! I have done a few patch demos and other videos on my youtube channel... Check them out if you would like... Hubie H is the channel.
I was a bit skeptical but gave it a shot. Great tone out this amp for a solid state amp. Great for practice and playing in band setting. Iv done both and this thing is really loud and clear. Most solid state amps loose character when played at loud volumes. been playing for 25 years. Have played through probably every tube amp out there. I'm not saying this thing sounds exactly like a tube amp. It has the character of it though. Well worth the purchase. Iv had it for 2 months and there are so many tones i am still getting out of it. Give it a try Boss really out did themselves.                  
I have had many amps over the years, both solid-state & tube. This amp beats all solid-state amps I have owned. It is very responsive to your playing and the built-in effects are top notch. I can practice at a low wattage at home and not bother anybody or take to band practice and sound awesome at 50W...pedal friendly                
Just to be clear, I got the BOSS Katana-50 to use as a small, powerful, clean, full voiced amp platform for a modeling pedal (Fender Mustang Floor). For that purpose this amp would be tough to beat at any price, much less $199 IMHO. The on-board amp tones and effects are totally worthy, although I must say the all overdriven amp selections filter too much low end for my tastes. To be fair, it is sold as the Katana that will "Cut Through" as it says right on the factory carton. I use the "Clean" setting with the gain at about noon. It sounds great. BTW, I could totally use the amp as a grab and go. The on-board tones and effects are first rate. It's light, small, and loud in the right way. Recommended. P.S. I'm really hoping this amp proves to be as rugged and reliable as the other BOSS/Roland products I have owned and used. They have all been rock solid.                
I especially like the fact that it's easy to set up and play. No programming, just plug and play out of the box.  Depending on your style of music you should definitely take advantage of the software and update your presets.  the K50 now has the ability to store 4 presets (used to be only 2) via the software update.  I use a Boss FS-7 pedal to switch these 4.
Warning: this thing is LOUD. I really like the wattage feature to bring it down when playing at home.
My only complaint about the K50 is the lack of an FX loop.  I have a very old Dean Markley (oddly, named K50 as well) that has FX loop, line out, etc. Although the K50 takes pedals well, not having the FX loop limits the use of a looper pedal, which I often use. If you use any type of looper, you know what I mean. And again, using pedals only to layer effects over effects outside of the programmable ones via the software.  I have a few TC Electronic effects (Dark Matter, Dreamscape, Mini Comp) that I prefer over Boss.
Would still recommend the Katana as it sounds very good, especially after you've dialed in your tones and presets.  From what I've read, it gets better after the speaker breaks in.
Disclaimer:  the unit I received was making a crackling noise as if there was a loose instrument cable shorting out, poor grounding, or a 'confused' noise gate. I tried several guitars, cables, power outlets and it still had the noise. Mostly noticeable while not playing, just plugged in. I've returned it to Zzounds and a new unit is on its way.                
I recently received the  Katana 50 and shortly after sold my Bugera V22 and my Yamaha THR5. the ease of use of this amp is great, and it does sound great after you take your time to dial it in.  IMHO its much better sounding the Roland cube amp (excluding the blues cubes) the effects are good but they are Boss so if you dont like boss effects, you might want to try some pedals. I have not tried pedals in it but from my understanding, it takes them well. its a very light amp, Which makes it feel cheaper to me. and the only reason i knocked features down a little is that it would have been nice to have a tuner on it.   the facts that i can change the wattage is fantastic and it does sound good at lower volumes but i have noticed that it reacts as a tube amp would in that it sounds better turned up.  If you are a gigging musician go for the 100 watt i think it would be better for the clean channel to cut through the mix.
it sounds great and could very well replace your cheaper tube amps (bugera come to mind) but it certainly will not replace my mesa boogie express.                 
I bought this as a practice amp. I haven't used it outside of my house, but I have no doubt it could keep up with a drummer for band practice, a small gig, or a larger gig if mic'd up. 
All of the amp models sound great. I love the effects. I would be nice if there were more options for running the effects together however you want, but that's probably reserved for the 100 watt version. It took a few minutes to understand how the effects knobs worked, but it was fairly intuitive. The amps real potential opens up once you hook it up to your computer with the not-included OMNIHIL/usb cable. 
It would have been nice for Boss to include the footswitch instead of it being an optional extra purchase. It's not really needed if you're jamming at your house alone, but I would want one for a gig.
Overall, this thing rocks. I'd definitely recommend it. This solid state stuff has come so far compared to the old Peavey transtube stuff my friends and I had way back in high school.                 
This amp is great. It clear at all volumes and gets very close to the tube sound. Great tones and very loud. Also, the 5 different channels are great as well as the effects on the amp and being able to download from the Boss Studio. zZounds was great. 4 payment of $55 no credit check. Awesome. Nothing touches this amp for the price. Even more expensive ones aren't as good.                
I'll be really quick with this. It's a great amp,perfect for playing at home, I guarantee loud enough for a drummer.  I haven't gotten too far into the effects or computer stuff yet, but this is really split and play amp. Its not trying to sound like a jcm or a fender or a Mesa, it just sounds GREAT. I've owned plenty of other amps, orange, Marshall, Peavey tube amps, and this amp can compete for tone.
Bottom line is I WISH we had this sort of stuff when I was learning to play. Technology has come VERY far.                
Great amp. 50 watts with a 12" speaker,  amazing sounding onboard effects (Boss brand too!!). I can't turn the volume up past .5 (1/2) or else the neighbors complain. it has the power for gigs.  Clean channel is really crisp, bright and clear.  The overdrive channels are great also.  You can get basically any tone from this amp with the right twerking.  Definitely worth the money.                 
Boss Katana-50 is a nice little light weight practice amp that sounds decent enough. Got tired of dragging 40lb+ amps around for weekly practices. Also tired of putting my gigging amps through the wear and tear and daily practice grind. You have to play with it for awhile to dial in the sounds you need but this little 50w amp gets it done. I use mainly for practice at home and I have even used it at our regular weekly band practice and it will keep up and it will cut through the mix. It doesn't sound totally awesome but for the price and ease of use, it ain't too bad!                
I'll list the CONS first.- I think there's something wrong with the default software. When you turn the amp back on, it starts on different settings then what everythin' is turned to.There's free software on their website to connect a computer to. It's really a minor setback for the value of this amp.- The clean channel doesn't want to work with my Ibanez AS73, but the acoustic channel does the trick.-Remembering all your settings after if you tweak the other amp styles. This just takes a week or so to get used to.PROS:-Lots of varied sounds, especially because my guitar has 2 tone and 2 volume knob won the a 3 position switch.-Plenty loud for anyone wanting to get that feel of playing live, loud concerts.-Great price at $220.                
Between this technology and Quilter, there really are toneful options to Tube Amps. Some time and experimenting is needed to get things dialed in properly because the settings are very responsive and interactive. If this model had a true line out, it would be a perfect small venue amp. I have used it on large stages with a mic and it pushes a lot of air for its size. I never bring my heavy to e machines anymore to live gigs                
This is an addendum to my other review above. I have found "peace" with respect to taking advantage of the Katana Air's wireless capabilities. When used in the house, which is how I use it exclusively, I simply leave the amp itself plugged into the wall and fully charge the transmitter. I then plug it into my guitar of choice and leave it there. The light should glow green when plugged into ones guitar. When done using it, hang up your guitar and let the transmitter be. It will power down until you pick up the guitar again. I also press the Power Button on the amp until it is the only button illuminated. It glows orange and is the only button lit on the panel. If you've fresh batteries. you certainly can disconnect from the wall plug and go truly wireless......you give up 30 watt output for 20 watts when running on batteries and charge time for the transmitter becomes less predictable. All things considered, the Katana Air is a unique item, that once understood by its owner can be indeed liberating.                
I may be mis-reading the manual but I've yet to figure out how to keep the wireless transmitter charged. I'm not new at this having gotten Line 6's wireless transmitters when they first arrived on the scene. They were easy to use and worked as advertised. While I am a huge Roland/Boss fan, I'm thinking they may have missed the mark in the "ease of use" category on the Katana Air. From a sound perspective, the amp, when plugged into a wall socket sounds great; just what you'd expect from a Katana amp. And when the transmitter is fully charged, the same can be expected. The problem arises when trying to figure out how to keep it charged. When running the amp on batteries only, this seems this seems to be problematic in that the amp stops charging the transmitter when the batteries are low. The problem is you don't know the transmitter is dead until you try and use it.My most predictable approach is to plug in the amp with the provided DC cable and do my charging while the amp is "hard-wired" to the juice coming from a wall socket.Once the transmitter is fully charged, in this manner, I can disconnect the amp and run it on a fresh set of batteries. This will afford you a "temporary" wireless operation. The transmitter that I received didn't have any where's near the claimed lifespan. I'd be curious to see how other's experience with the Katana Air played out. I will keep fiddling with the KA and if I discover what it takes to make it truly wireless, I'll get back to you in a follow up review. Strangely I did keep this item, hoping for a downloadable software cure.There is a nice free ap that accompanies the KA.....It allows you to change all of the amp's audio settings and to download free patch sets. This works well with my iPhone 7+.                
I am very happy I got this amp. I haven't bought a new combo amp for a long time so I figured now was a good time seeing all the praise for this thing. When I first got it I thought it sounded good... a few nights of playing and it sounds awesome. The knobs are very sensitive and you can get a bunch of different tones with a lot of patient tweaking. The speaker also sounds great after a few days of consistent playing. So far my favorite rock/shred tone is the crunch with limited gain and the overdrive at the lowest setting. Very clear and fine attack with great tone. I have not used the delays, reverb and chorus to a great extent but they sound fine so far. Very easy to use and practical. I am also a classical guitarist and will try out my contact microphone through the acoustic channel at some point and a cheaper guitar with a built in mic. Great amp, great deal with the foot switch as well!                
I stoped gigging many years ago and got rid of all of my tube amps (marshall, fender, peavey, carvin).  The past years I have just been recording music at home and I run my guitar through my studio and processors which worked well for me. I decided that maybe it is time to buy a small amp for more depth.  I am a huge fan of boss effects and I heard alot of good things about the Katana series amps.  When the Katan Artist amp was announced I knew that I had to get one.  I am in no way disappointed at all with this amp.  I bought the big footswitch and the optional bank switch pedal and now I have an 8 channel amp.  This is a great.  The ToneStudio software is awesome too, I have been using it for a few years now with my other boss equipment.  This amp is loud, but I have to use it on the lowest power setting as I live in a condo and I don't want to piss off the neighbors, but everyonce and I while I'll crank it up and it sounds fantastic.  It loves my other pedals and sounds so clean.  A very good alternative to a tube amp.  Plus it's not that heavy either.                
One of the best solid-state amp deals on the planet. I use the Panel setting channel, the one that works like a regular knob-turning amp head delight, for my pedal board. I use the 4 channel footswitch, sold extra, to control the 4 pre-set channels. Except, BOSS upgraded the firmware for Katana head and it holds 8 pre-set channels,all accessed via footswitch. The software, Boss Tone Central, works flawlessly if you follow directions. Amazing control of genuine BOSS pedals inside this here amp! I use the on-board speaker for a practice amp but we  have a 1-10" cab, a 2-12" cab, and a 4-12" cab to use when needed. This amp rocks them all.                 
Hard to update, but man this thing sounds exactly the way I want to sound both recording and playing it through my 4x12 cab, I just plug it from my Rec Out to my Universal audio MKII Interface and thats it WOW such a Big rock sound and clean or Heavy WOW! I found my sound after buying a million Guitar plugins, Thanks Boss                
Your not going to find a better amp for the money.  I know it sounds cliche but it's the truth.  If your a fan of Boss pedals, you're in for a real treat.  They're built in!  There is software to tweak this.  There were Win10 issues but I believe they have been fixed.  And even with out the software, you can tweak various built in effects and save them and then recall the whole recipe with a push of a button.  I do that a lot!  I wish there were more storage buttons!  And for a solid state amp the tones are pretty amazing for all genres.                
This amp kicks azz. Watch some reviews on YouTube. Amazing range of tones and affects. I don't believe there is a tone this amp can't make, its that good. Love it. Thanks again for the great price and fast shipping zZounds!

I just purchased a Boss Katana head and I am very disappointed to find that Boss Tone Central is currently unavailable for windows.  Boss Tone Central is the primary interface for editing and programming effects with this amplifier and let me repeat myself on this: IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS COMPUTERS.
The amp DOES NOT COME WITH THE SOFTWARE.  The software is only available for download and is currently only available for IOS operating systems.
 How am I supposed to make the most of this amp when the most important part of the modeling interface is completely unavailable?
This key flaw makes the modeling aspect of this amp virtually useless.
I would also like to bring up another key flaw that makes this product less appealing compared to other amplifiers in this price range. This amp does not come with a footswitch. Even more troublesome for customers like myself, the Roland GA-FC (currently priced at $99 US dollars) is still on back order at every major music retailer. 
The lack of availability of a foot switch plus the extra cost of the footswitch itself makes this amp very undesirable in comparison to other amplifiers in this price range.
I am very tempted at this point to return this product.  Boss has really dropped the ball on this one.
I could have bought a Fender Mustang V for $50 less and none of this would be an issue.  All of the Fender Mustangs effects and modeling/editing features are built right into the amp.  Not only does the Fender Mustang come with a footswitch, it even comes with a built in tuner.  Needless to say, the Boss Katana does not even have that simple feature.  
The Boss Katana Head is neither a symbol of honor or precision as their slogan reads, but rather the epitome of complete incompetence from the Boss/Roland corporation.
Take my advice, either get a Fender Mustang V or a Line 6 Spider IV because this amp is trash.                
Simply put, Boss' new Katana Mini has assumed top of the hill status when considering a small, light weight amp that has an assortment of convincing tones and effects and can run on batteries alone. The previous fly weight contender, the 5 watt Black Star Fly, will now be relegated to the bargain table. Boss added two watts, extra voices and managed to maintain its fly (feather) weight status. For a small inexpensive practice amp, it will be tough to beat the Katana Mini. In fact at the moment consider this new Boss offering to be the King of the Hill in the Fly weight class. And yes, you can purchase an AC adapter if batteries don't do it for you. Hats off to Boss. They get it!!                
I own the Katana head and I love it. Run that bad boy through a vintage Marshall 4x12 and it’s magical, however sometimes I want to sit and watch a movie while shredding and this is was my solution. Shred at the office. Shred at the beach. Shred in space. No limits! 
The sound quality is wonderful and this little champion pumps out some serious volume. The clean channel sparkles while the crunch channel sounds so frickin’ AC/DC it’s not even funny. It responds well to your playing for actual musical dynamics. The Brown channel is great and does what it should but I loooove the crunch on this mini better. Metal heads will not be disappointed though, it gets the job done for practice purposes without ruining inspiration like the horrible Line 6 things. 
The delay on the amp is simple and great. I wish they would have squeezed reverb in as well but we have pedals for that if necessary. 
Once again BOSS does it again for a price so low it’s practically free.                
Clean crunch and brown you can get a good tone out of all 3. Delay is ok. Turn down the time and crank the level and u got reverb kind of. I have the Blackstar fly 3 and its dam good for the money. Imho the katana surpasses the fly 3. This box rawks. I played it for 3 hours when i got it. Tried it with Duncan JB/59 then EMG retro active humbuckers and active single coils. Then my deluxe Roadhouse strat. Then Dimarzio in my vintage Talon II... There's a reason people are talking about the Katana. I could tell you but if you buy one you will know why immediately. Get it from zZounds and your good to go. Got mine in 1 day and no shipping charge. Thanx zZounds. The Katana mini put a smile on my face. Almost as good as sex lol err um not really but it will make u wanna play. Get one now.                
I have been using this for a few weeks now and I love it's flexibility. I have used it as both a standard A/B/Bypass switch and as basically an on board mixer. As a pedal board mixer, it basically works like a Blender. I dial line A in at about -25% and keep line B (my main effects line) at 12'o clock and i can mix in my ambient effects without drowning out my main sound. This is a great feature for me...The flaw? It doesn't have a "Y" setting in the A/B loop. So I cannot go from A to B to A&B combined. If I want to use A&B combined (like the Blender example above), it only goes between A&B and Bypass.                
I had a problem w/ my BD 2 amping up so much louder than my other pedals that my volume pedal was useless.  I tried turning down volume on my GE 7 but that affected the tone.
I tried out this unit, ran it thru A channel and my MM 4 looped thru B and everything else straight thru.
The result is a balanced sound and I didn't lose that wonderful BD2 tone!!                
I like the ability to switch between 2 channels and simultaneously use other pedals w/ each channel.  I like the separate volume controls.  It's a dream and I'm getting one!                
It's Boss, built like a tank and built quality.  What else can you say?                
It's on sale now for around $80.  Great deal. 
I'm not real sure about other brands.  I'm a BOSS man mostly.                
Yes.  I called Boss because of my volume problems.  After talking to the tech he recommended this unit.  Guess what?  He was dead on RIGHT!  
I like that :D                
sex appeal?  Get real!  But I really do want it!                
I don't anticipate replacing it.  If I did my wife would kill me LOL                
Does exactly what it's suppose to and  has that Boss durability.                
When your ready to admit your a pure pedal addict, this is the "no-noise", "no-click" solution !....lets you keep yourGATE SETTINGS at every volume!!!!!!BUY THIS  the get George L's.... and wire two channels without fear off noise or loose !!!!                
I really don't have anything else to compare the sound to, but, I really like the quality switching of the LS-2.                
This pedal does exactly what I wanted it to do, switch two acoustic guitars with pickups on and off and allow me to set the level of each.  We now have two LS-2 in series for switching three guitars on and off.  I call the LS-2 my floor mini-mixer.                
Piece of cake to setup and use.  With two LS-2s we can switch three or four guitars on and off quickly.                
Is this product made well?  It's a Boss pedal, it really is built to last.                
We all want things to be cheaper these days, I think this pedal is a pretty good value.  A simple switch may have worked in our application, but the features of this pedal made the cost worth it for me.                
A pedal is a pedal is a pedal to me.  It works and it works well, that's what I am really interested in.                
I expect this pedal will be used for a LONG time.  I can't imagine playing without it.  I do wish it had a mode for passing the A+B inputs to either the A, B or OUT outputs, but I have easily learned to work around that.  It would be a great feature though.                
I really don't think I could undersell you on this pedal. For the price of one high end "boutique" modulation pedal you get a vast array of modulation tones ranging from the must haves to the ones you never knew you wanted until you hear them on the MD 500. All of the presets sound incredible and give you an excellent idea of what this pedal is capable of, the only effects I've been underwhelmed by are the Univibe and Rotary effects, to my ears those two are far from faithful to the originals and sound quite bad. The chorus, flanger, phaser and octave are all top notch and could easily take down many of their analog counterparts. I mean the sound is so pristine it's almost 3D. I've only just begun to edit my own patches but so far I have indeed been able to dial in perfect versions of each effect for basically any situation you can think of, the versatility of this thing is nearly endless. You can recreate damn near any chorus etc tone you can think of and edit parameters not found outside a studio usually. I know I'm rambling so I'll just close out the review by stating that I could easily see this being the last modulation pedal I'll ever need. I prefer analog delay hands down, so I didn't bond with the DD 500, my reverb needs are limited to spring (which I have), but for modulation effects like chorus, I may just prefer digital now. Never thought I'd say that, but it's true (with this pedal).                
As soon as I plugged in the pedal, the first words out of my mouth were... "damn". This thing is nice! It gives you alot of tone, that was somthing that I wasn't expecting when I got it. The pedal is built nice. The volume/effects pedal itself has a nice feel to it, lots of control nice up and down movement. The tuner is great.                
Compressor/Limiter - Lots of control. These are nice but some of them you can't tell the differnce between them.
Distortion/Synth - The Distortions are good, snyth's are kinda lame... but I don't play techno so who cares?
Delay/Modulation - The Delay is kick ass I fun messing with that. Flange is good, Phaser is great, Chorus and Delay = My favorite effect.
Filter/Tone - The Tone pedals defretter, wha, and enhancer are great also. Wha effects on the expresion pedal are nice, the octaves are not worthy to a digitech whammy pedal but close.
Expresion Pedal - The Wah pedal is good, Resonance can give you some really wierd sounds, the Octaves on the expression pedal are great to mess with, soundhold is a good pratice tool, and the Kick drum effect is by far one of the coolest things to use to practice or rub in your drummers face.                
Built great.                
This is worth every penny. I love this pedal!                
Good support just go to there site and you find any information you need.                
Everyone that I have shown it too has had nothing but good things to say, after they caught there breath again.                
I'll be satisfied for a long time I do believe                
It's a great gizmo for bass players of all abilities. easy to use and very versatile. I have been gigging with it for about a year now and I think it's worth every penny!                
I was surprised at how good this pedal sounds.... It has all the useful effects that a bassist would need.... The thing is built like a tank... I highly recommend it to anyone who is tired of having to handle a ton of pedals and cords...                
I just got this a few days ago but, I've been playing with it non stop. This thing is great. I'm running it from the output into a Red Box classic on the 1x12 setting and, then to the board for late night headphone jamming and recording. It's awesome for this. Way better then amp sims. The filter section isn't of much use to me and the delay modulation I pretty much use just a small touch of chorus otherwise the rest is wasted on me. The volume/wah pedal mean nothing to me either I don't use them. The distortions are great, those I do use. They give you bass specific distortions without sucking the low end out of my tone. The eq and compressor sections are worth the price of admission alone. Smooth useable bass tones from this section. The compressor section is amazing. Bass compression with multiple flavors that all work as advertised. The noise suppressor dial on the back of the unit is also very worth mentioning although almost nobody does. It's very effective and quiets my little Mustang bass right up. I'm getting awesome tone straight to the board and into my DAW using the combo of this unit and the Red Box. I highly recommend this combo to anybody trying to work late at night without waking up the neighbors. I expect this unit to last a very long time as with all my Boss products. I'm still using a couple of Boss half rack effects from the 80's in my vocal rig. Still got Boss pedals from that era in the line up as well. Never actually owned a Boss product that quit working for anything other then user error. Like when my ex threw my chorus pedal in the lake.                 
This unit sounds amazing.  I bought it mostly for its distortions, but using other effects in combonation with distortion can get you some very harsh tones, and some more usable ones.  I think you could use this with any kind of music.  I dont think I will ever need another pedal.                  
The big feature on the ME-50B is dedicated knobs for each effects section.  This makes things very easy to understand, especially if you are working with 2 or more effects.  I am still a little sore that boss pedals just dont come with the AC adapter.  Everybody buys one.                
This pedal is invincible.  All the knobs are tough, and so is the expression pedal.  Its perfect for on stage use.                
For all the effects jammed into here, this is the best value you will find.                
Its got so much cool stuff that you just have to have it. I probably wont ever find any usable effects out of half the stuff... but i still love messing around with it.                
This products is amazing.  If you buy it you will not be dissapointed.  This is the perfect toneshaping device, and it dosent have all that amp/cab stuff that you wont use anyway to jack up the price tag.                
I've owned a couple of fx boxes but this one is pretty sweet.  Just the right amount of effects and a built in expression pedal.  Good times.                
Expression pedal, built in 4 band eq w/ master level, lots of compression options, noise suppressor, easy interface, quick editing at your fingertips, and tons of effects.  Yeah this thing is freakin sick.  There is so much noise you can generate that it's silly.  SILLY!                  
Heavy.  Metal.  Blue.  This thing is meant to be stepped on, remember?                
You bet.  If $300 is burning a hole in your wallet then get this thing.  You'll be glad you did.                
No problems at all - but if this thing is truly boss then I don't see one anytime soon.                
Oooooh yeah ... get some!                
If you have some dough laying around then do yourself a favor and get it.  Trust me, you'll poop when you get your hands on it.  I doubt I'm going to need to get anything to replace this.                
Awesome distortions and phaser/flanger sounds. Love the expression pedal. I like the t-wah for funky stuff. Defretter is great!                
i really like the knob-based design of this unit. I can dial up any sound I want in a minute or two. The unit should come with a power supply instead of batteries. everyone is going to buy the wall-wart anyway.                
Really easy to dial up any sound and write it to a bank. One read through the manual had me going quickly.                
The usual Boss quality. Made for stage use.                
If you're looking for an easy to use multi effects unit, this one is it! You get great sounds by turning the knobs and you don't need to be a software wiz to use it.                
Haven't needed it yet, but I would expect nothing less from Boss.                
Put it this way: I went in looking for a bass POD XT LIVE, and left with this one.                 
I don't expect to buy another multi-effects unit. Ever. This is it.                
Has everything you will need. You can program it to your specs. Good quality. Has expression pedal. Get the power supply, batteries ware out quickly.                
Too bad it's all digital but they did a good job concidering that. Only the synth part is really dodgy, you need to change all settings to get that sounding good. But it's usable wheter you play funk, jazz, rock or pop. I'm not too sure about metal, since it hasn't got any really dark things, but I don't play metal anyway so f^$& that.                 
All made of metal so it's a tank, the usual boss quality. Very useful is the expression pedal, compression and the tuner is also very welcome. It hasn't got amp modeling, but the effects have been given better attention to. 
If you have a 2 option footswitch use it, instead of buying 2 FU-5's. My amp switch works on it.                 
Tank built. No more to say.                 
A bit expensive, but when you've bought it, really worth it's price.                 
Never had to deal with them ,but for what I've heard boss has a good customer service                
It looks really attractive, since it's only turning knobs, and little menu's to scroll through. When you've bought the footswitches it's even easier. The colour is dark blue, lighter than the guitar version. Looks good                
Just another great pedal by boss, especially when you don't want to buy all analog pedals. This covers most needs.                 
I haven't used many bass effects pedals, so can't say "the best", but of the ones I've used, and after messing with various guitar effcts with bass, I have to say I'm very satisfied.                
Again, haven't used them all, so can't say "best", but it's got more than I'll ever use. Compression is great, distortions are smooth and obviously tailored to bass. Chorus, delay, flange and phaser sound good. Wah lacks character (I'm not even sure what I mean by that), but for my rare use is adequate.                
Very easy to set up. That's why I wanted knobs instead of menus. Plays well with others (I use it to record into a DAW. Beats the devil out of the available amp sims such as SVX and Guitar Rig). There's always a learning curve, but all ya gotta do is lean down and turn a knob, not memorize a freakin' computer interface!                
Have used Boss products forever. Built like a tank, never had a problem (I also have a ME70 that I've had for a while).                
Yes, though it could've come with an ac adapter.                
The best support is the one you never need.                
This is a "toy". I don't need it to make good music (been playing over 40 years). It adds "color" and is fun to play with, make freaky noises and such. I Like it! That said, I probably wouldn't have bought it if it was pink, yellow or green. The dark blue color is perfect.                
Can't imagine needing anything else for bass, but you never know. If it disappeared I'd replace it in a minute.                
Having owned 2 Boss floor processors (GT-3, GT-8) I must say I could not be more unhappy with this garbage. If Zzounds offered any other bass floor processor with more than a couple effects and an expression pedal, I'd have sent it back and got something different. It reminds me of one of the cheaper junk guitar processors in the $150 range, really stripped down on the functionality. As it was, I was stuck needing something quick, so yeah... zZounds, you do a great job otherwise; please offer a bass multi fx unit that isn't either minimal fx choices with good quality, or a bunch of crap jammed in a box like I grossly overpaid for. If you do, I'll buy it.                
Got sounds that you would expect from a boss pedal.  A lot of great sounds, and some that are not needed.                
Great features.  Solid EQ, solid sound.  Expression pedal is excellent!! Just doesnt come with a power adapter.                
The knobs and controls are so easy.  No need for a manual (but read it anyway).                
Tough boss construction.  The expression pedal could have better feel though.                
$300 is a lot, but well worth it.                
Havent needed any.                
Super hot sounding and hot looking.  Can you ask for more.                
EQ, Compresser, Chorus/Delays, Octaver and Tube Drive emulation very good sounding.  Less impressive are the synth sounds.                  
Tuner and Volume/Expression pedal are handy.  It would be nice if it didn't use a "wall wart", as the thin cord could be damaged onstage.  Also would have been nice to include a transport case.
This unit doesn't include the amp modeling features popular in many units on the market these days.  That's fine with me, as I don't find amp/speaker modeling useful for my needs.                
Solid Boss construction we've come to expect.                  
Never had a problem with a Boss product, so who knows?                
I've been checking out Bass Multi-Effects units and Preamps with built-in effects for a few years now.  Either they felt like cheap plastic, or the preamp sections sounded lousy, or the thing would be a nightmare of buried menus.  
The Boss ME-50B was impressive enough to take home on trial, then purchase later the same day.                
I'll be surprised if this unit isn't embraced by bassists in various styles of
music.  I don't think that amp modeling is a priority for most bassists, and by leaving out that feature, Boss has created a smaller, simpler multi-effects unit.                
Plug a set of ear buds into the headphone jack and leave them on the floor. plug left/mono out to your clean channel amp set straight up. Let the ME80 do all the work.   This is how i play live with it and it sounds great using the preamp section instead of my cabs gains/effects/lead channel.  Works for me.                
Love the tuner, the whammy, the terra echo, the presets actually sound good too.  I go to some of them as is.                 
Very easy for experienced pedal users.  I could see it being overwhelming for a beginner.  Watch videos, all of them.                  
Very sturdy, it is an electronic and nothing is certain with electronics. Until it dies im going to play it and not worry about that.                 
Worth every penny.  I bought a Digitech Whammy a few years ago for $150. This has that and like 60 other effects, tuner, its endless.  The terra echo, delays, univibe, reverse, compressors, wah, its crazy how worth it it is.                  
No need for support, yet. Im sure I wont need it.                 
Ive pretty much said it all.  It has everything i need. I love it.                 
The ME 80 is amazing (for me).  Very easy to use(for me).  Ive been playing for 20 years and have owned various amps, pedals, guitars etc and this is by far the most fun ive had playing in 20 years.  It has everything I could ask for. I personally like the distortions, they sound great.  My band mates love the sounds its throwing.   The batteries have lasted me 7-8 hours of playing so far and the 'low battery' light still has yet to come on.  Built in tuner is really nice and the whole product is very hiss and buzz free.   It is actually helping me be a better and more artistic player.                  
This box has it all and I am very satisfied with the sounds, and may I add so many sounds that I'll never use them all, that this pedal has. Great Great  Great. Thanks for making this item to use at the touch of a button. Great for the Money.......                
This pedal will not let you down, you get every sound you can dream of. I really like the overtone setting. It's built very rugged, it'll withstand what you throw at it. And with Boss tone central, you can dial in a variety of tones, I'm very satisfied with my purchase!                
I had originally ordered the me-70 but it was put on back order. I was interested in the boss tera echo pedal and saw the me-80 had it as an integrated effect. I am very pleased with the pedal. Its very heavy duty, and adjusting the effects is super easy. I wanted this type of pedal because twisting knobs is just handier than going through buttons. The integrated tuner is also nice to have. Sound wise the options are incredible. I really enjoy the Bogner high gain cab model using the Tera echo and a second delay. A wall of crunchy waves of sound. Some effects I'll never use. But its nice to have them in your arsenal should you get the itch. Overall a good solid pedal. The usual great boss tones. All in one large package.                
Granted, this isn't a RP100 or some $500+ effects system, but for the price this thing is great. Not terribly complicated and the ease of changing things on the fly with the bevy of knobs is frickin sweet. No scrolling through menus and not knowing exactly what you're changing is fabulous. It emulates a large selection of Boss pedals very convincingly and as I said before... you can't beat the price.                
This is a rock solid effects unit. I chose the ME-80 over the BOSS GT-100 to avoid having to navigate sub menus within the LCD displays. It's a personal preference for me to dial in sounds with knobs rather than shape sounds through digital drop down menus and generic parameters pictures offered with LCD screens. Now, I am an analogue guy when it comes to superb sonic quality/character when using dynamics/time based effects. As most pedal junkies know, an analogue pedal board gets pretty crazy over time and you have to ask,"is this a realistic set up for my purposes?" Well, for me it made more sense to have a consolidated palet of very good quality BOSS effects rather than expand my simple 2 pedal analogue effects chain. I loved my analogue delay and analogue envelope phaser set up, but how often can you use a pristine sounding analogue envelope filter? . It's one of those effects that in my opinion should be used in moderation. On the subject of envelope filters, the ME-80 has this feature labeled as up wah in the compressor section of the effects unit. Yes, it's much more difficult to dial in the sensitivity and response with the BOSS up wah/envelope filter but this is where the BOSS tone central came in to the rescue. Bottom line, you definitely get what you pay for and much, much more with the ME-80. Take the almost limitless possibilities offered on board the ME-80 and add the BOSS tone central feature and you are covered from every angle in the effects department. The BOSS tone central has an enormous amount of sonically insane effects that are also very practical in use. We all know some multi effects units have sounds that really have little place for use within the framework of constructed songs or compositions but may be used in some sort of ambient,sound scape piece. Last feed back for the ME-80 is volume levels between different effects.I read a number of similar reviews about how this unit is troublesome with volume levels from one effect to the other. I took time to focus on this issue and here's what I figured out about the volume issues: Gain strucutre in a common term used in recording studios. So, since this unit has a manual mode, user preset mode and factory preset mode I started working out the volume issue. First off, the consistency between user presets ( imported from BOSS tone central) and factory presets were very consistent. Nowever, in manual mode volume levels were all over the place. I isolated this problem to the pre amp section of the ME-80 when setting gain structure in manual mode. Here's how I approached setting proper gain structure: first, engage the pre amp section in manual mode and keep this setting the same as a reference point. Now, from here you can walk through each individual pedal one at a time. When you engage another pedal while your chosen pre amp setting is on and set, use either the gain knob, output knob or fx level knob to increase volume for that pedal section or decrease the volume for that pedal section. When setting your manual mode gain strucutre it's best to toggle between manual mode and one of your other modes, preset or user preset mode. Compare the volume levels and match manual mode as best as possible. Repeat this process for all pedal sections in manual mode. NOTE** your EQ pedal in manual mode will throw off the gain structure every time. So, the solution is to set the output level counter clock wise to no output gain. This allows your EQ settings to be applied to any combination of manual mode effects while retaining that gain structure. Lastly, any changes made to your manual mode effects settings may require a little more/less volumes in certain sections. Mostly in the dynamics based sections like pre amp, eq, compressor. The time based effect setting shouldn't be affected too much. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps.                
Ordered and delivered in fewer than 24 hours. Yet another plus for zZounds. So, I've read the reviews about the high gain drives sounding digital, and, well, since this IS a digital processor..... I'm not a high gain player, so that doesn't bother me. The overdrives (od-1, Tubescreamer, blues driver) sound great for me. My Bugera V22 brings this unit to life. Great match. I love my amp's natural overdrive,  but I was wanting more control over the levels on stage, so I thought I was going to need pedals. I've always loved Boss products, so I wanted to go that route, but a pedal board gets rather messy, and this multi effects unit cures those ills. This negates the need to purchase so many pedals. The modulation effects are stellar with this unit. The tuner is great, too. The expression pedal is a dream come true for me as well. I believe the sound is great through an amp and headphones. I can't wait to run it through the PA system at my church. The build quality is great as the casing is metal. The footswitches could give one a bit of concern, but I'm not heavy-footed.                 
I have owned several processors but fing scrolling through menus frustrating and slow. I hesitated to buy this device because although it seemed like it would be easier to use, i was concerned about limited functionality. Not a problem! I can create any tone i have needed quickly and easily. Very intiative. Great product!                
An amazing but complicated box. The only way to learn to operate this system is hands on training. once you get by that it becomes an easy tool to use and the effects are awesome with good sound and an amazing effects. I am satisfied in this item.                
I bought this here through zZounds with their magnificent Play As You Pay plan. The unit came in pretty quick and packaged extremely well. I plugged it up and starting jamming with it. The effects are pretty solid but the distortion is very thin and crackly. It would work if you play low distortion blues or rock but for metal it just did not cut it for me. in short, if you like wild effects and sparkly cleans this unit if for you, but if you like a modern metal tone i would go somewhere else.                
This is my first real effect pedal, so I don't know much, but what I do know is it's perfect for writing music. I can play anything from jazzy tunes to high gain metal. I wouldn't recommend it in a live setting unless you really get to understand it and set it up perfectly. I've owned it for a month and I'm still adjusting knobs trying to get the right sound, but that's because I'm a perfectionist. I love it though, it's better than any other multi effect pedal I've played with. It's easy to setup and get going right away. No digital menus to go through, so it's straight forward. All of the effects are pretty good, but some are a bit digital, but that's okay.                 
I really like the sound, tone and feel of this mufti-effects pedal. Manual mode allows pedal board style operation. The amp models are quite good. There are also many professional presets for download at Boss Tone Central.                 
I really like this pedal. i ultimately preferred the GT-100 because of the stereo options. That is the only reason. I think the octave effects are better on the me-80!                
Great effect!s My only issue with the ME-80 is the Overdrive/Distortion section which I use 80% of the time and Being with two different bands I can chose which Overdrive/Distortion I want.  But it was still too sterile sounding for me,maybe I'll wait a couple of years for the next revision. Other than that, its easy to use,easy to program,awesome effects,great Boss quality.  If you don't mind a slightly sterile Overdrive/Distortion then get it!  its a great deal! But as for me,I'll just wait a couple more years till Boss gets the OD/DS section figured out and I'm sure they will.  They have great Engineers and great minds that work over there.....                
The pedal is pretty awesome. Has a variety of uses. Only thing I feel that really pokes out to me, sound wise, is that the effects have a digital edge and I still get some noise in my fx loop even with the noise active and my ISP Decimator G STRING in the chain. The Terra echo is great and the ability to loop your riffs is awesome, definitely comes in handy. 
Wish there was better EQ on it but it's not too bad. Still that digital edgy sound if you're not careful.  
As for quality it's built great. All metal pretty much with some weight.                
I just recently sold my GT-100 because the sound was too thin (digital) and there were many digital artifacts when controlling effects parameters (stepping can be heard in every single instance when changing values via a controller) - I was hoping BOSS might have corrected some of these with the ME-80 - unfortunately, they haven't - it's very strange, but it seems the company has taken a "lowest denominator" approach to their new products - as though they figure most people won't be able to identify those issues.I was so disappointed in the sound and features (lack thereof) that I actually asked Zzounds for an RMA#, the very next day! Then, I had an idea: I connected my analog pedals to it for taking care of compression and ovedrive/distortion, and only use the ME-80 for other effects - that improved the sound and, even though I will have to carry some extra pedals, it's still easier than carrying my huge pedal boards for smaller gigs and/or rehearsal - so, I decided to keep it. Here are some things that BOSS could have done better, imo:1) have a switch for the speaker emulation as opposed to force you to plug something in, which is sure to cause problems in the long run. How expensive can a simple switch be?2) offer a few more effects, such as the SLICER, etc... and have more options for where those effects are located on the pedal board (which switch turns them on/off) as it is, I feel short changed for the amount of money the unit costs. Right now, the compression takes up the same slot as other effect and that is a waste. There should be a full-time compression "module" that can be switch on/off3) the AMP modelling is pretty weak - I don't even care if they actually emulate ANY amps, I just would like it to say good - this sounds very thing and digital - the DRIVE amp can be worked with and with the addition of an analog compressor it's workable3) again, the EQ section (not the the one in the AMP) should have its own, full time slot - instead, it now shares with other effects, such a Delay, CHR, etc..4) if you record a loop and then want to switch memory location (i.e. switch to a different patch), the loop is immediately erased - I don't know if this can be changed in the system options but, I don't recall seeing such a note in the manual.5) Why no effects loop? Really, at this price, there should be one.On the positive side the unit is a pleasure to use! Very easy and very intuitive - I hope they use this system on the next GT-100MKII or whatever they will call it - the knobs are just the ONLY way to go when creating patches! No more scrolling through screens/pages, etc... My wish list for the new replacement of the GT-100 is:1) an ANALOG section for COMPRESSION and DRIVE sounds2) An interface that uses the KNOBS for each section (as in the ME-80) 3) the new DOUBLE foot switches - those things rock!4) the MEMORY/MANUAL switch as in the ME-80 (please, no more having to press 2 switches at once, please!I used it at a gig last night, running stereo with a Boogie DC-3 and a TECH 21 PWR 60 cab and it sounded very good! It will NOT sound that good directly through a PA, even with the speaker emulation turned on, so be aware of that.All in all, it will make my life a bit easier and with a little ingenuity can be made to sound very good for most types of music. But, there will be compromises and some shortcomings to accept.                
Theres already plenty of reviews about this pedal but it does live up to its name. I love the distortion it delivers. I use a Marshall amp and a Gibson studio electric, put all three together it rocks!! I love it!                
I have had this about a month and am still working my way through all the possible combinations I can get out of it. It has good sound, good adjustments, easy to use, so far I love it!                 
I use a Washburnx37 seven string guitar with seymore duncan JB pickups and a Washburn 7 string with Dimarzio X2N pickups in the bridge.I drop way down to A and G tunings.With thick .70 strings.I use an old Ibanez Toneblaster 100 watt head for the clean channel and a presonus mic tube preamp to make the signal louder.With an Ibanez toneblaster 4x12 cab.Anyways This new boss metalcore pedal is crunchy and powerful at  the same time without being muddy or tinny.I like it alot better than the deathmetal pedal and the Metalzone.It also will make your sound more punchy.My band plays heavy,fast death and blackmetal and this pedal makes my sound cut through the mix with ease.I say to anyone with a cheap amp with crappy distortion to buy this pedal and run it into your clean channel for an awesome distortion tone.I would also buy a cheap 50.00$ tube preamp like a behringer or art ,just to boost your  guitar signal before it hits the amp.Makes it twice as loud!                
This pedal does not have  alot of features.It has a high,low,level and distortion adjustment.But its tuned for a heavy low mid crunchy sound.If you turn down the distortion and turn up the high then you will get a more midrange 80s metal lead sound.I like the highs down and lows up for a thick badass modern metal tone.Even if your guitar has cheap stock pickups,this thing will make um sound great.So go out and get a job and go buy this pedal.lol.                
easy                
Never had to contact Boss.                
BY far the best overall sound for METALHEADS. after some careful decision making between this and 2 other pedals (one by line 6 and other by Digitech) i am more than happy with the sound. I use this with a stock LTD f50 and a crate GTX212 120 watt and the range of sound is incredible. Metal to black metal and death metal and everything in between!                
i jumped on the free Ac adapter offer!!!                 
EASY EASY EASY is all i have to say. after playing around with teh settings, i found my favorite sound in just a few minutes                
It seems tough. time will tell.                 
Definitely worth the price in its range.                 
could be bigger.. haha but its sexy.                 
Myself,I play a Fender 60's Classic Strat, I've tried alot of Boss' Pedals, Each one gives at lest some unique sound of it's own, But as far as the ML-2 Metal Core goes, I commonly dial In low in the pedal and low in the amp to get that really deep sound.. It doesnt fuzz out, It's a nice smooth tone, It even does beautiful work with my Fender Frontman 15B amp.. to anyone who wants an Industrial or Hardcore metal sound.. Its A MUST!!                
I have no complaints what so ever, Really I'm happy that they didnt produce it in Digital, I prefer the classic analog.. Though I kinda wish It had memory settings of a Digital, Cause I find a good setting.. and I forget exactly what it was when I try to go back to it.                
It's almost too easy!                 
Well, It comes with a five year warranty from Boss, I've literally abused it.. stomped into it during a good fun riff, I've accidently kicked it in the middle of the night, forgetting I left it in the floor, even when I put a new battery in it today, It slipped out of my hand and I dropped it.. didnt affect it even in the least bit.  It's awesome!                
Im really happy with it, It's worth whatever price tags anyone puts on em , probably even more.                
I love the way it looks, an original design.. I love the black and silver-flake paint scheme, looks great and adds a certain finesse to my  three-tone sunburst Fender Strat and my jet-black with silver-screening Fender amps..                
Only way I'll look for another distortion pedal, if Boss builts another ML series with added features, or maybe combine It with a reverb pedal?.. Either way I'll always enjoy the ML-2.                
I have to say, I was sceptical and excited about this pedal. I own the MT-2 and have for a couple years, I have also tried numerous other pedals.  This one, out of the box, kicks ass.  Easy to manipulate tone (unlike the nasaly MT-2), serious bottom end and screaming highs.  I have fallen in love with a pedal again!  It was a long time coming, but it's definately worth the wait!  Get one and try it out, if you don't like it return it, but I doubt you will!                
This is the heaviest pedal ever made!  I have the Metal Zone and I like it, but if you play it side by side with the Metal Core, it will sound weak and watery.  The Core has the deep down and dirty tone that makes for serious edgy metal.  It is DEEP!  It will give that heavy tone that you really need if you drop tune.  If you don't drop, you will sound like you do.  It's that heavy.  Buy one.  Buy three.  It's that good.                
You can contour the tone very well.  You can give it lots of highs, or dial 'em back and just go for heavy rhythm chunk.  And let me tell you, it will give you CHUNK!                
Very easy standard controls, just like any other Boss or any other pedal, but with tone for days.                
Like all Boss, it is built like a tank, very road-worthy.  I have more than a dozen Boss pedals and in 4 years I have never had a Boss pedal break.                
The best tone you will get from any pedal.  Forget the price.  It will replace a few pedals on your board.  In fact, you may want this as the ONLY pedal on your board.                
Boss rules, simple as that.                
Nice color.  Cool metal gray.                
I said "Buy it!" and I meant it! Now quit screwing around and go get one!  Are you still reading this...                   
Well I must say I am disappointed in this pedals sound. Very grainy and sctratchy with lots or high gain. Does not do good lows with drop tuning.                
First let me say I bought this pedal looking for a good Metal Distortion pedal. I play a mixture of Death Metal, Grindcore and Speed Metal and I was looking for a pedal that would compliment my styles. I had heard a lot of great things about this pedal from many people so I went out on a limb and bought it. Unfortunately for me, that limb couldn't hold my weight. Or at least not the weight of my sound demands. I gave it a ten on features because It's got good features. But the sound and texture doesn't change much.                
Ease of use it pretty straight forward. I mean you'd have to be a complete idiot not to know how to use it. There is one problem though is that you really have to screw with the knobs if you want to lower your gain at all. It really throws off the EQ.                
It's made well.                  
it's hard to decide. It's a fair price for a pedal like it but not for the sound that comes from it. I'd pay more for a crap complementary pedal than this, but thats because I hate the sound. All in all if you like it sure. If you don't then no value sucks.                
It's a pedal... It doesn't even sound sexy                
I would recommend not getting this pedal if you are a fan of modern heavy metal. If you must then fine, but I would strongly encourage getting the Digitech Metal Master of Boss MT-2 Metal Zone.                
I like the sound of this pedal. Turn up the lows for a heavy, dirty sound perfect for nu metal, death metal, and the like. Crank up the highs, and youll get a nice ,trebly scream oh so useful for those nice 80s leads. But comparing it to the MT-2 is pretty stupid (Sorry if younr sick of the MT-2 comparisons). I think that the MT-2 is the best distortion stompbox ever, and maybe a top five stompbox ever, period. So dont even try to compare them.                
This is probably the low point for this pedal. Its about average in features comparing to other stompboxes, maybe a little below that. There are four knobs: Low, High, Level, Gain. But the Mid knob is missing, which is HUGE, because that means NO SCOOPING and NO MID-BOOSTED SOLO SOUNDS! And compared to the MT-2, its just shameful.                
As I said earlier, there is kind of a lack of features on this pedal. But that makes up here. Its REALLY easy to use. For the idiot, heres how: you turn the knobs until you get the sound you want, then you just play. Easy, huh? Its easier to use than the MT-2, but I know how to operate stompboxes, so this isnt an issue.                 
Its a Boss. Enough said.                
Its $99.00 for this thing, when you can get the MT-2 for the same price. Take your pick.                
I dont know, so Ill give it a neutral rating.                
Ill hand it to Boss here: they made a NICE looker here. The black and silver is DEFINATELY good for heavy metal. Not the best looking stomper ever, but one of the best-looking stomper Boss makes.                
Its a pretty good pedal. its got a nice lowdown, dirty sound for modern metal. But really, if you want this pedal THAT bad, do yourself favor and get the best distortion stomper ever in the MT-2 Metal Zone. Trust me, you wont regret it.                
The sound is AMAZING!! It's more distortion then you'll probably ever need. I would recommend this pedal to anyone that plays rock, thrash or metal etc. I've found the sound I craved for.                
Just your simple level,low, high and distortion knobs. The sparkles all over the pedal make it look outstanding!                
Simple to operate. Manual is also very clear about it.                
This pedal was made with incredible craftsmanship. It will easily last 10 years.                
Great pedal for a great price. I would gladly pay more then the retailed price.                
This pedal is a must have. Looks and plays great. Buy it NOW!                
This pedal sounds SICK!!! It sounds like a wall of high gain amps yet it comes in such a small easy to use package. I play everything from Classic Rock to Death Metal and this pedal dose it all easily.                
This pedal is so easy to use. It has only 4 knobs: volume, low, high, and gain. You can easily dial in sounds. A child could find Metallica's tone in less than 15 seconds!                
I could literally toss this pedal off my two story house and it would probably only get louder! It's a BOSS what more can I say?                
The Metal Core should be priced a lot more than it is. I bought mine new for $99.99 and that's a steal.                
I will never neet an other pedal again for metal.                
The sound is sick. This pedal can be used for just about any style of rock and metal. From smoth overdrive to insane rediculous distortion this pedal can do it. It is by far the best sounding distortion pedal on the market.                
The best.                
Most pedals today have a bunch of anoying knobs that can confuse many players, but BOSS takes away the problemb with 4 simple dials.
Volume, Low, High, Distortion.                
I can literally through this pedal off my house without it breaking.                
This product is worth twice what I paied for it which was about $110.                
All my friends who used it want it.                
What more is there to say?                
This pedal is an amazing high gain pedal that delivers that earth shuttering ferocious distortion that us metal heads have been looking for. It is most compatible with nu metal, death metal, metalcore, most types of metal. It just sounds amazing, I run it through a Peavey 6505 plus head. All I have to say is oh my god. Its really sharp and has lows that will shake the ground and knock down paintings. Hell ya!                
4 knobs is all it needs. You got the low adjusts and everything.                
Its a pedal.                
Looks great, black metal look, very sleek finish.                
Pretty cheap, for a edal of its sound. I'd buy it anyday.                
Haven't need to use it, I'll put 10 as a default.                
Although I'm not sexually interested in pedals, I have to say, this pedal looks like a beast.                
It is great. You can make a nice rythym sound when you scoop out some highs, turn up the lows, and it sounds so good. Vice-Versa for a lead tone. The distortion is great. I wasnt gidding the distortion on my Traynor YCV-40, it has as much distortion as metal core when it is turned up a little. The sound is so great because, it s so distorted but single notes are clear, but stll ferocoious. great sound. It doesnt have that fuzz that just makes you sound like mud.                
Just the distortion. But that deserves a ten by itself.                
Extremely easy, turn it on and melt some faces.                
Nice metal. It is durable as all Boss products. It's great.                
Its worth it for anyone who plays anything from Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, to Cradle of Flth to Ozzy.                
the only problem is that the patch cords come out when you accidently step on them. I havent reached them.                
its beatiful. it sparkles and is eye catching.                
GET IT!!!!! It kicks ass!!!!!                
The sound is amazing. It is a really heavy pedal and thats what i like about it. If you like to drop tune to C or B like me, then this is the pedal for you. It can give lots of chunky, over the top sound. There's some feedback but that's not a problem. My amp has pretty good distortion on it for playing pantera and stuff, but this pedal multiplies it by 5. Its SO HEAVY!!                
You can change the tone really easily. If you want a really heavy rythm tone, turn up the lows and distortion and dial back the highs. If you want a lead town with lots of sustain, crank up the highs.                
level, low, high, dist knobs. How much easier can it get?                
This thing is a BEAST!!! Its small but it kills. It will survive the next three nuclear wars. Maybe not, but you know what i mean.                
I'd pay 200 for this pedal.                
only problems ive had are with the patch cords staying in.                
I was a little nervous about getting this pedal cause i didn't know if it would match up to the distortion on my amp. Now that i have it, i like it more than my guitar.                
Two words: GET IT!!!!!!!!!!                
Lets see, you get:
112 effect types
3 loops for you own pedals
a tuner
MIDI control (out)
I use mine with my EVH 5150 III 50 watt head, so my patches also control channel switching. This pedal is actually smaller than the amps footswitch. Also I use a DigiTech Drop pedal, it's a bit better than the built in pitch shift in the MS-3.
It's got everything I need, the acoustic simulator cleans up the amp even cleaner than it is by default. Also with the patches you can adjust to equalize the volume disparity between channel 1 and 2.
first off i had been looking for a new pedal. i browsed about 50, give or take, pedals reviewing sound and quality of each one. then i came across the metal zone and loved it. luckly i got mine from a pawn shop. the lady said "i've got one distortion pedal thing" i thought great a $20 pedal. but to my supprise she put the metal zone up on the counter for $50 and i traded her for my marshall 10 watt practice amp (bought at $80). sound is awesome. the quality is awesome. its very responsive effect pedal, whether your chugging strings open or palm muting. this is def. a pedal for rock and metal genres. overall tone is unbelievable. the diversity in this pedal is amazing. if you want a soft to hardcore sound. i would encourage you to purchase the metal zone. with that said if you're looking for black metal type sound might want to check out Boss Metal Core pedal.                 
its sucks that you dont get a power cable with the pedal, but, its not an inconvience. 9v battery life is long. only applies battery power when cables are plugged in "like active pickups in guitars" Boss also provides power cables for sale and have pedal power boards for this product. its got a solid frame and a sturdy spring under the switch so you dont have that accidental off flip while playing. once you stomp that badboy it doesn't let you down even if battery power is low. play it enough you'll find from your own experiance that this is a great petal for any guitar players gear.                
its easy, just turn the knobs until you feel the tingle in your fingers wanting to play. straight forward controls, i play a modular ibanez half stack with the metal zone atm, next to a peavey 5150 tube amp. of my friend. i can honestly say you can tell the metal zone has a "generated sound" compared to a 5150, but, it doesnt stand out. overall the ibanez amp with the metal zone can and does generate the sound of a tube amp and does a great job doing it. keep that in mind for all those on a budget.                  
look at the pictures its cool and will last quiet a few shows. you might say $100 pedal or a $10 pedal. you get what you pay for. metal zone price may seem high, but, you may need to come down off you possible high if you go pay $10 for a pedal that will last one show, if that. the box frame helps ensure that the pedal doesn't start to warp over time. rounded pedals with plastic buttons will start wearing out before this one does.                 
its the bang for your buck.                
you dont need the support. these pedals were meant for one thing PLAYING. if you have to talk to support at anytime, then the product sucks and you should look else where. Boss support would be a dream job, setting and waiting for a phone that doesn't ring playing solitare on the computer instead of Boss Manufacturing Technical Support Catalog Software. Sweet. O.o                
it can be tough out there as a musician sometimes things that you need just are not in the budget. this pedal is a investment in my opinion. standard piece of equipment every guitarist should have. if you have active pickups, get a Boss Noise Suppressor pedal with the Boss Metal Zone to help cancel the static of your active pickups. im not going to go put a comment on the Boss NS pedal, its a must too for active pickups.                 
Boss is a great company to look at go research their products and decide for yourself if their worth your time. dont let reviews pursuade you to go buy products. thats how you find expensive garbage. its the companies job to sell them. search for audio and video displaying the product. what is the company doing to ensure your satisfaction? 
hope you enjoyed the review                
The MT2 allows the user to achieve distortion sounds from today's rock music to the Heavy Metal sounds of yesterday's rock.                 
The duel control knobs make it very easy for the fine tuning of your desired sound.                
Boss pedals are all set to a great height and angle for a natural yet solid foot motion.                
Built to last a lifetime.                 
This pedal originally sold for as much as $179.00 that was a little steep. Now the pedal is really a great bargain.                   
The boss support team is very knowledgeable about their products and are very helpful. I needed a part for one of my pedals before and they got it to me very quick. The only thing I did not like about boss is they way over charged me on the parts and shipping. If it wasn't for that they would have gotten a 10.                  
This thing is at the head of my effects chain and I just couldn't imagine ever having a different distortion. I've tried many distortions and found this one to be the absolute best.                 
If I ever had to replace the Metal Zone distortion pedal (because I fried it or something.)I would in a heartbeat. It can make just about any guitar setup sound like your playing from an overdriven Marshall stack. Also, this pedal changes with my musical tastes. As I get older I find that I'm turning the amount of distortion used down a little. But, When I really wanna shred. I turn it up and "BAM" I'm 19 again. Overall it's a great pedal.                 
I ordered this because i would'nt have my half stack in time for a show. So i was just going to run the pedal to a direct box into the p.a. and settle for whatever it gave me. so i tried it out on just my surround sound and my electric had no strings. so i plugged my acoustic electric (takamine) into the pedal and WOW i was impressed. it has a wide range of sound. the low was nice and punchy and very tight. mids were amazing as well. the highs kinda fizzled out but i believe thats due to my acoustic not really the pedal. great job and i recommened this for anyone playing august burns red, bvb, periphery, etc..                
It's pretty hard giving this monster less than 10 on sound since you can get ANY tone with it, so whatever sound sounds like 10 on 10 for you, it can do it :) I was going to get a new amp but I bought this instead and I get killer tones with even my cheap 15w Peavey Rage 158.                
Well it's got more than any other single effect I've ever seen, and the parametric mids really make it stand out. The rubber pad underneath and on the footswitch make it very difficult to slip around and the recessed knobs prevent accidental tone adjustments. Really, what more can you ask?                
First off, the manual kind of sucked, but apart from that, this pedal is really easy to use. I just spent an hour or so playing around with the settings and now I can quickly get pretty much any sound I want.                
Just from the look of it, you can tell this thing is built to last a long time. Nothing to complain about for sound quality though.                
Well 100$ might seem pretty steep but keep in mind that you can get much more tones out of this that most other effect pedals so I think it's worth it. I tried it 10 minutes at the guitar shop and it's all it took me to be convinced.                
Didn't have to deal with them, but I shouldn't have to.                
The design is very simple, yet appealing. Orange text on black steel always looks nice :) I mean come on, just look at it, it's fricking sexy.                
I don't think I'm ever going to get rid of this wonderful pedal. Even if I someday get a great quality full stack I think this will still be a nice addition to my setup. It improved my tone by a factor of about 69000, give or take a few thousands. I tried my friend's digitech Hot Head and I like the MT2 much better.                
Amazing. Absolutely AMAZING. 10s are rare for me, but this pedal deserves it... BIG TIME. You can get ANY sound out of it, from thrash-scoops to mid-boosted solos to screaming 80's firepower to dirty nu metal rumble. And thats with the gain knob cranked to the max. Vary it around, and you get a nice, bluesy drive; a crunch, or WHATEVER. Blues players, overdrivers, dont be fooled by the name. This pedal can do it ALL, and it sounds good, too.                
For a stomper, this thing has a wide variety of features. Theres the gain knob (which the DigiTech Death Metal lacks, still a good pedal), the low, high, and mid knobs (the latter isnt on the average ML-2 Metal Core), the standard Level knob (name a distortion stomper without a level knob), and the Mid Freq knob (my personal favorite). The gain knob controls the gain. The level knob controls the volume. The low, mid, and high knobs control the low, mid, and high frequencies, respectively, and the mid freq shapes the mid to make it cutting-edge treble to warm, rumbling bass. All thats missing is a prescence knob, but thats all right. This pedal is jam-packed w/ features enough.                
W/ all of the knobs, it might be confusing for a beginner. But I know how to work these pedals, so that doesnt affect me.                
One word: Boss.                
If youre on a budget, then the DigiTech Death Metal is your pedal. After all, this pedal is twice as much as the DigiTech. But $99 for the best distortion stomper is a pretty good deal in my mind. $99 might be a bit expensive, but its worth every penny.                
I dont know, so Ill give it a 5 by default.                
It looks pretty good (who knew orange on black worked so well), but if your REALLY looking for the chicks, get the Boss Blues Driver or the DigiTech Death Metal.                
When I give a pedal a 9 overall (more like a 9.5 boardering 10) you KNOW that pedal is good. But calling this pedal good is an understatement. Calling it the best distortion stompbox EVER is more like it. For $99, you cant go wrong with it. Bottom Line: This pedal is legendary for a good reason.                
The sound is amazing.  I have several other distortion pedals, and for Metal/Hard Rock...this is the king.  It adds the distortion you want, but doesnt muddy  it up.  Some of the other pedals I have do not keep the tonal clarity of the Boss.                
I love the complete tonal variance of the built-in EQ.  Unlike other pedals that just have "tone" this pedal allows you to sculpt the tone how you want...                
This was not my first MT-2....so I knew how to set it up in seconds.  I have had it for 3 weeks this time, and I am still adjusting the EQ to get more and more tones.  I keep a book of settings and sound shapes so that if I want to go back and recreate one....I can easily.                
I dont know about this pedal....but my TU-2 tuner pedal is 10+ years old....and my Harmonist is even older, all working perfectly. The paint is durable and will take years of abuse.                
You can't beat this pedal.  It is what it is....a Hard Rock/Medal pedal that does allow for tone shaping to get just what yuou want.  With all the posibilities, I might have to get another one with different sound maps.                
I have never had to contact them, never had a problem with one of their products.                
This pedal does what it says, delivers Metal sound, with no fuss.  You can set it up quickly with a nice mid scoop, dial the gain up, and shred the night away.....Or, you can custom tailor you tone with built-in EQ.  This is not just another Tone + or - setup, but you can customize your sound to your taste.
This is the one pedal that will keep you coming back.  It did with me.  This is my second one...and I wonder why I ever stopped using it.  It is too versitile to jsut toss away.                
I've been trying to build a pedal board, started about a month ago with the Hardwire TL2 Metal Distortion.  It sounded ok, but wasn't close to what I was looking for.  Got this Boss MT2 Metal Zone Distortion pedal for Christmas, and I will say that it has really great all around sound, mids, lows, highs, it's all there.  I am selling the Hardwire pedal now because I will never use it.  I couldn't be happier with this Boss pedal, you can change the tones, distortion, volume gets loud if you want it to.  Overall, this pedal gives me all the sound I have been looking for with a lower priced distortion pedal.  You won't regret buying one.  The digitech pedal sounds very dull compared to this pedal.  I like the Boss SO MUCH MORE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
From the squeal of the upper frets to the raging boom of Drop-D tuning, this lil' bastard can do it all                
Built in mid range frequency adjustment allows you to go from a thin, squealy Metallica-esque trebley sound to a broad, thick "Ozzy Osbourne - Crazy Train"-esque sound.                
Built like a bomb shelter, I bet if a tornado picked this thing up and threw it into the ocean and 50 years later some divers found it and returned it to me, it would still work                
Great value, this thing is awesome, no doubt about it                
Its Boss, so I assume they have great support, but I haven't talked to them                
First pedal I ever bought, last pedal I'd ever sell                
Perfect for any kind of hard rock, and if you've got guts, jazz and blues as well                
It gives you so much control that you can go from light dirty clean to metal. It would be nice if they had put a octave switch in it but no complaints. one of the best pedals I have ewver owned.                
The most useful thing that I found on this pedal is the control of the amount of distortion that you want and the tone adjustments.                
There is now way to ruin this pedal it wil take a beaten but will still work like new.                
The price may seem a little high but when you get it you say to your self that you'll never regret paying that price.                
I have never had a problem so I have never had to deal with the company but have dealt with a lot of their products and love them all.                
The looks are great the pedal just looks so awsome that it one that makes the pedal rack lokk even better than it did.                
Overall this is the best pedal I own thats over a Korg A5.
Great product for the price.                
This little box by Boss has a great tone.  I have listened to many distortion effects over the years, but this effect  is just what I have wanted. I am very happy with it.  I did not buy the Boss power cable, but purchased a different manufactures and hooked it thru a daisey chain.    No problems/Very happy !                
The sound is awsome ,, ofcourse depending what you play. i play Alot of Metallica! and heavy stuff, it plays less heavy pretty well,,ppl that diss the sound.. pls learn how to used it first                
nice equalizer man, sound goes great with my effects gear                
well took me awile to use it, i got it second hand, when i got the hang of the equalizer,, this thing rocked,,                 
small pedal but undestructable!! do i need to say more,, i had this pedal for awile and if it can stand my beating,,i can approve this pedal to anyone                
top noch value for me,, i paid 60 bucks canadian for it,, it buy far my favorite pedal                
second hand, no support                
its a tank,, need i say more                
well i have this pedal for awile and its still awsome,, if it quits on me i'll go buy another one,,i wanted this thing as soon as i saw it,,like i said it goes great with my fx..its a good hard rock to heavy sound,,it made my crappy 5w sound good! i'm on a 30 w now,, theres no comparing                
The sound is great, you can go from thick metal or thrash (my favorite), to overdrive and blues/rock.  If your amp has weak distortion on it (like mine (Behringer GMX1200H), this pedal will take care of it.                
I love the 4 band EQ, it's got great bottem end and thrashing highs.  The distortion has a nice tone too.                
It's a BOSS, built like a tank.                
Worth the price by far.                
Haven't had to deal with them.                
It's very sexy.                
My amp head's distortion was very crunchy and not as powerful as I wanted it to be, and I heard/read about this pedal, so I decided to try it out and after I did I bought it immediatly.  It has such a great tone for metal, thrash, blues, rock, just use the 4 band EQ and scope out your sound, I garentee you'll find it.                
The most versatile distortion I've ever heard. From long, singing sustain, to harsh edgy rock and metal, it does it all !                
Very easy to use controls and easy access battery compartment.                
Built like a tank !                
After trying about 20 different distortion pedals including Fulltone, this pedal is the freaking BEST !                
Great customer support service online.                
Nice looking and sounds superb !                
I will have this forever. I have been searching for *this* type of sound for many years.                
i got mine used and its in perfect condition still, the whole thing barely has a scratch. it owns                
yes it is.                
it looks so cool, and plays so damn well, how could u not get one?                
i think the only reason i would have for buying a new effect would be if i wanted to experiment with different sounds and effects, this one pedal does the job so far, the reason i bought this pedal was because my guitarist friend had one and another boss and i played with both and chose this one, it was the perfect sound. i love how easy everything is about it, i dont have anything bad to say about it, for now.............                
Play with it long enough and you can get plenty of different tones. It added sustain, quite nice for my cheap bolt-on ibanez. However, the overall sound quality is what I would refer to as 'tinny'... course you can't expect a big tube amp in a pedal, and maybe I'll tune that out in time... but if your ears are keen you'll know it's digital, imo. And if you're a basement jammer like me, that doesn't matter too much, the boost this gives over my little Peavy "Rage" 158's distortion is great. Finally, I'd like to say the mechanical quality is up there with heavy weaponry (tanks), and if I can swing it, I'll be looking for their overdrive and perhaps noise silencer pedals sooner or later.                
Sound is awesome. excellent for any kind of metal and quite good for other genres such as rock. You can get a variety of sounds with the EQ. But of course, its most suited to metal, therefore you might not be able to get the perfect sound for other genres.                
The EQ is awesome and gives you lots of variety. It has pretty much everything a distortion pedal should need.                
Its very well made, like all BOSS products. metal casing, virtually bomb proof. I wouldn't be surprised if it still worked after you threw it off the top of a tall building.                
Awesome value. Heaps of bang for your buck.                
Have never dealt with them.                
Looks awesome. a metallic black color. looks mean and nasty.                 
This is, in my opinion, the best distortion pedal you can buy. Especially if your into metal. Great for that metallica sound.                 
This is the best sounding pedal out without a doubt in my mind                
could be a little cheaper, but you forget about the price once you play with it                
covered for 5 years                
This made my $250 fender champ 300 amp sound like my friends $1200 crate halfstack amp.  A must buy if you are into any type of metal or hard rock, from metallica to unearth. Stop thinking about it and go but it!                
what can i say.its a versatile distortion pedal.from 70`s rock to heavy metal.trust me,you`re gonna love this pedal.                
with its 3 band EQ,you can create any tone that you desire.                
its a boss pedal.its like a tank!                
this pedal takes 3 months for me to own it.thank god,its worth of every penny.                
Must get it!                
The Dist of it is PERFECT for metal.
i get a very unique sound out of it, is close to 
dino cazares sound in Fear Factory Obsolete                
It a very good Equalizer and distortion to break your amp                
Is not for noobs. it has a wide range of tones                
Is a tank, imposible to break                
it worth te money                
never used it                
the color is black with orange letters
perfect for metal                
The metal dist EVER!                
this is very cool i can get screaming distortion that comes with hours of sustain                
very high quality pedal for anyone playing metal                
this is the highest quality pedal i own it will probabaly outlast me.                
this is worthit so buy it now!                
Wow. THIS is the metal sound. THIS is metal. And it sounds SICK. Flat-Out SICK. I used it in conjunction with a noise gate, EQ, and compressor, and let me tell you, this thing kicks a$$... big time. Its a LOT better than the Metalcore pedal, and a lot, LOT better than the DS-1 I own. Also, its more inspiring than the Danelectro FAB Metal I own. This is probably the best hi-gain pedal I've heard.                
Its a pedal. Whats to expect? Well, it has more features than most.                
With more features than the average pedal, its harder to use. But still. Its a pedal. Just stomp and play.                
One word:Boss.                
Sorry, but $99 is pricey for this pedal.                
This is by default. Havent used it.                
Its a pedal, but its fricking BLACK!                 
Its Boss. Its a pedal. Its a Boss Pedal. Its a metal pedal. Its a Boss metal pedal, and its the best metal pedal Ive ever heard! If youre still reading and considering whether to get it, youre an IDIOT! Just take that cash and BUY IT!                
The sound it great.  Great quality. One of this pedals strong points.                
It is simple but has everything you need.  If you play around with the knobs you'll find a sound you like.  But you need the power adapter, which is why I gave this an 8.  The batteries only last about 20 minutes.                
Really easy to figure out.  And the manual shows you how to get different sounds.                
Solid metal construction.                  
Pretty expensive... but definitely worth it.                
Have never needed it.                
Looks great                
The only distortion pedal you will ever need.  Has everything from slight overdrive for Pink Floyd solos, to Heavy distortion for isanely dark metal riffs.                
great sounding anything from hard rock to heavy metal                
built to last                
could be cheaper                
5 year warranty is pretty good                
it has awesome looks                
great pedal u need to go out and get it                
I actually have TWO of these, one is a "newer" 1998 black label model that I got used off eBay. The other one I've had for at least twenty seven years now and have never had any problems with it, I got the old one used off my best friend in hardly ever used, mint condition, he didn't ever use it, need it or want it, he went with a computerized midi rack system back in the late 80's and was selling off all his old analog stuff, it's an old green label model and it has held up fine and still looks new. I find it hard to get the equalization exactly where I want it on either model though! I either get too much low-end, not enough, too much mid-range or not enough, or way too much treble! I wish either one gave a little more punch and crunch but they DO sound much better than MANY dozens of Distortion pedals that I own or have tried, disliked and sold off! I have considered getting one or both of these modded but have not yet done so! I have tried or used them both through many Tube and Solid state amps, tiny practice amps, etc., and find the sound roughly the same from both pedals, except that the older one might give a little dirtier sound at a high gain than the newer one.                
this pedal is amazing! so much distortion, more than you'll know what to do with. ive played it lots of times and loved every second of it! the 3 band eq is great..lots of sound options.                 
the 3 band eq says it all... ~                
IT'S SO EASY... A CAVEMAN COULD DO IT.                
mind-boggling...you can drop it and wont hurt it a bit...
maybe a paint chip here or there. :P                
yea...100 bucks.. alot of money but its really worth it.
the wide variety of sounds and so much gain for metal/ death metal/hardcore...                
um...great..i guess...ha...but yea awesome                
i was going to get it 2weeks ago but i got the boss dd-6 digital delay...i could decide on whice one but the METAL ZONE IS NEXT ON MY LIST...A.S.A.P !!!!!,..... i need it                
JUST SIMPLY AMAZING                
Adjustable to any kinda music you like to play: From the hounds of hell to Elvis through an old fifties radio....
Get's a bit blurry with high amounds of treble and middle                 
It's Boss. Always good products, though not my favorite.                
Still Boss.                
It rocks..                
I've purchased 2 of these. I get the sound I want from the pedal and it can take a beating except for the input jacks on the pedal. I've had the input jacks on the pedal give out on me on both the pedals. I have to frequently jiggle the pedal in order for the feedback to quit. Sometimes feedback is very loud and sometimes quiet. Other times whenever there is no feed back it often acts as though I have turned the volume from the pedal very low. I have tested my cables and guitar jack all separately using the same half stack and have never seen any of the symptoms appear.                
I really like the sound of this pedal. I can find pretty much every setup for the kind of musik i like (Metallica, Iron Maiden, Jimi Hendrix and so...)
Today i tried to make fuzz setup, and i really couldn't get it sound the way I wanted it. Then i cut of the tone of the brigde pickup, and then i had the more Jimi Hendrix old 70's fuzz sound. Amazing!                
I have to this pedal has a great range of tones, because of the extra equalizers on it. The one I find best, is the middle/frequence-sound. Jesus it can really create the tone you want!                
At first I  have to say it is pretty hard to get the right sound, but that's also it. You will have to tweak the knobs many times, but if the musik you like is in the category of metal/rock and so, you will find it!                
I have bought three different BOSS pedals, and neither one of them has ever cost me any trouble. I think it is almost impossible to destroy this pedal! It is A TANK!                
This pedal is all worth it. I could not see how it shouldn't have this price. You can use this pedal for so many different bands, and it truly delivers the tone I want!                
I don't know, because I haven't had a single problem with any of my BOSS pedals!                
I like everything this pedal. The color, te way it's built, it's a part of my music!                
I will definately keep using this product, because it fits so good into the kind of my music. I do not like the extremely heavy, death kind of metal, but then; I don't even have to play that. I can make it sound like I want! NICE!                
Awesome                
The Best                
This pedal is durable.                
Yes this product is the best.                
The pedal is flawless.                
It's badass!                
This pedal is very versible and durable.                
I PICKED UP THIS PRODUCT LAST WEEK. I HAVE A FENDER STRATOCASTER AND IT MAKES IT SOUND AMAZING. WITH BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU WANT YOUR PEDAL TO OPERATE IT IS COOL. I HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH THIS PRODUCT.                
IT DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY ACCESSORIES, BUT THIS EFFECTS PEDAL IS SOMETHING THAT TOPS ALL THE OTHER BRANDS IN GUITAR EFFECTS FOR METAL. THE MOST USEFUL FEATURES ARE NOT HAVING TO ADJUST IT THAT MUCH IT IS READY TO JAM WITH EVERYTIME. I WISH IT CAME WITH A CABLE TO CONNECT OTHER EFFECTS PEDALS. THIS IS MY FIRST GUITAR EFFECTS PEDAL AND I PLUGGED IT IN TO MY FENDER AND MY LITTLE CRATE AMP AND IT IS AMAZING THE SOUNDS THAT CAN COME OUT OF THAT THING FOR NOT BEING A 200 OR 300 DOLLAR AMP.                
I THINK THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD HURT THIS PEDAL IS IF YOU DROPPED IT IN A SWIMMING POOL, OR THROW IT AGINST THE WALL. THIS ITEM IS WELL BUILT AND I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING BREAKING MY FRIEND HAD A METAL MASTER OR SOMETHING MADE BY DIGITECH AND IT WAS A PIECE OF CRAP.                
YOU KNOW YOU CANT GO OUT AND GET A PAUL REED SMITH FOR $500 YOU GOT TO PAY THE PRICE AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE PRICE'S THAT BOSS HAS                 
I HAVEN'T HAD TO CALL THEM OR ANYTHING CAUSE "BOSS" MAKES THE BEST EFFECTS I BELIEVE AND IF I DID WRITE THEM IT WOULD BE A COMPLIMENT LETTER SAYING THANK YOU FOR ALL THE COOL STUFF YOU MAKE FOR GUITARS.                 
THIS PRODUCT HAS JUST THE RIGHT TOUCH TO ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF                
It has so many different sounds you can get with, it is just amazing.  I had no idea that there was that many different sounds of distortion.                
The 2 middle knobs have knobs around them, which I enver saw before.                
I own other Boss pedals and they dont have any problems with durability.                
It is a little bit pricey, but after playing it for the first time you wont even care that you spent 100 bucks for it.                
Boss are and always will be on of the best pedals.                
I like the MXR pedals look the best, so if this pedals looked like that I would pay about 200, but this one is pretty dull, but again its worth it for the sound you get out of it.                
With all the possibilities on this thing I dont think I could ever get bored of it.                
It sounds awesome. Way better than all the other pedals I've ever played with. There are so many different sounds you can get from this thing.                
The dist knob is really cool. I love how you can go from a nice bluesy tone to a huge heavy metal sound.                
Ease of use? Umm... you turn the knobs until you get the sound you want. How hard could it really be?                
Metal pedal made of metal. The only problem I have ever had with it was actually my fault. I didn't screw the thumb screw all the way in and it popped open once. I like the rubber on the bottom and top.                
Yeah, I know. $100. But... it's worth it. I would buy it again if I somehow went back in time. It's highly unlikely, but I would. I got what I payed for and then some.                
No experience yet, and I never plan on it.                
I don't know how I have lived without this thing for so long. Five minutes in Guitar Center and I was hooked. I dreamed about it for months before finaly getting it. It looks cool too. Boss pedals all seem to look way cooler than any others. Plus, you can play almost anything through it. White Stripes? done. System of a Down? done. Nirvana? done. The Pink Panther Theme song? done. Hawaii 5-0? done. Rise Against? Weezer? Ramones? AC/DC? done. I even play Miley Cyrus' "Party In The USA" with a droptuned guitar. It makes people laugh. Also, I love the song.                
This is my first pedal, and I am extremely happy with it. I'm not the best guitarist in the world by far. I'm still learning. But I sound awesome when I play "State of the Union" by Rise Against, or "According To You" by Orianthi through this pedal. I love to play so much more now. And I started writing songs again. I was never really much into heavy metal. I love System of a Down and can play some of their songs though, and they sound so cool now. Oh yeah, I got the power cord thing for it. Which was a good idea cuz I ran the battery down pretty fast. But then again, I played it all day at high volume. Anyway, you should get it because batteries are retardedly expensive. If you are considering it, just buy it. If you are not considering it, you should be. If you have it already, good for you. Wether you play heavy metal or not, you'll like this pedal.                
This is, hands down, the best distortion pedal to ever hit the musician market.  This pedal really is everything you really need in terms of distortion.  I would really not have it any other way.  I used to use a BOSS DS-1 Distortion, but after hearing the MT-2, I moved onto it, as my tastes in death/brutal metal increased.  I sold off my DS-1 for it was nothing compared to the Metal Zone.  Not only is the distortion much better, but you can make the Metal Zone into a wussy overdrive if you wanted to.  So it really suits any need, although the name would probably turn off most prog/punk/pop rock musicians.  However, this thing makes even a crappy amp sound pretty powerful.  I liked the DS-1, but the MT-2 is much much better.  You're actually better off paying more for the MT-2.  The soud quality is just uncomparable.                
I really like how it had much more than the Metal Core pedal in terms of EQ, and unlike the DS-1, it actually had an EQ.  What's so lovely about the MT-2, is that it has 4 customizable bands.  The high, low, mid, and mid freq.  My personal favorite is the mid freq, for it really defines everything, and makes the distortion sharp (like using a bridge pickup) or mellow (like using a neck pickup), depending on how high or low you crank it.  I like it all the way up, for I like sharp distortion, but the point is, is that the option is open to you.  It really is a custom pedal, made for artists who like to own their own sound.  This thing will get the job done.                
Honestly, if you're a complete, 100% noob, you might want to settle for the regular DS-1 Distortion like I did before moving onto the MT-2, because this pedal requires a little bit of knowledge, but even more of a trained ear.  Although 4 might not be a big number, you'll be suprised at how much you can do with those, and it may be a little overwhelming to the complete beginner.  But once you get a very basic hint, it's very very easy to use.                
This product is just like everyone says.  A tank.  I constantly tour Japan in livehouses, and I knock this thing around by accident on stage all of the time, or backstage, or whatever the hell I might be doing.  Let's just say that I'm not the most careful of people when it comes to this thing.  Aside from the pain chipping off pretty easily, this thing is solid, and I'm very certain that it will last me until the day I die and then some.  I also find the color quite appealing.  I never knew black and orange could mix so well.  BOSS knows their stuff.                
It has already been stated that it may be pricey for those of you who have little money or who are starving artists, but even so, once you see what this thing is capable of, you'll forget about that problem, and you won't regret it at all.  Trust me.                
I only had to call them once, and that was when I owned my DS-1 because the jack "died" out on me.  They were pretty cool, and it only took a few minutes for me to figure out what was wrong.  BOSS is truly one of the best corporations in the world.  Many people say that the world doesn't care about you.  Well, the employees in BOSS truly do care about your satisfaction with their product.                
I personally believe that, if you like any form of rock, especially metal, you are not complete without this pedal.  It should be the sole fundamental of any metal musician.  Not only is it pretty good looking (at least to me), the sound kicks every other distortion pedal's ass right out of the water.                
This is the best distortion pedal ever made, and ever will be made.  Although this pedal is 16 years old, is still remains to be truly the greatest metal pedal.  It will last you a lifetime of perfect sound.  As you get older, it's normal that you will rather stray from heavier stuff, but it's okay, because the MT-2 covers you.  This can be a badass metal distortion pedal, or it can be a light overdrive pedal.  it's anything you want it to be.                
it farl steller but i dont think that its as metal as i would like it 
for i want it to be more brutal but that might be my fender twins fault                 
the pedal is very simple and easy to use 
and its nice to look at the eq on it is amasing                
its veary easy to use                 
it is very good i play it for hours at a time and i havent had one problem 
but i have only owned it for a couple of mounths                 
it great i would have paid another houndred dollers forit                 
there isnt any need for but i dont think so                
it realy turns the ladys on when you pull out a guitar and do a nose bleedingly fast solo
in to a neck snaping metal rift                 
im glad i bought it but if an one knows of another pedal that is beter for death metal 
i would love to know 
contact me at monky-maker@hotmail.com                
i got the MT-2 just a month ago and its been hard to put down the guitar ever since. i used to rely on multi processors before getting the MT-2 and i have to say there is a major difference. Notes sound definitely cleare with the MT-2 even when compared to the metal dist of the ME-50. I got a GE-7 immediately and man have i been crushing walls with them two together. its a classic nothing will ever replace it.                
the 3 band EQ..enough said                
what i like about it is that you have to do the tweakin ur self unlike the spoon feeding multi processors give you..and its not exactly easy but man is it rewarding once you get the sound you want out of it                
its a BoSS,,,                
worth every buck..                
I think if your that guy or gal who would want to ride into the world of building an analog setup..especially if your that kind who wants versatility,dammit get an MT-2...life time investment is the word.                
In-freakin-credible! The Distortion is so heavy you will blow the brains of whoever is listening!                
Four Equalizers!                
Just plug and play, after you get the hang of the equalizers.                
Solidly made!                
It is worth every penny.                
Well, I have never had much problems with BOSS equipment, but they are helpful when it is needed.                
The genius of the pedal is so appealing, you will wonder how they did it.                
I will be satisfied with this product for several years. It has a wonderful tone and make that you can never go wrong with.                
The sound is wonderful!The only thing I can say is : OMFG SHE'S AWESOME!!!                
Power Cable sure does help a lot...                
You'll need some skills to be able to get an incredible sound like Iron Maiden,Megadeth...                
Everything's fine but sometimes...You can hear the radio...? Just forget that and play like hell!                
The price's a little high but when you can afford it...It doesn't cause much problem.                
It needs time like every company...                
You MUST own it.                
Nothing's better.                
4 equalizers!!!!! Rocks!!!                
Boss pedals are made of steal!!!!! Never will break.                
Great sound, tone and very versitile.                
im not sure what everone is raving about. this pedal sounds weak to me no settings i have it on. i play it with my 60watt marshall and the only way i use the pedal is on the distortion channel. i use my marshalls distortion and just use the pedal to adjust the highs and lows and mids.                
it made my single coils sound like humbuckers...i dont know like it made my crappy little practice amp sound like this huge tube blaster...i love that little thing...                
i like how it has complete access to controlling its equalizer so that way you can tweak it to whatever sound you want out of it                
the thing is a tank and can survive a bazooka...its really well made                
i dont know but boss is pretty good so id say it would be a good call                
it makes my friends jealous cos they only have little digitechs...                
boss metal zone is all i need for my tone in terms of metal...im set with it and im very pleased with it                
Wow, sound quality was un-beatable.  Awesome for metal / Punk rock Riffs and Solo's, absolutely awesome.  The brand name says it all.  BOSS                
Awesome make, holds together.  Looks BOSS                
WOW, can't beat the price, and best product ever for that price too.                
Wow, looks awesome, beautifull.  ITS BOSS!                
Beyond satisfied, 9 out of 10 since they didnt give it a polished gold finish, that would make a 10.                
When i got it, i first played it in a show so i didnt had time to make any setting so i was not really happy of the sound but when i plugged it at home i was surprised of its versatility                
this is a tank man                
To pricey but i really needed it so...                
You got to buy this if you like metallica megadeth etc... but if you prefer nu metal and stuff go for the digitech's metal master.                
ITS SO GOOD!!                
THEY ROCK                
VERY WELL MADE                
a little pricey, but its worth it                
DONT NEED IT YET                
chick magnet                
When you want metal you got it!  When you want to acent your guitar a little better you got it!  Its everything I've ever wanted and more!                
I use it alot, just wish the screw that holds the plate down over the battery was more secure, you can step on it bout 15 times, before the screw comes to use to use, easy to screw back in on stage though!                
I abuse this thing like crazy, when im up on stage, I go nuts, and have jumped on this thing like and elephant!                
It was worth the money I spent.                
never had to use it                
no comment                
Anything you need in a distortion pedal!                
high and low varibles on both of the equilizers, which allows for guitar solo sounds on the bottom strings aswel as heavy, dirty sounds on the top 3 strings                
it seems to be well built had no problems but mien came with 1 year guarentee from the shop and a 3 year with Boss                
it cost me                 
best distortion ever!!!                
features are perfect                
A1 quality....will never break....unless u smash it with a sledge hammer                
this pedal is worth every penny...buy it!!                
havent dealt with company                
i borrowed this pedal from my friend and it is incredible...ill probably be buying it soon                
i will be satisfied as long as the pedal works, and i dont think it will break                
Great Distortion                
Great                
Made extremely well. I've dropped it out a second story window and its worked better than ever.                
a little expensive but so worth it                
i dunno                
its....great                
I love it. I'll never use any other distortion pedal again.                
This baby ownz.  You can get just about ANY sound you want out of it.  I kind of would like to see about 10% more distortion capabilities though.  It has plenty of distortion but for me, I'd like to see just a little bit more.                
Everything you want: 3-band EQ, dist and level controls                
Built like a tank.  Body is all metal with rubber thing on bottom so it wont slip.                
It's a very nice pedal.  For $80 bucks its a sexy deal but some people can't spit out $80 bucks so it'd be nice if it were a little bit cheaper...like 60's range.                
Never dealt with them.                
Already have it.  The orange and black create a sexy appeal.                
VERY good deal.  I guarantee that you'll be satisfied with this pedal so if you're thinking about getting it, do it.                
Great sound you can get a powerfull bassy sound, crank the mids up and get some huge harmonix or take up the treble and in any ways after you find your preset(which can take a while) you will get an awesome sound that you won't ever want to play without.                
The 4 band EQ is pretty usefull because you have 2 for the mids and it really is the knobs that change the sound of this baby                
It's really built hard, I could never break it even if I like jumb on it                
Great for the price, I would pay pretty much anything to get a sound like that                
If it would break(almost can't happen), I'd buy another one                
Awesome product, the greatest distortion I have ever heard                
Yes, I have a fender stratocaster. And i used to have a DOD Death Metal distortion pedal. And it still sounds like a classic guitar. But when i brought home the Metal Zone from boss, the stratocaster does not sound close to the stratocaster. And unlike any other distortion pedal, you can set it to any type of distortion.                
You can use a ricinbacher and it would sound like a really heavy guitar.                
Yes i the Death Metal distorion lasted for only 6 months cause there is something wrong with the foot switch. Well I decided to get the metal zone and i have it for two years and it still works.                
All that i can say is it can blow away the overdrive on the amp and any other distortion pedal.                
No i have no dealt cause i know a lot of people that has boss pedals. Its not easy to reach in my neighborhood cause i live too far away for a music store. Plus i never needed any service it still works excellent.                
Not even with the stratocaster. The stratocaster plays good but with distortion, i dont like the sound of that. But with the metal zone, it sounds like a heavier guitar.                
I don't know but i will be waiting for another suprise. Metal Zone is tough to beat.                
Heavy distortion, very brittle sounding.  Great for heavy/thumping palm muting. Only sounds good in the bedroom. Does not cut through when gigging with a band (trust me).  Definitely fun to play with.                
Lots of tone control. But you can't get a natural "wet" distortion out of it.  Good for metal sound. Don't try to play blues or classic rock with it.                
One-trick pony. Does not cut through in a band setting because it has no mids                
Like I said: sounds cool in your bedroom.                
I've been playing for over 30 years, rock and blues primarily. I don't gig anymore. I do a ton of recording in a home studio. I have a pedal Pedal Train Pro board with 14 pedals in all, 4 different distortion/fuzz/overdrive pedals and a Flanger and Phaser, all of which produce unwanted noise in addition to noise generated by the guitar pickups, single coil or humbuckers. This pedal allows me to run the distortion peds and the phase/flange through the loop while keeping my time based pedals (reverb and delay) out of the loop so that the gate does not impede the reverb/delay. This pedal does a great job. My only regret is that I did not buy this years ago. As for the pedal coloring the sound? I hear no difference whatsoever. Loss of tone is not so much a pedal problem but having is caused by a long signal chain. If you hear the tone change try using the tone control on your ax, on your amp, or on your pedal board. That's why we have them. It's not rocket science.                
I keep reading a lot of reviews about how it kills your tone.  The only difference that I've noticed was just a little bit of a volume decrease, but all I have to do is turn it up louder.  I am using this pedal on a 200W Traynor tube amp head and a Marshall 1960A cabinet.  It will definitely kill the unwanted sound immediately.                  
Don't really need too many features on this.  What's on the pedal is all you need.                
It really wasn't that hard to get it setup.  But I will tell you right now, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!  It will tell you what the knobs do and how to set it up properly.  Once I read the instructions I set it up in no time.                  
It's a Boss pedal and it's built like a tank.                  
For the price I got this for it was worth every penny.  Get a daisy chain to supply other effects pedals that you have.                  
I got tired of hearing the unwanted noise from my amp at shows and band practices, so I wanted this pedal.                
Since I own the Metal Zone pedal, I expect this to last for a very long time.  I've only had a few effect pedals go bad on me, but they weren't Boss products.  If it ever went bad on me I would definitely buy another one.                  
This product works great after dis/od box. This product fails if you use amp distortion. Using this product in the fx loop produces bad results. If you use amp distortion I would recommend an isp noise reduction product or a MXR Smart-Gate in the fx-loop.                
When it comes to noise reduction it has all the knobs you need and a nifty silent mode. The drawback of having to run your fx threw the Ns-2 Separately from your guitar creates a more cluttered pedal board, Awkward cables are needed in order to get your last fx units sends back to the Ns-2 input, and this could be avoided if boss switched the fx inputs inputs around.                
Very easy to use product.                
Very dependable.                
Great value compared to what els is on the market.                
Boss support is very easy to get.                
It looked nice and easy to use.                
Gets the job done for moderately noisy equipment.                
I turned it on then off then on over and over again and could hear ZERO difference in quality!! This thing doesn't weaken or change your tone!                
Nothing came with it but what else do you need.                
Extremely user friendly I pulled it out of the box plugged it up played with the settings for about a minute and it worked great!                
Great quality of course its a Boss....                
I would have paid more for this product!                
haven't needed it.                
Its a sexy compact Boss Pedal!                
An amazing product, I had major noise coming from my amp and just plugged the thing up and it was all in the past.                
Before commenting on the BOSS NS-2 I should describe my rig: Mexican Tele w/ vintage '54's, NS-2, TU-2, Xotic RC Booster, Xotic AC Booster, CH-2, back to the NS-2, and finally to a Fender Blues Jr. Every guitarist is familiar with the infamous 'buzz' or 'hum', which is usually a result of single-coil pickups or simply electricity. Why wouldn't anyone buy a 'noise suppressor'? Let's take the "Hush" pedal for example. I experienced a great deal of sound degradation and returned the pedal an hour later. My guitar lost its natural tone, punch, and harmonics. So I figured that all 'noise suppressors' acted the same way and quickly lost interest in any such product. I recently put this rig together and gave 'noise suppression' one more shot. I picked one up and I love it! My sound is hardly affected. I keep the 'decay' at a minimum and put the 'threshold' at around 11 'o clock. This way the hum is barely detectable even in a quiet room by myself and my Tele still has its twang. This is the pedal to get. Essential for all guitarist. It's like taking the heartburn out of hot sauce and keeping all of the flavor.                
The NS-2 offers the option of powering additional pedals using a 'daisy chain', which is very useful. I placed the 'decay' knob at the minimum, which makes me wonder why it's even there. I wish BOSS would combine the NS-2 and the CS-3. This would save me some time and space.                
BOSS and beauty don't really go hand in hand, but this pedal along with other BOSS stompboxes are built like little tanks- reliable like a Honda and tough like Ford                
Price is very reasonable for the rewards and benefits of use                
N/A                
The pedals looks decent. I wouldn't have purchased it if it resembled a cookie.                
This is a keeper and if something happened to it...I'd buy another one.                
Pedal was easy to setup. No more noise when I stop playing while using my distortion pedals.                
Pedal does exactly what it is supposed to do. Takes the feedback from my hot humbuckers and tames it.                 
I use a large amount of gain between my amp and my ts9 overdrive and the NS-2 completely takes out the squeals that I can't stand. Also made my playing better due to everything getting noise gated.                
As usual Boss has come up with very unique ideas.  This is one of them that I am very impress with. It makes my Bass sound dynamic with the Fat Lows and the Punchy Mids and Crunchy Highs.  I am pleased to have it in my rig.                
Not really but for the price I got it for with the 3, 6" cables and the Boss PCS 20A parellel DC cords (Daisy Chain) plus 1 SPOT power adapter.  Hey I can't complain I am totally happy.. All for $75.97 Hey I am happy with tax and all.. LOL...                
As usual all Boss products are constructed very well.  I have no doubt in the material..                
Yes I got it at a heck of a price, I am happy... LOL                
No doubt but I was hoping to find a owners manual just like most of the other companies I have found online.  Just in case I lose mine I could download it and print it out online..                
Let's just say I am not kinky but the product suits the taste.. LOL..                
Well I can alway make additions to what I have now.  Because it is expandable..                
Does not change your tone if you set it up properly.  I read a zillion negative reviews by people who didn't use this correctly and then thought it was the pedal's fault.
Use all 4 jacks...this is not the same type of pedal as the mxr smart-gate or isp decimator, etc.   It's more like the ISP Decimator G-String but you get the save yourself $120 getting this instead of the g-string.  I've owned both and they're both great but this affords you more tweaking options and is way cheaper.                
All the things you need a gate to do in a guitar rig, this does.  Note:  It will not eliminate the sound from ground loop hum...if that's your problem, please look elsewhere.  (Ebtech makes some good devices for that ailment)                
I only gave this an 8 because although it couldn't be easier to use people seem to constantly use it wrong and then bash it for poor results which are, by and large, their own fault.  
For this to sound good right you'll need:
Dirt pedals into a clean amp or,
A separated preamp / power amp setup or,
An amp with a series effects loop (preamp out, poweramp in)
Your guitar goes into the NS-2 then out of its "Send" jack into your amp then from the amp's fx loop send into the "Return" jack on the NS-2 then out of its "out" jack into your delay, reverb, time based fx, then into your amps fx return.  
It will do what you hope it will in this configuration.  
Simply plugging this in between your guitar and amp is a waste of your time and money.  Also, never ever put delays, reverbs, time based effects before the ns2 or in its loop.  It will sound stupid that way.                
Its a boss pedal so you're good for at least 5 years out of this baby.                
When compared to the only equivalent noise suppressors on the market, this thing is a steal.  It does more than the MXR, the Rocktron, the cheaper ISP.  Its a great deal for high gain applications.                
haven't needed their help                
If you play rock, metal, hell even heavy blues, and you don't have a noise suppression system you're doing yourself, your tone, and especially your audience a disservice.  
If you need a noise suppression pedal...get this one.  Its dirt cheap for the help it'll give you and you won't be disappointed.                
If this breaks I'll buy another one instantly.
This shuts up your hum, hiss, and feedback and if you're not a dummy about how you use it then you won't even notice its on until you shut it off and hear all that old racket again.                
This noise suppressor sounds great. People say it alters ur tone..IT DOESNT. 
All it does it cut ur sustain a little bit...it works the best with humbuckers..i kno humbuckers dont make really any noise but just with my setup and surroundings i still get noise and it works amazing
On my strat however... i have to turn up the threshold up to get rid the noise when i use a lot of distortion...so it really cuts the sustain..but still works amaing...im really glad i got this one                
THe way it can power up to 7 other pedals is amazing!
i own 4 other boss pedals and a few others so it works great...
a mute mode works great when playing live and switching guitars.                
EXtremely easy of use!
much easier than like the MXR Smart Gate
(which also a very nice pedal)                
its built just like any boss pedal...STRONG!                
hmm...welll...85 bucks...a lot of money,but for the way it powers other pedals really made me buy this...
so                 
Boss is my favorite brand of pedals..i own five....Any question i ever had ,i always got a answer.                
umm... 
not really .. is doesnt look as impressive as the boss PH-3 or GT-8 or DD-6 Or PS-5...                
amazing...not a waste of money                
Well no sound is what you want here and yes, it delivers.
All the way on, things start to fade a bit.                
Don't use the decay or just set on min., mute is handy, plus power out is a great bonus to have.                
very solid unit                
hmmm. yeah I supose value was right.                
Boss are always good in this department                
I wanted it and was'nt let down.                
need to buy power apptor.                
This is where it separates from all the rest; i've used HUSH and MXR noise gates and BOTH left me lacking.  The HUSH worked great at killing the noise but it COMPLETELY clamped ANY sustain OR volume and the MXR well.....just sucked IMO.  This thing DOES NOT take ANYTHING away from your tone.  Dont believe the negative reviews on this, this pedal could easily sell for twice as much!  Take this from someone who; A. is a sound guru, i hate ANYTHING that colors my tone, B. someone who plays on a Peavey 5150 so needless to say that if i say this thing tames the noise, then it does! and C. from someone who is a recording nut! nothing about a bad tone can hide from me and this thing IMHO is as important to my rig as any guitar or speaker!                
Another great thing about this pedal, it can kill ANY noise produced by either your guitar's feedback in the front of the amp AND any noise that is produced by efx/in the efx loop AT THE SAME TIME!!!! what more could you want?                
Read the manual folks, its all there.........                
Its a friggin' Boss pedal remember? In the guitar community, when you hear Boss, you KNOW you are getting quality product.                
Invaluable!  Once you get this thing figured out to your liking, you will NEVER want to part with it!                
N/A. Never had to deal with them.  I've had a few questions about other pedals online and i received emails within less than 24hrs so id say its pretty good but the way i feel about it is, the quality in their pedals leaves no need for customer support.                
Appeal? READ THE REVIEW!!!!! Nuff' said!                
I couldnt be any happier with this pedal.  It does what i need and thensome.  Its a BOSS so im sure it will outlast my current band lineup LMFAO!!!!  Here's an example; i had a buddy that i let borrow my SD-1 about 10yrs ago, he brings it back, we BS some and lay it on the side of his truck.  Well, he goes to leave, then i see the pedal fall off the truck, then get RAN OVER and it DIDNT LEAVE A SCRATCH AND TO THIS DAY PLAYS LIKE NEW!!!!! and we arent talking a Ranger or Tacoma, it was full sized 2500HD chevy!!!! Tough as nails and simply put - THE BEST!!!!                
Sound? The point is to have less sound isn't it?                
There really are no features but the features that it don't have get an automatic 10 because it's fricken Boss!                
I wouldn't know, I only tried it out in a store and really all I did was turn it on but just that made it quiet so  guess it is pretty easy.                 
Top of the line quality, I mean it's fricken Boss is it not?!                
It had a reasonable price but not quite as amzingly priced as the DigiTech stomp boxes, they are insanely cheap!!!!                
I have needed no support                
It looks okay but what really matters is the sound not looks.                 
Overall it's a top notch pedal!                
The pedal does not directly affect your sound. The purpose of the pedal is to cut down on unwanted speaker hum, effects hum, pickup hum, etc. It does a great job doing it                
Includes a mute feature to completely mute the signal, and also includes the gate/suppressor                
It takes a little tweaking to get the decay and threshold to where you want them so your signal doesn't sound choppy, but once you find the sweet spot you will only have to adjust the knobs in minor amounts                
It's a BOSS. It's a beast.                
The pedal puts a dent in the bank, but I think it's worth every penny. I bought the pedal used (but in great condition) locally for about $60. It's totally worth it. It does exactly what I was hoping it would do.                
Haven't had to use the support yet, and I'm hoping I wont have to.                
I was considering buying this pedal for a few months, but once I started playing in a band, I realized that the time was right to buy one. Before I had this pedal, I had a LOT of noise coming from my amp (the amp itself, guitar, effects, etc.) Once I got this pedal, it cut back NEARLY ALL of the noise. I am VERY pleased. I would recommend this pedal to anyone who is looking to sound a bit cleaner without all the fuzz coming from their unit.                
Dosent degrade the sound like alot of other N.S. and can have a very soft "cut" to how it ends the signal, not abrupt or irratating.                
What more do you need? In my opinion the mute option is a bonus on this thing.                
Rugid as all hell. I've dropped it, dented the floor and not even scratched the paint of this thing.                
Cheap. Effective. Easy.                
Its a white Boss pedal. No suprises, no stupid graphics, no odd shapes that are hard to work with.                
Some of my friend's have this and when they use a battery it actually kills some noise but increases the hum. Always use an AC adaptor, no matter what.                
The sound of the regular, sub and poly modes just sounds like a very unpleasant synth; not real at all.  I was looking for something to just take my acoustic down an octave; this makes it boomy and fake, and not the cool kind.  
Another complaint about the poly mode: while it does track very well (MUCH better than the OC-2), even with range maxed out, the notes get quieter the higher up the scale they are.  Your E's will be blowing out the speakers and the D's will be barely noticeable.  Also, if you're using it while you're playing chords, the pedal often picks up two notes and plays them both an octave down, which sounds like crap.  You can fix this by lowering the 'range,' but by then it's not worth it anymore except maybe on a two-chord song.
That said, the sound of the distortion setting is pretty cool though.                
If you're looking for something to experiment with, create unique sounds with, or just play with, this is your pedal.  If you're looking to sound anything like you're playing bass when you're not, move along.                
Controls are simple and straightforward, that much it has going for it.                
If the pedal had a better sound in poly mode, I'd rate this much, much higher.  But as-is, this is just too much money for a pedal that just does this much unless you're into really off-the-wall sounds.                
Over-priced unless you just really want a pedal that does what this does.                
Gave it a 5 because I've never had to use them and don't expect to.  Boss makes good stuff.                
If you want an octave pedal, you want one that sounds better than this.                
It should be noted that I use this pedal just for guitar; I'm not speaking to what this can do for a bass, but frankly, they make five-string basses for not much more than this pedal, and if you want notes lower than that you're nuts.                
The OD-1X has that mild stubble tube like sound, to all out hard overdrive. A good buy. If lost or stolen. would buy another.                
I was drawn to this pedal because I already own the Boss DA2. Boss's Multi Dimensional Processing features a clarity unattainable without it. I use this OD-1X for my slightly dirty overdrive, and the DA-2 for heavier dirt. When dialing in some low end, it never turns "flubby" or "mushy", but always clear, so your actual playing is accurately represented.                
The sound of this product is an improvement over a prior version which I own.  I've purchased this unit to replace the PS2 Pitch-Shifter Delay.  Among the improvements to the PS6 is the octave setting.  In the octave setting, the delay is now almost imperceptible.  Also, as compared to the PS2, which sounds very digital, the PS6 sounds much more musical.                
Again, this product represents a distinct improvement over the PS2 in its controls.  It has notches on two of the function keys where it makes absolute sense to have notches.  The PS2 had no notches on the Shift and interval knobs.                
Again, this product wins by comparison to its early predecessor, the PS2.  While the PS2 could generate more than one note, the second note would be another octave, and usually involve a perceptible delay.  The PS6 produces multiple tones at chordal intervals allowing me to sound like I'm harmonizing with myself, and IN KEY as a result of the intelligent pitch-shifting function.                
This is consistent as any other Boss pedal I've owned and used.  It looks good, feels solid and is road ready.                
I thought that, as compared to other Boss pedals and products, this seemed a bit on the expensive side.  However, having used it near a month now, I think it is almost worth the price.                
I have had no customer service contact with Boss.  Therefore, I cannot comment.                
I don't consider this product sexy.  It looks like all of the other Boss products.  While its functions are neat, it's not like a big, creamy distortion, or a rich sounding chorus.  It will be a long time before I find anything sexy about a digital product.  But, that's just me.                
I hope not to have to replace it ever again as this is a replacement for a similar Boss product.                
very good,no tone sucking here! and excellent tracking.                
all features are very useful except for that dive bomb tremolo deal,its an Eddy Van Halen without the floyd rose. I don't do that on every song or do that at all don't see any use for it.                
no brainer if you know your basic theory as well as scale modes                
its a Boss of course!                
Zzound gave me a good deal                
its a pedal that I use for in some songs that require little pockets of nice solos that require good harmony's. its not something thats on all the time,but when you need it at the right places of the song during live gigs its a head turner.                
The Boss PS6 is very easy to use, the knobs provide nice tactile feel, I use only occasionally, as it is not a main-use pedal as with distortion, compression and a few other pedals. It is generally a good quality unit but I've had a couple problems with it due to its design. The main problem was the on/off indicator LED, while playing an outdoor gig and I could not tell if the unit were on or off because the LED was not bright enough. The low cost Behringer's I have on my board have much brighter LEDs so I can readily tell if their on or not. As we play to the public through the PA and our stage monitors have slightly different sound, it is not readily apparent sometimes when the PS6 is on or off. During a gig, you don't want to have to listen to see if the FX is on or not, by then its too late. The other problem was the toe of my shoe, while tapping a bit to the music accidentally lifted the top of the pedal off, so during the gig I had to reach down and reassemble the unit, which fortunately was quick, but it is something you should not have to worry about while performing. So, overall, a good unit but be wary of outdoor play during daylight. Can't comment on manufacturing support as I didn't use it, so I gave it 5 stars for support. Low score on ease of use due to the LED not being bright enough, that was a big deal for me.                
Great Amplifier Head. Lots of Power, Gain, and options. However not good for a player who needs a clean channel. But for the metal enthusiasts THE 6505 + IS the amp to set the bar...                
I've been playing guitar for quarter of the century but never owned a looper before, big mistake on my part, so when i decided to get one i did an extencive research, Dito was always at the top of a list, but i am an old timer and i started with Boss pedals 
just looking at one makes me feel like a teenager again, i also wanted something very simple and easy to use, the RC 3 looked like an obvious choice for just a little more cash, but who really needs 99 presets 3 hours of looping and cheesy drum beats with tiny little buttons to push to complicate things, no not me, one thing that attracted me in RC1 was a loop indicator, in fact i can't believe this is the only pedal that has one, seems like such an essential part of the pedal, i use the visual cue 100 precent of a time and can't imagine not having it in the looper, it shows you exactly where you are in the loop such an awesome idea and it looks great visually as well, however there is one flaw with the device, when you erase the loop by pressing down and holding for 2 seconds, you also get 2 seconds play back of the loop before its gone, thats not much of a problem for home use, but essentially renders the device unusable in the live situation, also from the online forums i have learned that the external foot switch cures that problem, i am yet to test it since i don't have one, however in my opinion such an omission should have never happened on the part of Roland, other than that after a few days of having the pedal i would still highly recommend one even if you need to get an external switch, there is just nothing else on the market with visual loop progression , also the audio comes out in CD quality i beleive no matter how many layers you create they are all perfectly balanced and sound like a professional sound engineer mixed them up.                
Very user friendly, very impressed with how "on time" it seems, I love this, I've gotten way better at my licks from practicing, and I've even layered beats , keyboards, and vocals, vocal looping is amazing, and thank you zZounds for the payment plan, now i feel like a pro and still have cash in my wallet!!!                
This product did what I expected. I wanted a tool to help me with lead guitar breaks, and harmonica solos. By laying down a rhythm progression, I am able to play it back, and work on these breaks to hone them to my liking. I was having difficulty with one particular song on the harmonica parts only to discover that I was using the wrong key harp. I'm only using it as a practice tool, and it works great as accompaniment.                
Had the orig. ditto for years thinking it was alright. Then purchased the EHX Nano 360 and the EHX 720,not being happy with either I returned and purchased the RC-3 Boss and it was so intuitive and feature laden I wish I'd have purchased this one first. The boss rc-3 is hands down my fav looper. I hate complicated pedals and this has Sooo many easy to use features that none of the other loopers have is unbelievable, especially being this looper isn't much more than it's competition-if you could even call it that. Plus with all the updates over the years. Thanks Boss! Am super fussy and REALLY liking this pedal. And thanks to zZounds for always giving me the best prices!                
Sound quality seemed good. This is the first and only pedal I've owned, so i can't compare to anything else. I played a Casino through a Vox Valvetronics amp. The recording seemed to be a bit soft, but can be adjusted with the output volume.                
Again, rating 8s across the board as I have no other comparisons to make, but it's plug and play. Super easy to use. I didn't like the original set-up with the record-overdub-playback order with the pedal, but it's super easy to change the order. Instruction very easy to follow.                
Seems solid. The single pedal rocks around a bit on the floor, but that's more the nature of its size. It's a solid piece of equipment.                
For what I wanted this is totally worth it. Love the included rhythm tracks. Super easy to use. Other items in this range seem short on features, so this is worth it.                
I got what I wanted and expected out of this pedal. Easy to use and great if you're on a budget.                
Great workout on songs tool and also a great solo player unit I can sing the songs better and play lead over the rhythms I record. Right now using about 20 of the 99 presets available.                
Does exactly what it is supposed to. The sound is true to what you played. And the volume of the loop is great for control at a live setting.                
I am having a blast with this loop station. Gotten to the point where it sounds like a full blown band with just one guitar. Now, I just sit back a play to my own background music. Anyway I want it........                
this thing is crazy cool to play with records and plays back exactly what you play through it .still learning but you take it out off the box and start jamming .thanks zZounds you are my go to music store                 
It duplicates exactly what you play into it. It has some cool effects that sound great but for what Im doing with it, I haven't found a use for them yet. Once you get your timing down for starting and stopping your loops you've got it made.                
The effects sound really cool but probably my least useful feature so far. For acoustic I'm just using a little chorus and reverb. The most useful is having two independent loops. I also bought the Boss fs6 foot switch which I recommend if you intend to use it live. It allows you to switch between loops on the fly.                
Sounds great from square 1. Very easy to use. As long as you have good timing you won't have any problems. If your timing is off your loop won't sound right when it loops but after a little practice you'll be making great sounding seamless loops.                
It's built like all Boss pedals. Solid as a rock. When Im on the road Boss is the only brand pedals I use and I've never had one fail me yet.                
I was a little hesitant at first because their are cheaper loopers on the market but the cheaper ones don't have the features this one has and after receiving and using this product I'd say it's worth twice what it sells for.                
I've never dealt with them because I've never had one of their products go down.                
I've had nothing but great experiences with Boss pedals and always look to them first when shopping pedals.                
I've been a Boss customer for a long time and I've thoroughly enjoyed this product to say the least. First and foremost, when you buy a Boss pedal the sound is second to none and the quality is the best I've seen in a pedal and this one is no differen. All steel cconstruction like all their pedals. The possibilities are endless with the rc-30. I bought it to use with my acoustic. I'm in the rock band Another Beautiful Letdown and my singer and I recently started picking up some acoustic gigs during down time to keep busy and keep our chops up. I mainly use this pedal to loop rhythm parts so I can add the lead parts live without the rhythm dropping out. I can tell that Im going to use this pedal alot the more gigs we do. I've only had it about 3 weeks so I've only tapped the surface of what this thing can do. I also like the rhythm section to use to just jam. It has 9 different rhythms and you set your own tempo. We build and layer our loops live so the crowd can hear each part being added but you can also save your loops to recall later which is cool. You can also load files from your computer to loop which I have not gotten to yet but Imsure tthat's in the near future. I could go on and on and I've only had the pedal 3 weeks. If your reading this you've come to the right place. You won't find this product any cheaper than Zzounds and their customer service is top notch. I highly recommend this product and Zzounds and I'll definitely continue to shop here.                
sometimes I have trouble getting one sound louder than the other. I wonder where all the deleted music or mistakes go. I hope not in the hard drive. over all it is a keeper.I use it 3-5 times a week.And I play for hours when i use it. I run it through a mustang 3 so i look for the clean channels.                
It didn't come with anything,but software, which is ok for the price. the auto looper comes in handy, and it takes a little time to get a true loop with no spaces. All and all i think boss did a good job.  everything is good and up to pare.                
It has a good sound. I run my cry baby wa wa pedel and my boss distortion peddel throught it. It is a no brainer to use, just read the manual and you will be fine.                
It is built like a tank I don't use a backup. Take your time and learn the in's and outs. I still wonder where the deleted mistakes go because sometimes i make a lot of them when i cant get something right. But so far so good. I have owned it since june 2011.                
I think it is a good price. worth every penny.                
no so far i have not had a problem with it                
I think it has great sex appeal. It makes me a better guitar player on my leads. It is great looking and i like the color and the way it lights up. It is a A plus in my book. GET ONE.                
I will use this for a long time. I will always have good words about this product. I will not bad mouth other products. I had a few loopers and I didn't like them. But fell in love with this one.                 
I'm a bassist in a rock band but also a proficient keyboardist.  When I'm playing in my rock band I hate having to lug my keyboard gear for only a few songs we do that require some keyboard lines.  This pedal was the answer!  I simply sampled and saved the required lines.  Now all I have to bring is this pedal and by choosing the correct sample number I simply press the foot pedal on the required parts and voila'!  I have keyboard lines.  Excellent sample reproduction and works flawlessly.  My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a power adapter.  Batteries work fine but batteries die.  So I'll be getting an adapter.  Otherwise, another solid product from Boss!                  
This Boss looper has excellent sound quality. Nice to have individual faders for each loop.                 
Many features for the money. I know there are those to lament the lack of MIDI (as do I). And the effects included are pretty much useless for my needs. I don't like having the two pedal contraption hanging off to increase/decrease the loop. Why not just have a dedicated switch(es)?
Also, NO POWER ADAPTER! Why do I have to spend $24.95 for a power adapter? Plus, the older power adapters don't appear to work with this unit.                
A few of the functions are tricky to understand (the two separate tracks for ex.).                 
Appears to be rock-solid like all Boss products.                
I guess it is a pretty good value as the Boomerang III is $469.00.                
No idea.                
N/A                
Nice looper. I've had them all over the years. For approx. $300, you can't gp wrong.                
To begin I love this pedal. It reminds me of a digitech I had back years ago. This pedal has a long duration of play back though, you can play back a whole song if you want. Not to mention the effects you can put to what your looping. My only issue is the ease of use, the double click of the pedal while trying to keep the rhythm goin. I do recommend this pedal and for the price it can't be beat this one has two tracks compared to the other boss which is only one.                
Great loop station. Works great, and you can put together some great stuff.,ZOUNDS is a great online music store, play as you pay is a great service. Will highly recommend ZZOUNDS.                
It does not color your tone at all. Whatever comes in is what goes out. The only down fall I've found is when playing back a loop and playing over it it's a little tricky to mix them properly when your using one amp. I use two amps and it sounds awesome.                
The most useful feature about it is being able to create a loop using reason or fruity loops and store into the pedal. I can create a backing track for each song on the set list, store it and play it back live. You can also store a file like that then overdub a rhythm live and your free to play lead over that. The least usefull feature for me are the built in effects. I do all that before the rc-30.                
To get the full awesomeness from this pedal and do it with quality results is an involved process. It's not plug and play, but I like that.                
Built like a tank.                
A great value! It may seem pricey but for what it allows you to do its well worth it. I bought this pedal and now I play keys, synth, all kinds of electronic stuff, rhythm and lead guitar and I do it all without ever taking my hands off of my guitar.                
I have not needed to contact customer support.                
Its sexy. Also everybody I know wants one. If you have it your the man. If you use it with skill your even more the man.                
I love it!!!                
Its a great thing to have for practice at home or jamming with others. There's so much recording time on each slot, you'll never run out of time. And the usb port, auxillery plug, and mic port make it THAT much better. The only problems that I do have, is that when using batteries they die quickly (about 3-5 days depending on usage) but that's why they have the AC adaptor; also it only has 10 drum patterns, more would be better.                 
There was no loss of signal when switching between the station and my other effects rig the sound is clear                 
Call me old school but I like having an on/off knob or switch  instead of an input jack to turn the unit on/off plus the risk of loosing data when pulling a jack when in a mode is scary otherwise it is well organized                
Took me a while to "learn how to record and overdub" along with the rhythm track but once I got its been a lot of fun                 
Well made as usual  with all of the boss line of products                 
Great for the money                 
Have not needed it yet don't expect too                
Have one                 
Hope to have this box for a long time it's a ton of fun . Never had so much fun playing with myself                
Great stereo loop  that is easy to use and allows the artist maximum flexibility.                
I am not experienced with looping gadgets or other similar devices; this is a new part of music for me. My experience so far is that the sound is good on one or 2 layers or loops. After several layers it starts to sound 'digitized' which is too bad, because that's when it gets really fun.                
I chose this model for the XLR input and the large memory capacity.                
It is very intuitive to use ... except the 'save' function. It is easy to hit the wrong button and erase something.                
The buttons are solid. The pedals are solid. It is sturdy and well assembled.                
It was a good value which is why I chose this model as compared to competing models and brands.                
not needed yet ...                
A practical addition and a nice introduction to effects for processing acoustic sound.                
I like that it is a quick and simple way to record myself for learning new tunes and arrangements.                
It's a little tricky to get the hang of it, but once you get timing down this pedal can really help you improve and impress on many levels.                
i have bought almost every looper available in the last year or so. several of them were very nice. each had strong points and weak points.
 the boss rc 300 is as close to my dream looper as i can get at this point in time.
 it is VERY simple to use. i've read that some folks have had skips at the end of their loops and can tell you, that is an operator problem. all looping requires something from the operator even when quantize is working. my loops are seamless and have great sound quality.
i use this looper live, on the street along with a boss me-70 and roland qube street amp.
i run all off of a small booster battery and dc/ac inverter. i can play all day long and never run out of power. best of all, i have quality sound in a mobile rig.
i havent even scratched the surface of what the rc 300 can do. it is an amazing piece of equipment.
Excellent product for many, many applications. The BOSS RC 300 can be set up to function in a way that best compliments your needs no matter what you have in mind. For me, I found the phrase memory parameters easy to program for a variety of templates. The RC 300 manual is straight forward and very simple to follow. I set up a generic phrase memory template for constructing songs/instrumentals. Track 1, track 2 and track 3 are programmed to work out verse/chorus/bridge song formats. The modular style record/playback and overdub allows me to find the best sequence for a new song. I can record a verse, a chorus and bridge with the ability to re-record if the first take isn't satisfactory. In a nut shell, this loop station is a real time tracking/overdub and mix session with the option of saving each project to a phrase memory. This phrase memory can be named in the RC 300 and then exported to a computer for future use as well as additional tweaks. I could go on forever writing about the RC 300 but choose to stop here. If you can think it then the RC 300 can make it happen. Another solid, complex yet user friendly noise toy from the BOSS team. Well done BOSS and thanks for making the creative process that much more enjoyable. A+++, get this loop station and be amazed.                
This is a great tool and a must for any serious guitar player. It will greatly improve your playing and song writing skills.                
Yeah this is everything I was expecting it to be. Been checking it out for a few months and finally pulled the trigger and got it. Glad I did. There are a few really good videos on YouTube about how to dig in and customize, which are more helpful than the manual or Boss videos - but the tutorials are out there and will help. It's a bit daunting otherwise to jump right into, so make sure you get familiar with those videos. I've only scratched the surface on what this can do, but as far as quality, it's solid. Very sturdy, seems like it'll last a long time. Hoping to put a live show together, as it's getting harder and harder to get guys to commit to a consistent band.                 
Although I am still getting used to all of the tricks and techniques, the RC-300 was pretty easy to get started with. If you take the time to understand the options for each loop, then you'll avoid having the "gap" issues where the loops don't align...seriously, it's not that hard. The one disappointing thing is the expression pedal...it seems to be an all or nothing proposition at times, and it will power-up in the of position when it's off, and sometime when you go from max to min, it doesn't catch the "off" position, and just keeps affecting the audio. A quick wiggle of the pedal will usually fix it, but it shouldn't happen at all IMO.                
There is a learning curve, but don't be discouraged.  This pedal creates soooo many possibilities for a solo act like me.  I am in love it.  I would suggest investing in an external footswitch or two, as many important features essential to live performance are not readily available on the fly.                
The fasted way any guitarist can learn to solo over back tracks. You can easily load up a cd, back track or what ever recording and blend your own sound on top. Instant band to back you and very simple to use. The effects on board are also great no peddles needed. Hooks up to any one of my many amps with ease.                
The RC-300 is more than just a pedal, it's the future of music in ways that we are yet to understand and experience. I'm very glad I bought it. I'm willing to bet money, in the future, we will see people doing stuff with "hardware" like this that we have never seen before. the RC-300 is the first step to a completely new approach on music, and I'm proud to say I'm one of the first to experience that. but I must admit, this product doesn't seem like the type of thing a guitar or bass player would use, it's definitely an instrument all it's own, so even though I give it a 10 for recommendation, I don't necessarily recommend it for bands as much as I recommend it for electronic musicians.                
This unit, like the old RC50 still has a momentary delay which makes it very difficult to use in live performances.  Boss is impossible to deal with; despite many kindly worded requests for support, it has become obvious that Boss could care less about individual consumers.                 
The Boss RC-505 packs in a lot of features for being marketed as "just a looper". It's really closer to a robust digital recorder or workstation than a pedal type looper. 
I purchased this to take the live recording/ looping load off of the back of my Octatrack, which in comparison has a very limited amount of recording, and most importantly, over-dubbing time. 
The RC-505 has over 3 hours of recording time, which is more than enough for most purposes. You can save all of the recordings, live while the tracks are still in playback mode. This is a huge plus if you want to take any awesome moments from your live performance back to the studio. 
Each of the 5 tracks can have their own recording length, up to 999 bars! All tracks are tempo synced perfectly and there are many options to customize how each track syncs and interacts when the previous recorded tracks. 
The fx section goes beyond what you normally get out of the built in fx in a piece of gear like this. In each fx section you have 3 fx slots that you can switch between in real time with out any hiccups or unwanted glitches. One of things that I was very happy with is that each fx slot retains the setting for all the fx on the list, so you can have 3 of the same fx set to each slot with different values, allowing you to easily "play" the fx. This is really awesome with things like delays, beat repeats and the transpose fx. Also, you get TWO of these fx sections, one for incoming audio and one for recorded audio. The only down side that I can see with the fx is that the dedicated fx knob is hardwired to one parameter per fx. This is not that big of a deal, as soon as you select an fx, the menu for send fx will come in to focus and the rest of the parameters are just 2 to 4 button presses away, allowing you to use the main data entry knob for the selected parameter.   
The midi sync on this unit is also rock solid. While researching loopers I found that midi sync is largely over looked or poorly implemented in most loopers. I have had no issue syncing the RC-505 to any of my hardware or software. When working with sequencers, you can even have the sampling start on beat, quantizing to the "one"  and easily put together group of on time rhythmic phases. 
I have not dived in to the built in rhythms, but they sound great and there are a wide variety of time signatures and styles to choose from. 
Over all, you can tell that a lot of thought was put in to making this unit playable and easy to use. From the great fx sections and versatile track editing, to how the menus are layed out, you will be able to easily and quickly integrate the RC-505 in to your live rig or studio recording set up.
I would recommend this product to anyone who who needs a good hands on looper or backing track player.                  
Moved up from a floor model (RC-3) and am amazed with this machine.   The five definable tracks (one-shot, loop) allow a lot of creative room - that I am yet to fully explore.  Switches, knobs, faders and buttons are all high quality and seem made for regular use.  I've used it almost daily since arrival with no failures of any kind.  
The onboard effects are great....enough to fully mimic famous beatboxers (dub fx, Reggie, etc) without an additional pedal.  My bass effect pedal (Zoom B1X) delivers no more than what is available in the onboard effect list, and the RC-505 has much higher sound quality than my previous efforts using a XLR converter and traditional effect pedal.  It's three types of inputs make for lots of multi-instrument fun that was previously unavailable in my smaller RC-3.    
It would be five stars for "perfect" only if a full function foot pedal was available, and if the case were a little more armored (I'm terrified of dropping it).  The Boss FS6 pedal is great but might hold back the machines full potential for those who play with two hands.  Also....Don't drop it.....ever.
Otherwise it is one of my favorite "instruments" and I highly recommend this product to those who seek the high power of an Ableton loop setup in a hardware package.
There's nothing like hardware for the stage!    
We previously owned the RC-300 which is not really designed for vocalists so this loop station is the bomb compared to the one we used before! It's lighter and smaller which is perfect for us, since we travel a lot and need to be carrying it around with us to perform all over the world.                
This is a really fun loop station with some nice basic features and some surprising flaws given its price point. You can only use one input FX, and one track FX at a time, despite there being 3 FX buttons for each. So as an effects processer for your loops it's really limited. You also can't ReSample any of the loops to take advantage of extra effects either. There is no BPM sync for the different delay effects, that was disappointing. The build quality is also really cheap, I would worry about this thing in the long haul. That beng said the basic looping features are really fun and intuitive, but for $500, I couldn't justify keeping this thing.                
I absolutely LOVE it. The looping effect with five tracks is amazing. This little thing can do quite a lot & it's fun. Perfect for a choir nerd, I'm a one woman choir!                
Great product!  I do so much with this thing.  It has expanded my musical abitilites to say the least.  I would definitely recommend this product to any one that plays an instrument.                
I loved this pedal from the start. it was everything i was looking for in my DUB. Ive heard people say thats its not the best for guitar but it works well with other pedals. I found that putting a nice phaser after it seems to help with a dynamic whoosh. Reggae lovers should have one.                
Awsome to use by hand for an outboard delay. i take it to everyone of my shows. some guys wont let me do sound unless i have it. The intensity knob is what i wanted it for. Then having the 12 mode knob settings is even more dynamic. I wish i had two of them. The tap tempo helps too for quick applications.                
It took me a while to get used to, but now i can use it with my eyes closed. I think having a small pedal or button to oscilate it would be cool. i just havent found one for myself yet. I almost wish it had a seperate out for the reverb. I like the sound it gives when its overdriven, very sonar-ish. Its application is great for keyboards. I like that the manual gives settings for classic sounds.                
I love the way this thing looks. It not only sounds cool, but looks vintage for those with that taste. Its very strong, and heavy. I love heavy equipment because theyre like old cars, it shows how good of a product it is. I really wish i knew how to make one so i could make my own.                
It's a good price for someone who really uses it like myself, but i dont think it should properly be priced above 200$.                
I havent had to deal with them directly, but im sure a company that makes a product like this would be good in all services.                
Its not comparibal to any other delay or echo. i believe its the best thing since the actual head unit itself. I carry it and play it like its my instrument, cause it is.                
Ill keep it till it breaks, i wish there was a matching phaser and spring reverb, but it could ude more helpfull style modes. Like 5 differnt tempo modes and 7 differnt styles or something. but its still a beautiful thing.                
Being my first delay pedal I can't compare it to others however it doesn't suck any of my tone. It doesn't even sound digital, cold, or sterile to me. Doesn't color my amps tone either. Make sure you use this in the effects loop however it does sound okay through the front end up my gain channel.                 
From what I can tell this has all the features of the original RE201 but in a compact stompbox.                 
This is the first pedal I've bought that the manufacturer actually provided sample settings in the manual.On the underside of the pedal has a diagram of how the different modes include which tape head sound. I found my favorite delay sound in a few minutes and now I feel like David Gilmour with this thing on.                  
It's a Boss pedal. I'll never have reliability issues. Feels nice and heavy too.                
This pedal is just like it's analog predecessor and those units are very costly on the used market. My friends RE501 tape echo/chorus unit is worth a pretty penny but my pedal does something his unit can't do and that is my pedal actually works. Boss could charge up to twice the price and still sell these.                
Being a Boss pedal I'm sure the manufacturer support is great too.                 
It does have a cool name "space echo". Sounds like something a martian left behind on our planet. It even smiles and winks at you. In fact maybe it's a space robot from another galaxy!                 
I finally broke down and decided to buy a delay pedal. At first I just wanted an MXR Carbon Copy but after selling my second amp and having extra money I decided  without hesitation to buy the RE20. I'm not going to say this is the best delay pedal on the market but it does an excellent tape delay sound for what it's worth. I really like the layout and the ability to mix tape heads and reverb. It doesn't take long at all to find a good setting either. I can't wait to use this with two amps either. I'll probably pick up the MXR someday but I won't need to.                 
havent dealt with them.                
This has taken the place of my Carbon Copy, very tweakable and sounds amazing.Also a quick shout out to Russell in Customer service,That guy goes way above and beyond for the Customer!!! Thanks Russesll!!!!                
I am a great fan of the  echo sound I am not into reverb which this unit also has to perfection.
there is nothing out there that matches this  echo sound . I use it solely for my vocals. i have never been complimented so much on my vocals since I purchased this unit. its just the best sound you could want to have and I entertain live.you can take these comments to the bank.  
a bonus would be to have 2 or three mic inputs   thank you

VERY close approximation of the old Space Echo.  Tone controls allow for nice colour adjustment of the delay sound.
Reverb isn't my favourite effect.  But this one is at least usable.  Doesn't sound springy or fake.  
Seems to be a bit more sensitive to the gain of the input - especially between the difference of clean vs. distorted qualities.  The sound is good for both.  But I have to either set it for one character or the other; or try to find a useful compromise between them.  Not perfect for both.  
The real Space echos didn't seem to do that near as much as this digital version.
But again, a really nice modern rendition of a classic.  
Has some features that are kind of cool.  But some are just useless gimicks.  
The "tape speed" indicator is cute for the first 30 seconds.  But after that, it's just a battery waster.  Doesn't really serve any useful purpose.
But all of the controls do just what they are supposed to.  
The "oscillation" effect doesn't really seem to have a real use.  (1) Since the unit sits on the floor, it would be kind of silly to have to bend down just to do some non-musical effect.  With a real tape echo, you could just reach back and do it, put the speed knob back where you want it, and it's over.  
Here; even if you did want to look dorky and squat down just for that one silly thing, just putting the knob back doesn't take it out of that mode.  Ah, the price of digital.                
If one reads the names on the knobs, it shouldn't be tough at all.  The only one that will take some figuring is the main settings knob.  And a quick read of the manual (or the bottom of the unit) and that gets cleared up straight away.
If you're used to dialing in a specific number on your digital readout, best get over that quick.  Here, your ear is the only gauge of the delay tempo that will be of any use.  It's old-school, but it works great if you just learn to work with the device instead of insisting that the device pander to you.                
Seems built lots stronger than I was anticipating.  Heavier than it looks.  Reckon I could chock the wheels of my car, should I need to change a tire, in a pinch and still expect it would sound just fine at the next gig.                  
It could have been a little less expensive.  But I'm happy I have it.  Even for what I paid for it.                  
N.A.                
Very cool.  
For folks who want GUITAR sounding effects, and/or a more vintage quality to their tone, this is a hot choice.  Even better that the panel looks just like a miniature version of the 201.  Kinda takes me back a bit every time I look down.                
A good purchase.  A happy customer.  I still like the tone of my rig even after adding this one to the chain.  I worthy addition to my music.                
I just got my Space Echo today. I experimented with it for a good 4 hours straight. It's sound is wonderful it does not color or saturate the tone of your guitar at all. Theres also no hum. In my beginners set up (consisting of a Ibanez Tube Screamer and a Boss Phase Shifter) there was a lot of noise and such. When i hooked up and turned on the Space Echo it actually took some of the noise out, not all of it, but a noticable amount. I thought that was very interesting, because i read a couple reviews saying you can hear the digital processing going on in the Space Echo. I dont hear that at all. It's rather silent i think. Also, if anything it made my guitar sound more...how do i say...clear. I dont really know how to explain it, but it makes my guitar sound better. Even just having it on but the settings turned off/all the way down. It just creates a kind of ambience behind my tone that sounds wonderful.                
The features are great. 12 reverb/echo/repeat effects plus the option to alter the repeat rate, the echo volume, the intensity, input volume, and a couple other things i forget at the moment. Theres one little feature i find quite interesting that i didn't know this could do because it's never talked about, but the Twist function is very interesting. You hold down the tap tempo pedal and it starts oscilating and making a sort of "SWOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHH" sound, it sounded like that old sound effect from a kids cartoon where the characters are in space and they like fly through a worm hole or something. Very cool. The space echo also has the ability to store a preset in the optional expression pedal. You can program the expression pedal to control the repeat rate, the intensity, the volume, or the twist. And the space echo itself can be preset to either use the standard delay times, or the longer delay times (double the standard times basically). Theres also one setting on it, i forgot exactly how i had my knobs, but it basically became a looper. Im pretty sure it was one of the repeat settings, with the repeat rate and intensity turned all the way up (not sure though) but when i played something, it'd repeat, and never stop. It was functioning as a loop pedal too. If i find the setting again i will post it somewhere.                
This thing is incredibly simple to use. The knobs are pretty self explanitory. The only thing that gets Ease of Use an 8 is that it's tough to get how they all effect each other. Also some of the features that aren't really known, such as the Twist, and storing presets (kind of) was a little difficult for me to get at first, but a quick read through the 20 page or so manual was all that was needed to understand it all, a second or third read through might be necessary for people who like to follow the book, but other wise, you should just experiment with the settings and figure it out yourself. Its a lot more fun that way too.                
This is one of the most well-built pedals i've ever seen. When i picked it up, it felt like a brick. The manual says to be careful with it, not to drop it and all that, this thing is a freakin tank. Still take care of it though, but if i drop it like once i wouldnt be too worried. Boss is known for their well built pedals.                
Took me 4 months to save up the 250 for this thing. I think it was worth it, the money it'd take to get other pedals that'd do the same thing is a lot more then this is worth. I think it was worth every penny.                
I've only had it for a day, so i haven't really needed Customer Support. I've heard they are great though.                
Black and green made me think of "What if the Green Lantern played guitar?" This would be his main pedal. It's pretty hot.                
This is by far the best thing i've bought other than my guitar. The Space Echo adds depth and ambience to my sound, something i've been looking for for a while. I love this thing, and will treat it like a son. The sound is amazing, the features are unique and mysterious even. Theres nothing bad for me to say about this thing.                
Great vintage tape echo simulation. Perfect for playing psych, kraut & prog rock. Has a unique, ragged, lost in space feel that I haven't found in any other delay. Be sure you want this sound, though it is really tweakable so I suppose more modern sounds could be coaxed out of it. I am using it with keyboards in a band situation and sounds great in that situation as well as with guitar. The only thing I don't like is there is a slight treble cut when activated, but not terrible considering.                
Plenty of tweakability, more so than others. I wish it came with an adapter, at the price it should. I am running the 6 AA batteries and they claim 36 hours which is pretty good for this hefty delay.                 
Really easy to operate. Takes some time getting adjusted to the different tape head settings. A little goes a long way with this. At loud volumes it is easy to coax into oscillated feedback.                 
I haven't used Boss pedals before, but as far as I know they are built to last. Seems very sturdy.                 
I wish it were cheaper, but it has the sound I want and need, so that satisfaction for me is worth the extra cost.                
i've owned this pedal for over a year now and it's never let me down. the sounds you can get are incredible. there's nothing quite like having a leslie at your feet. next to buying a 122 or a 147 it's the best sounding rotary emulator i've tried or heard. i owned a hammond XK-2 and the leslie sound didn't even start to compare.                
everything you need to define your sound is on this pedal, it's got all the knobs for rise time, balance and overdrive. there's even a switch to change the overdrive from guitar or keyboard. awesome. just like any boss pedal, it doesn't come with an adapter. but that's how boss is.                
plug and play. sounds great with everything at 12 o'clock. but if you're into customizing your sound, it's incredibly easy to do. everything is right at your fingertips. i keep mine on top of my keyboard and just adjust the sounds as i go. no programmable settings, just knobs.                 
just like most boss pedals it's built like a tank, like i said, i've had mine for just over a year and nothing has broken and it always sounds like the first time i played it.                
for what this pedal does, it's worth it. i mean..if you're an organist in jazz, rock, blues, etc you need a leslie or a simulator. this is the kind of pedal you'll have on all the time, every time you play. so when you think of it that way..250 isn't a lot to pay                
for me, i wanted a leslie, but this thing gives you all the tones with out having to buy a truck to cart a cabinet around. that makes it pretty desirable don't you think?                 
i don't think i'll get another rotary pedal. if this one dies (which it shows no signs of doing) i'd buy another one. obviously, it isn't a 122 or a 147, but for the size and price worth every penny.                 
Very impressive, expressive, and tuned for recording and stage. I have not found a keyboard with a Leslie effect at any price that can match the realism this pedal emulates. I no longer lug my Motion Sound around to gigs. You are no longer restricted to miking a rotor to increase volume. Just use a larger amp! No quality loss.                 
You can read about that elsewhere, but in real world use. Rotation speed, grunge, stereo! It's all there. Works well on organ and electric piano. If you forget your adapter (sold seperately) it runs on battery. Nice touch. Haven't changed batteries in 4 months. Heavy pedal so it won't slide away. Stomp worthy pedals.                
It takes a bit of fiddling but each knob returns definite audible changes so very soon you understand which knob does what. Only difficulty is having to reach down to your feet for adjustments. If only there were an extension with the controls that you could place on your keyboard.                
Built like a tank. Don't drop it. You'll break the floor.                
Can't knock the product but it is pricey.                
Dunno.                
Ummm. It stays below my shoe. The psych light's cool.                
Portability, sound quality, reliability, durability. Makes pretty much any keyboard sound like a Hammond. What's that worth to ya?                
Very hard to find but I did. I haven't even begun to touch the surface of what the RT-20 will do. But there is no doubt. It's awesome!                
So much more than I expected.                
A bit of a learning curve for me but I don't have a whole lot of time to put into it.                
Very nice.                
You're getting what you pay for.                
Rolandus.co was helpful with a couple of questions.                
It is fun to use in a dark room but that's not really all that important.                
This is a keeper. It isn't going anywhere.                
Clear and very realistic lesly sound.                
Once you get the foot pedal,  the sky`s the limit                
Simple as they come                
Solid as a rock                
I think that all musical equipment is much too expensive.                
I would imagine that it would be great but I`ve never needed it.                
I can`t get over how closely this pedal resembles an actual Lesly.  If it`s a Lesly sound that you want,  this is exactly what you need and in my experience,20 years,  it`s the best product of it`s type on the market.                
Absolutely one of the best sounding pedal Reverb’s I’ve used to date. I’ve used Strymon, Neunaber, TC Electronic, Electro Harmonix, Eventide, DigTech/Lexicon and a few others.  They all have their tone and if it works for you great.  If you want something with more dimension and realism give the RV 500 a listen. The Plate & Hall Reverb are fantastic on nylon strings.  Lots of tweaking possibilities. It’s very easy to eq the low and high trails and tone.  Right out of the box and on my Pedalboard it’s usable.  The ability to pull off my pedal-board and use with batteries is s plus for my use at gigs with no ac.  Many of the good reverb pedals on the market don’t have this option. It’s 32bit 96k sampling is an industry high. I’m liking it so far. It’s very smooth and non grainy. I don’t care for reverb of any type when there’s a grainy trail and sounds transistorized processed. I have this setup for my main Gig Rig. From the Guitars with LR Baggs Dual Source or Fishman Presus Blend.  Line in (TR)or Wireless (SaturnA/B Switcher) with Line 6 G30 to a Grace Design AliX, DÁddarío Tuner, Boss RV500, TC Ditto Looper.                
The only reason I decided to get this pedal was for the new shimmer mode because i wanted to add more to swells. The Shimmer blends beautifully when dialed correctly or it will sound really sharp-ish. The dynamic mode is really interesting cause it automatically adjust to the style you play (soft or hard picking) the delay mode is more to be desired but i guess it could get you by if you don't have one. It's no true bypass so it does color your tone a hint if you don't run it through a effects loop. If you use a battery, it will mute everything before it if it dies. This is a really versatile reverb pedal and is perfect for its time.                
This is a fantastic reverb pedal. In this day and age with soooo many boutique pedal makers offering such a variety of options it's easy to think of BOSS as the "boring industry standard"  Don't do that. 
I needed something specifically for warm deep pad sounds in church worship playing. My budget is out of the realm of a blue sky/big sky/eventide, but this thing can do exactly what I need. I use the shimmer and modulate settings primarily but this is a complex and big sounding reverb in any of the settings. When using shimmer I turn the tone to the left to get the sound I need. Turned the right I find that the higher octave algorithms sound too metallic & digital. 
I'm super happy with my purchase.                
I equate overdrives like wasabi or cayenne pepper...its got no real flavor of its own until added on top of something. Although, id say the sd 1 adds a nice high mid to your tone. Lots of extra grit on tap too..im sure out there would be curious to know that. Just remember..its overdrive, not distotion. Overdrives are transparent and sit on top of a sound, thus if you play clean channels with an od on, youll still hear the clean signal clucking under it. a distortion is for masking or creating a channel. If you play a clean channel then kick on a distortion, you basically just created a dirty channel.                
Just perfect actually                
a caveman can do it                
Its a boss...their stuff has always seen the worst and managed to keep working.                 
Considering how many idiots will spend 200 and up for something as simple and plain as an od, this is an absolute steal. It does exactly what an overdrive is meant to do. Od pedals have no business in the boutique world.its like people trying to make a gourmet french fry and charging a premium for it. at the end of the day, its still a classless french fry. An od is still an od.                
Never needed it                
Lets say this again...its just an overdrive.  It has no character on its own. Its sole purpose is simply pushing an amp                
all guitarists need an od at some point. So its nothing special, and these types of pedals arent supposed to be. Its job is usually done well no matter how much you spend.                 
I liked the overall sound a lot. The only real con is that, depending on the level, there is a high amount of feedback from the amp, though this could be worked on.                
The knobs are relatively easy to understand. High quality metal framework and no-slip rubber.                
Small, fits on most pedalboards (I have a PB1000) and, as aforementioned, the knobs are simple enough.                
You could throw this thing out of a moving car and it will probably still work.                
Besides on zZounds, I have never seen this pedal under $45-50. I think it is better to get this than to give in to a cheap pedal or maybe to even wait for a more expensive pedal.                
zZounds.com was accurate in the shipping progress, and Boss was right to boast about its quality and features.                
It is very good-looking, unlike the EHX Big Muffs that you basically have to dedicate space to -- the rubber is no-peel, and the metal frame and construction are great.                
This is a very nice pedal; it delivers hi-fidelity sounds to your amp. If anything, it has a bit of feedback and, if not kept up, isa bit squeaky when pressed.                
I would give this a 10, but if you crank the drive you can sometimes get a little hum. Other than that this pedal is INSANE! You can get a clean, boosted sound with this or you can get a really dirty grunge sound. (Oh yeah, and everything in between!) Minus the minor hum, you almost always get an incredibly crisp sound. It's fantastic!                
It's got a LEVEL, TONE, and DRIVE knob. That's really all you need for this. Adjust the DRIVE to crank the intensity and the TONE to decide whether you want to play the highs or the lows.                
It's really easy to use. You can read the manual, which is helpful. But I really just enjoyed opening it, sitting down with it, and messing with all the knobs. Turning them this way and that, I was able to get the sounds that I desired with little or no trouble at all.                
This is a BOSS pedal. These things wouldn't break if we had a nuclear war. You don't have to worry about it breaking, IT WON'T. Just be sure to only the right type of power supply (9V battery or BOSS AC jack). Mine came with the AC power supply free.                
$50 bucks for an overdrive pedal isn't bad at all. You really get what you paid for.                
Haven't had to deal with them and I don't anticipate I will have to.                
I don't really care what it looks like, but I wanted it pretty badly. I had listened to demos of it and knew it was what I was looking for.                
I probably won't replace it. Even if I become a professional musician, I don't think I'll ever have to replace this pedal (or want to for that matter).                
Very pleased with the sound. I lean more towards rock sounds - so my tone and drive are always at 3 o'clock - works well with my strat and hollowbody - especially with the humbuckers on a hollow and single-coils. Great sound.                   
The most useful feature - ONE single tone knob! No fiddling with any High/Low knobs - one tone knob is already plenty                
Very user-friendly                
Solid. Although the paint kinda chips off easily in some places.                
Affordable. Nicely priced.                
No problems so far - don't expect any anytime soon.                
Based on the sound, I'd say this is one great overdrive pedal - would like a Blues Driver to pair with this, though.                
Great for what I need and what I do                
A well made good solid OD pedal for the money but not what I was looking for. I found it hard to dial in my tone. The SD1 had a little to much edge for me as I was looking for a warmer, smoother OD and ultimately  exchanged it for a TS9 tube screamer which I'm very happy with.                
The SD-1 is a controversial pedal in the sense that most people buy it for the wrong reasons. I myself fell into that catagory once upon a time. I would read in my favorite guitar mags about my heroes using it in their setup. You know, guys like Zakk Wylde and Eddie Van Halen who are world renown for great tone have this same yellow box on their pedalboards, so I thought this is the key to achieving great tone. This wasn't the case. The SD-1 on its own, with all the controls maxed, is not a high gain affair. So in that aspect I shelved the thing for years. As time went by though I changed my musical tastes a bit, now I lean more towards the classic country sounds of the late 60's, guitarists like Don Rich and Roy Nichols and modern day guys like Pete Anderson and Marty Stuart. Now suddenly I find this pedal to be the cream of the crop. With the drive set at around 9 o clock or less it adds the right amount of grit to a clean Fender Tube amp. Low end licks stand out in the mix much better and it adds a good amount of sustain and clarity for pedal steel licks as well. If rockabilly and roadhouse blues are your thing or if you are looking for a touch of natural sounding overdrive this is the pedal for you. Barn burners need to pass this on by though. No high gain here.                
I give it a nine because it is simple, not a lot of features, just the right ones.                
I have owned it 10 years without any worries, can't say that about the rest of my equipment.                
Great tone at half the price of Ibanez TS9. Why shell out the dough? Save it for strings.                
Never had to deal with the company but I have heard good things.                
The all metal case is the most appealing. I have owned plastic pedals that have basically been destroyed by use or accidents. Never let the drummer help you load your equipment!                
Like I said earlier, most people buy the SD-1 for all the wrong reasons. If you want high gain distortion pass this up, otherwise you will submit a report of unsatisfaction. If you want to boost your amp a little without over the top gain look no further. I will also mention that this isn't a cure for lacking tone. You need to establish a decent tone without the pedal first, then the SD-1 will accentuate that. I have tried this pedal on solidstate amps with disappointing results,works best with tube amps, in my opinion anyway.                
Excellent sound. Very useful like smooth overdrive or light distortion. Gives an increase in the medium frequencies. The only drawback of this pedal is that it sucks part of the low end response.
Good if you want to increase the guitar volume for solos.                
Everything you need is there.                
Only 3 knobs...                
BOSS: Best pedal construction.                
Excelent sound for the money.                
Never had to contact BOSS.                
Perfect.                
Excelent.                
It's an overdrive, a good one. Pretty straight-forward, not hard to figure out. Whatever amp your running, this pedal is your upper-cut.                
I originally came into my local music store two/three weeks agolooking for the SD1 - after buying Digitech's Bad Monkey, returning it and finding the SD1 newly in stock, I quickly returned the bad monkey and scooped it up - and how glad was I! The tone is miles ahead of the shrilly digital sound of the Digi overdrive - whereas three simple knobs can make such a difference. It took a few days of tweaking and experimentation, but just recently I dialed in the perfect tone on my Crate Flexwave 120FW - and the sound I get when I stomp the boss is so pleasing I'm scared to touch the solo knobs! Overall, with a little tweaking, this pedal has enough.                
This pedal lacks features for one reason: it doesn't need alot of features to do its job. I didn't find this as a displeasing at all, but rather better. I gave it a 7 as it's not a completely flashy pedal. I don't wish it had anything more.                
With three knobs, how could you go wrong? My justification for buying this pedal was I didn't really want to be swooned to spend $100 dollars on a Tubescreamer when that in itself could buy a new pickup if need be.  For $50 and less in some places (in my case, as it was $45), and with Boss, I knew I had to atleast check it out. All in all, you don't have to be a good guitarist to get any type of moderate distortion you want.                
I love Boss pedals after I first bought the MD2 - which later turned out to be not so amazing after I discovered palm muting sounded awful on it - but after my slight experience with the way it was built like a tank, I expected no less, and no less were my expectations correct. It feels rock solid, the dials have a very unique quality to them, the finish & color is very recognizable (and that's a Boss thing; and I love it), and the sound, last but certainly not least, is better than my amp's overdrive channel in that is sounds very deep, resonant and natural. Suffice to say, it's very pleasing to have the SD1 in my loop.                
I find it extremely - amazingly - worth the price at any retailer. The price I paid was modest and still kept close to the retail value, and I would pay just about anything close if I had to buy it again.                
I have never dealt with Boss at all, but the stamp of approval on its' 5 year warranty on the box practically speaks for itself in matters of support.                
If I didn't have this pedal I would be working myself to death trying to get money for pickups, then I might decide they don't make my guitar sound any better and I go out in search of a pedal, but I can't because I'm broke as I just bought new pickups. Needless to say, I now thrive on this pedal simply because it gave me an amazing shortcut in my tone, altogether with the price I paid for it, I feel like I got my money's worth, and plenty more than that.                 
I have never tried another overdrive (beside the Bad Monkey); and although this is no original vintage TS808 or TS9, I'll give it a 9 because it isn't the best overdrive in the world. If I had to replace it, I wouldn't think of buying anything else unless I had to, and I could afford it. Because It feels like it could withstand nuclear war, this pedal isn't going anywhere out of my possession.                
This pedal sounds amazing. I'm using a crappy little 15w Fender Frontman 15G amp, but I can adjust my SD-1 pedal to get as decent sound as I can from the amp. I have heard this pedal on larger amps, and speaker cabs, and its simply phenomenal!                  
When I bought the pedal it was just the pedal, I had to buy the jumper cables and what not. It came with a 9v battery in it, but the battery didnt have much charge. Once I got the PSA adaptor I didnt have to worry about batteries just yet. 
The pedal is stomp-proof. When I'm shredding, or rocking a rhythm, this box handles my weight at about 200lbs. I would advice standing on the thing, but me stomping on it is quite enough.                
Quite simple. 3 knobs, and a pedal. I whack a chord or a note, and adjust the knobs to get the sound I want. darken the tone and up the drive, or about 50/50 on drive and level and get me a warm sound. 
The pedal came with a very simple instruction manual, and leaves room for exploration. I also forgot to say, since each pedal is color coded, it makes recognizing pedals all the easier. when your in the dark on the stage, or in broad daylight, its simple.                
As I said above, the quality is good, in both sound, and design. The only thing you really have to worry about are the conenctions sticking out of it that you might break.                 
Being priced at a price below 50 US dollars, it was a steal. good sound, for a good price. one of the better pedals for a low price.                 
I havent had to deal with the support yet. Hopefully i wont have to. So far so good.                 
Yellow, stands out, first pedal to stomp, and with the right kind of music, anything can be sexy. its small, and looks like a brick. no gawdy stomp knobs sticking out, and the sound knobs on it already are almost lower than the stomp pedal, so you dont have to worry about steping on one.                 
Nothing beats having an overdriven tube amp, but the Boss SD-1 pedal really makes the sound different, and better. When using a chip amp, it helps drive a cleaner sound.                 
Sounds very cool, but has a little bit to much high frequency                
No support needed. If broken, I'll buy a new one. Cost only $50.00                
A lot of control over the Overdrive... Tone level and drive what more do you need? and the most important part of the sound... its made by BOSS                
Simple and to the point... twist the nob and your set                
Come on? You hit it with yoour Foot and it turns on...                
Its BOSS... Well built, perfect for stage and im in a Punk Band!!!                
I picked it up for 38 Pounds stg and thats a steal $50? thats 25-30 Pounds                
Never Had To Deal Wiith Them...                
Im a fan of BOSS pedals for cosmetics durability reputation and most of all sound...                
Well its an add on not the last piece before success but well it covers youe overdrive i twin it with a custom distortion on a VOX AD30VT i have total Control                
Great Sound.  It can however suck a bit of the lower end.  This pedal has a smooth classic sound.                
Volume Tone Drive.
would be nice if you could boost some of the frequencies (namely the bass.)                
3 knobs, but a lot of combinations for sound.    Quite easy to use.                
I got this pedal used.  And then I beat the crap out of it.  This pedal might be indestructible.                
Great Value                
I haven't dealt with them about this pedal, but I did have ask Roland (Who owns boss) a couple questions about my 20+ year old JC-120 amp.  They got back to me right away.                
Looks like a Boss pedal.   Which if you know boss pedals, you would assume that it's a decent well built pedal.   It's like buying a hammer.  You know it's going to get the job done.                
This pedal has never failed me.  What it does it does well.  It has that classic sound, and can take a beating.  It isn't the right sound for all applications, but it does work for a good many.  I'd rather have this pedal than some others with much higher prices.                
excellent, the idle humming is barley noticebale                
none needed...its a pedal                
3 knobs, could it get easier? pedal goes down easy                
sturdy, everything is great                
cheappppp                
good deal                
everyone should have this, its a good base sound                
This is the best pedal you could ever own. It sounds so good! Put it into a high-powered amp and just let go! I have all the settings on the pedal to about 2 o'clock                
IT doesn't have a lot of features but it doesn't need many its an OVerdrive pedal and it is the best there is.                
It is a boss, it will still be around long after i'm gone.                
Wasn't very expensive at all. The technology isn't cutting edge but it doesn't need to be. This is a brilliant overdrive pedal. It lets you rock HUGE while given a lot of transparency so all the little details of your playing, what makes you, you, is still there. It isn't muddled up by the overdrive.                
never had to deal with them don't know.                
BUY IT! YOU WON"T REGRET IT.                
As i said before brilliant pedal, it wasn't alot of money and it sounds incredible!                
I have used this overdrive pedal for more than twenty years. This pedal allows you to take the original tone with on/off pedal pedal comparisons and increase the gain to the point that your amp will naturally follow.                
3 knobs, that is all. Each one is truly usable.                
Over twenty years of use without a single problem or "scratchy" pot...'nuff said!                
Value!!! I paid more for this pedal ($60 US) in the early 1980's. The industry has certainly changed!                
This pedal has a lot of good settings. If someone does not like this pedal, it is likely that they do not like their original tone. This pedal adds layers of great overdrive.
If you have a weak solid-state "bedroom amp", you may not like this pedal. If you want a distortion pedal that sustains tones for days, this pedal is not for you.
I got lucky over twenty years ago to find a pedal that does not "clamp"(compress) and merely "fuzz" like Electro Harmonix Big Muff, and not add notchy/cheap/feedback riddled tones like other offerings by Boss/MXR/DOD(Digitech).                
This pedal has little is integral of my sound. I use it with my 1974 all-tube Sunn Model T, and a Gibson electric guitar. The tone I shoot for is Black Sabbath/ Corrosion of Conformity/ Black Flag/ Down/ Down II.
I'm a 24 year guitar veteran. I use to gig on a semi-pro level and now I am just a hobbiest.  I was always against any sort of midi / guitar synth system. Then one day I got a wild hair up my arse and decided to buy the Boss SY-300. This is one of the best purchases I ever made! MIND BLOWN!! I liked this so much that not long after I bought this I ended up getting the Boss GP10 and the Roland GR55 guitar synths. These processors hooked up with head phones.....MIND BLOWN!!!!                
This unit is way more convenient than the type that requires a midi cable.  However, the sounds that it can produce are very limited and it does not really work well unless your using a clean channel without any distortion.  I am using a splitter so that the synth is is going to a clean amp with a volume pedal and my other amp has the typical overdrive tones.  This is the only way that I found it usable for playing out in a band.  It adds much texture and fullness but at a steep price,                
Sound was very clear, just not musically useful.                
You can edit, but extremely limited editing. The sounds were all canned and very little manipulation was allowed, so you are stuck with cheesy canned sound effects.                
Extremely limited, very menu intensive, not at all user intuitive.                
Built like the best paper weight ever made.                
It's equivalent to one of those novelty cheesy synth stomp boxes that winds up in a pawn shop for $125                
The company is obviously not going to allow you to have the same sounds on their expensive synthesizers in this box unless they can sell you special pickups and deal with tracking issues.                
Looks great, built a nice looking box, unfortunately it's a way over priced useless box.                
As a typical synthesizer, there are hundreds of patches, most are useful. In this situation, there are hundreds of patches and maybe 1 or 2 were usable. Just a bunch of sound effects you'd find on a movie soundtrack, nothing you could play single note scale or solo unless you just held a chord for 10 seconds waiting for the outcome of your sound. Such a bummer because you don't need a special pickup and there is no tracking issues, just no usable sounds. Epic fail Boss!                
I play mostly "Clean Traditional Jazz Guitar" using Chrome Flat wounds, few effects and seldom utilize distortion. My tone is very jazz box with just a touch of highs on the tone setting. As such, I was looking for a really clean, neutral echo device and found it.The Tera Echo creates beautiful ambient echo which seems to favor no particular frequency. It's just gorgeous and reminds me of a multi-room sized physical tank echo unit I once had the pleasure of experiencing at Sunset Recorders in LA when I was a punk kid during the 1960's. While it's normally very neutral, if I dig in, the unit creates an "after-sound echo" that resembles an explosive digital comb sweeping beautifully through the note or chord I played. Beyond my narrow usage, the I guTE-2 creates a multitude of beautiful effects which ought to turn on the creativity of any Guitar Player. I like it.man                
This thing sets the bar so damn high, that after using it you can’t even see the bottom. It takes you on a journey through time and space. It’s beyond an echo, delay, or reverb. It has a spatial envelope filter, that is unlike anything else. It will make any player sound better.                
Sound is very good overall.  Can get a nice variety of trem rate and depth.  I like the wave shaping also.                  
I like the features overall.  For the $, this seemed to have everything I had a need for.  Some of the Boss pedals aren't worth much, but this is one of their better effects pedals out there.  I'm not afraid to buy expensive gear, but I just couldn't see that much more value in the higher end boutique trem effects pedals.  I guess it's all about the sound you want.  I wanted a pedal version of the old-school vibrato channels on the fenders, and this does the trick nicely for me.                
Very straightforward and easy to use.                
Seems to be very high quality, as all Boss pedals are.  I've had some, under very heavy use, that are 8 years old, and still look barely used.                  
This is a nice value, mid-range tremelo pedal.  You can spend more on Boutique's, but unless you need a very specific sound, I find this pedal gives all most players would need in a tremelo.                  
Never needed to call support.  No issues.                
This is a no-nonsense straightforward tremelo pedal.  You can spend more for fancy looking, but I appreciate the functional layout and design.  Very consistent with all Boss pedals.                
This is a good, solid pedal, and in my opinion, all most players would ever need.                  
Very warm sounding tremolo. Slight volume drop when engaged but, honestly, it's not THAT noticeable.                  
Triange/square wave option is very useful. Depth knob doesn't really come into play until 12:00. Speed range is perfect. Won't go ring mod fast or crazy slow, but a wide enough range for normal use. Not true bypass but the buffer is fine, and sometimes a buffer is useful.                
Easy as pie. Three knobs and a stomp. Dialing in a good sound on this pedal is simple.                 
It's a Boss, it's not going to fall apart on you                
I went through a handful of tremolo pedals, some priced 3x as much as the Boss, but I kept coming back to the TR-2. For a fraction of the cost, it sounds just as sweet as the rest. You can't beat the value.                 
Great tremolo pedal, even better value! Don't over-think it.                 
Forget all the comments about volume drop.  There is no volume drop and this pedal does not color your tone one bit.    I tried a couple of what I call minature novelty pedals and they were more like a volume boost-tone pedal.  I wanted something to dress up my slow ballads and of course "Born On The Bayou".  This is totally transparent sound wise and perfect.  Boss wins again.                
This is the best built, best sounding tremolo for the money... What doesn't work for me is the very small taper area of common rate speeds all within 10 to 2 on the rate control. So many effects today employ a Tap Tempo to achieve the correct speed for a song. Trying to dial these correct tempos in is nearly impossible... Roland Boss fixed the volume drop... Now, they need to spread out the Rate Taper... Then this pedal would be perfect.                
As much as I dig these pedal for what it does and it does sound good when set right,I had to remove it from my pedal board cause it seems to cause my low end all of a sudden disappears. I have eleven Boss pedals and two DC-Brick power supply's and whenever I add the TR-2 my low end disappears. The rest of the Boss pedals have a great buffer except this TR-2. Maybe Boss needs to go back to the drawing board on this particular pedal...                
This is by far the most accurate, easy to use tuner of this side. Even better than ones that cost 3x more!!! Get a couple                
I've used this for both the bass and guitar in live settings and it's done everything I could want it to do.  If you take the time to learn how to switch the modes, there are no issues at all.  I love the mute/gate when it is engaged as I do some bass playing for religious services and it is a great to be able to tune/adjust quickly on the fly.  The LED lights are nice and bright and visible when the stage lighting is bright.  Additionally, I've found the accuracy of the tuning to be spot on.                
Most useful features described above.  However, if you're going to use it alot, get a power adapter.  This thing loves batteries.  But DON'T buy the Boss one.  I bought the "one spot" adapter and it has held up far better with no issues.  Didn't give it a 10 due to the adaptor Boss has and the fact that it loves batteries.                
I read manuals unlike most people.  So if you read the manual, it is SIMPLE to use.  I browsed through the little manual in the box and had it up and running for both guitar and bass and can now change it on the fly.                
Boss - always has rugged dependable stuff.  Their adapters suck though.  Get a 'One Spot'.                
I have a Korg rack tuner for bigger gigs, and I use this for smaller ones.  Well worth the money for the smaller gigs but could be used for large ones as well it that's your preference.                
Never have needed support of any kind.  Says alot about their products if you ask me.                
I've always been partial to the simplicity/look of MXR boxes as the Boss boxes are a bit bigger.  But I have no issues with this one at all.  It has already received its share of nicks and bumps from consistant setup and tear down - that makes it "prettier" in my opinion.                
Overall a 9 - again, hate the adapter, but this product itself is worth every penny.                
Doesn't produce sound. It's a tuner.                
This is amazing! It allows you to tune basses, guitars, everything! In all tunings!                
All you do is plug on end of the cord into you amp, and the other end into the input of the pedal and press down on the pedal and it tunes for you.                
100% awesome.                
I would reccomend this over any other tuner.                
I'm a novice and I previously used a super snark for tuning but since getting the TU-3 it's all I use. very easy to use and accurate, I've even set my intonation by it. The only thing I don't like is when you go sharp, say C sharp, the tiny dot that represents # is hard to see for my old eyes. If you run this on battery be sure to unhook the instrument cable from it when your done or it will eat your battery up by morning. plugging the instrument cable into it is what actually turns it on , not stepping on it. zZounds is quick to ship, love it!                
It's a tuner and isn't supposed to affect the sound.                
Incredibly practical to have highly visible, silent turning available while on stage.                
Easy to turn on and off. One of the visual tuning aid modes is very good, the other less so. I have a feeling they could come up with something a little less busy if they worked on it. It's very clear when the tuning is dead on, sometimes a little less clear as to which way to adjust it.                
Seems very rugged.                
I haven't seen many similar tuners. It's definitely worth the extra money as compared to the Boss non-pedal tuner.                
n/a                
Assuming it doesn't wear out or die prematurely, I would definitely replace it with the same model.                
It doesn't seem to add any noise to the signal, so it's fine to leave it in the effects chain.                
Works great.                  
Easy to use.                
Built like a tank.                
It's worth it, definitely.                
I registered the product at the Roland website.  It was an easy, hassle-free process.                
It's not all that great to look at, but it does what it does so well, aesthetics are irrelevant.                
This is my go-to tuner, for now.  I don't expect that to change any time soon.                
Works as it should. The buffer in it is very good. Gives you consistent tone when ran 1st before all your other pedals, but after a fuzz.                
The different modes for tuning are super useful, and high brightness mode is helpful for bright environments.                
Dirt simple to use                
super well made, bullet proof like all other boss pedals.                
yeah its worth the money, but now in days, you can tune more than one string at once, and other tuners have better displays or more accuracy. But this is one is better for tone and built stronger.                
nope no need to                
I rate it super well. Its improved my tone running it 1st. The buffer is one of the best I've tried,                 
Great tuner. Well built. Great buffer. Consistent tone. Will last a long time.                
I used this tuner for a week now, I really like it. I just can not understand why I am blowing through batteries  so fast. Do I have to unplug the pedal every time I am done with it?  I step on it to turn it off but the next day I go to use it, the battery is dead. these batteries are almost $10 a piece. maybe I am doing something wrong. this is my first pedal. the Pedal Works like a charm it is very accurate.                
I've had it since its first inception in 2010 and am glad I have it on my pedalboard! I bought two of them,one for back up.  I don't care how great of a Guitar/Bass player someone thinks they are,if your not in tune all the time,YOU WILL SUCK! and loose gigs.. I play semi-pro gigs  that pay! and let me tell you they don't have time for mickey mouse teenage guitarist mentality. If you cant tune your guitar fast and deliver the goods that your expected you don't get a call back.....THIS TUNER HAS SAVE ME LOTS OF GOOD GIGS! and the plus side,no tone loose at all.                
Thud! If you drop it, it makes a thud, nut this thing is built to last.                
I really like how of you want to tune your guitar to drop D or anything, it will show you how far you are from it. The little LED lights are spot-on with pitch accuracy.                
Very easy. It's so simple and so effective, best tuner out on the market. Except for maybe Gibson's Min-etune thing.                
It's built like a tank. It's made of metal and pretty darn durable. I dropped it one time, and there wasn't even a scratch!!!                
Well worth the $100. Could be $85, nut I'm kinda cheap. Well worth the money for sure. I entered in everything as 5-stars, but it wouldn't keep them for some reason.                
No, but I'm sure they're pretty Boss-y                
WOW! Its an essential, and I was pretty picky about pedal tuners, since I can't really hear myself on stage or practice. This little thing is really helpful as well as convenient.                
I honestly wasn't expecting much, but when it arrived I quickly changed my mind. It was kind of funny, because when I opened it a few papers flew out of the little box it's in. It sure does it job, very very accurate if you know how to use it!                
The pedal has precise tuning and takes 3 seconds to get up and running. I know many friends who use this pedal and swear by it, which is why I purchased it.I'm Incredibly happy with it and I'm looking forward to having this around for a very long time!                
The inline Boss TU-3 is perfect for outdoor gigs where temperature changes require frequent retuning.  Just step on the pedal, tune offline without disconnecting any cords or turning off the amp, then click again and you're back in business.  It also eliminates amp poping sounds when switching guitars.  The indicator is easy to read from a standing position.                
Works as advertised.  Necessity for ANY pedal board.                
Love the tuner so couldn't bring myself to rate it poorly even though it doen't produce sound.                
Love the Sweep function and the off standard memorization settings. Our Church piano is tuned at 438(!) instead of 440. My other tuner, though capable of setting to 438, it reverts back to standard on power up.                
Lots of features, so it does take some time to get comfortable with the operation.                
Still have a Tu-2 (?). Not even sure how old it is, but it still works fine. Also have several other foot pedals from the company and all still work.                
Great price from Zzounds and this tuner will last forever.                
Though I haven't had to use them. Again can't give them a rating hit because their product performs so well for so long....                
Have a couple tuners, but HAD to have this one for all the features, reliability and ease of use                
Doubt I'll ever need to purchase another tuner unless I get tired of carting this one back and forth.                
By far the best tuner for the money hands down. This pedal is durable, reliable, and always dependable. I have seen way more expensive rack tuners that can't touch this tuner!                
Why in the world would you only have a "sharp" indicator, when almost everyone tunes to "flat"?  Sure, you know that d sharp is the same as e flat, but especially when quickly dropping your low string on a e flat guitar to d flat, who wants to even waste that much attention if you only have a few seconds between songs?  My son plays onstage with four guitars in four different tunings, some to standard and some flat, so using just the "flat mode" is not an option.  Lots of options on this pedal, but I think that's where the problem lies:  it's trying to be all things to all players.  Overall, it tries to do too much at once and wind up doing it's job less well as a result.  Bypass is dead silent, so that's nice.  Power supply would be handy if I didn't already have one.  Overall, underwhelming.  I expected more from Boss.                
No draw on tone that I hear. I believe it is true bypass.                
Use it on anything you'd like.                
Little weird at first but it is a good solid tuner.                
This company (roland/boss/edirol) will be around for a long time.                
It was a a gift. Priceless as they say.                 
Web site is pretty good and has all manuals etc.                
Never used a tuner. I can tune on the fly.
I like the pedal for its approach to visual tuning. Very cool.
So I do use it before playing a set.                
will never own another tuner. still have boss gear from twenty years ago.                
I found this piece to do exactly what I was told it would do. It is easy to install and use with my equipment. It greatly enhanced both my recordings and live performances. Thanks for making it available.
It is amazing to me what one man can produce with an instrument and the right equipment                
Phenomenal.  The vocals are rich and flexible even without pitch correction.  You can push this unit to the extreme and still sound really good.  Bending notes transition smoothly (no chattering effect).  Layering vocal loops does not degrade the previous loops, so you can sing rounds and not lose fidelity.  With a little tweaking, I even made myself sound like an African chorus (I'm Chinese, so this really messes with people)                
Lots of useful features for vocalists.  Easy to read the display in any condition.                  
SO easy to use, yet powerful.  The menu was so easy that I have yet to open the manual.  I knew almost every feature by the time this left the store.  I even trained the sales person on how to use it!                
Built like a brick.  My only concern is missing the pedal in the heat of performance, and snapping off the sound dial, but even that looks like it could take a few good stomps and survive.                
Hard to say.  I've been seeking a vocal pedal that does the things this one does for a couple of years, so to me this thing is an excellent value.  The price is a bit steep, but beats every vocal pedal out there, sooo....                
Don't think I'll need Boss support for this pedal.  Ever.                
It looks like every dual pedal effect Boss makes.  I love that it's not cluttered with lots of buttons and dials.  What I love most about it is the fact that it's EXACTLY what I wanted in a vocal pedal, but no one made it until Boss released this.  Someone at Boss did their research.
(note: at the time I discovered the VE-20, I couldn't afford it but bought it anyway.  I'll just eat lots of Top Ramen this month.)                
I suspect that this pedal will become legendary, like the DS-1.  I hope Boss continues this pedal because it fits live and studio applications very well.  I would definitely replace it if lost/stolen/broken, and hope that I can replace it easily if that happens.                
It doesn't weaken your tone at all when adding effects. If you looking for some good reverb, modulation, and delay this thing does the trick and sounds as good as many $$rack units out there. The double voice effect sounds great for a chorus live.                 
It has a lot of great features but you can't control everything with you feet.                
Really easy to use. Building off the presets is easy. The presets sound pretty good already.                
Boss pedals are always built well.                
Great service and company.                
Sounds as good as many rackmounts that are at least 2x the price.                
Shouldn't have made it like there twin guitar pedals. Boss should have made this a new design with more pedals and an expression pedal for more control in a live situation. But that's the only problem.                
The pedal was even better than I thought it would be. I've been playing for 50yrs and don't impress easily. But WOW, this thing is amazing. As always dealing with Zzounds is the best experience of ALL online music stores. Their 4 pay plan makes it easy as pie to get anything you could want. Thank you fro being who you are                
I rate this item 5 diamonds & 5 stars:  Easy to set up and breakdown.  The menu is simple to use.  I've been doing the gig scene here in the Hawaiian Islands for more than 30 years....the economy kind put all of us entertainers to be 'soloist'....this BOSS VE20 Voice Performer Pedal is so handy and supportive....I don't feel so lonely now when I do my gigs......DonaldKaulia(iTunes)                
The sound of this boss ve-20 is off the hook !!! And the quality, you can beat it. It has a very precise responce, it,s right on the money. The sound OMG it's the bomb! I can achieve whatever sound I could possibly imagine, it,s amazing to say the least. I'm just starting to experiment with it, 'cause I just got it, but OMG I am really blown away! It is on the same level as I am, it's a goes-with type of box. It does what you program it to do, and the sound by it self, bud, it's unbelieveable. It really sounds great with other products. And for recording live, the sound is quality,quality,qaulity. In the setting department, the sky is the limit. I'm using this pedal with my Behringer and Peavey mixers combined and getting the max out of it! The sound I my environment is absolutely a 10! If I could change anything it would be the way the harmonies sound, but it's steal the absolute BOMB!                 
This pedal did come with the adapter and six batteries so it's on! Ready to rock your world, as they say.  I'm steal experimenting with the pedal so I'm really ready to commint on the least and any features I wish it had, but maybe later on I could comment in that area. This pedal is made of quality materials and it looks like it could last a life time and the components are tight and just what this box needs.                
It'pretty easy to get the sounds you want, I mean, you have to go through all the setting, but this gives you a lot of options as to what you want to hear as you sing and play. I've not used this with interface, so I'm not able to comment in this area. It's pretty easy to use once you get acquainted with it. There is definitely a learning curve, the manuel does help in assitting one's path. Have not tried it on any instruments so cannot comment in that area.                 
This product is very durable, in my opinon, I think it could last a lifetime. the quality and the cosmetic of this product is top notch. I've only had it one month and so far, it's always functioned each time I've hit the on buttom...I have no backup, but I really don't think I will need one (backup). This product will be great for the road. It could very well last a decade or more.                
Yes                
I gave this a 7 because I do not know what the company would do should I need their assistance...                
This product is COOL,COOL,COOL! This is a great addtion to my instrument arsenal.                
I suspect that I will be satisfied for a good minute with this product. This product does meet my goals and then some. If it were stolen I would have to purchase another one,(the same VE-20) already, I am very attached to this pedal. Before I bought this product I wish I had known how much I needed something like this. I really like the many things this unit can do, and make my songs go to a higher level as far as quality.                 
I am a Drummer and I've wanted a hands free harmonizer for a long timeI started using the unit straight out of the box. It's very simple to operate. The menus are easy to navigate and the manual is an easy read. I had distortion when I first fired up the unit but after I turned down the Master level and the Mike Sensitivity it was fine. The WOW factor is the combination of things this unit can do. It's an effects unit, a vocoder, a looper ect... if you bought all of these as separate units you would spend a lot more than the asking price of the VE20. Also, the sound quality is wonderful.On the down side I find that the unit is a bit awkward to use as a floor unit since you have to make menu adjustments by hand. I have mine setting on a music stand on my left side and run it by hand.All in all the Boss VE20 is a very well constructed quality unit and a great value. Buy it.                
This compact pedal delivers believable harmonies, nice reverbs and clear delays.  I tested everything out there and nothing this small delivers so much and you don't have to play instrument although I do. I have a small rack of effects (Lexicon, TC Electronic, Aphex Aural Exciter and Tube preamps).  I don't cart the rack to gigs anymore.  I can reasonably achieve those studio effects and carry in my gig bag.  Boss got it right.                 
No accessories.  It should have included the PSA power adaptor for $250, but I went ahead and got one separately. I believe the presets are good and a real joy of this box is the ability to tweak delay times, feedback, the dynamics, 5 or so reverbs and stacking harmonies. However, the phrase looper and the ability to overdub is remarkable.                 
Good manual but I just opened and started testing.                 
Made of metal...should withstand gig abuse for many years.                 
I would have paid a bit more now that I've tested it.  Again, it should come with a power supply.                
Haven't needed.                
I saw this on a You Tube video featuring Alexx Daye and had to have one.                 
This is going to be in my arsenal for a long while. The first gig I used it on...people took notice of the harmonies coming from just ME!!!                
Yep before I got committed to the boss I checked out the tc Helicon and all the others as well and now that I own the boss and have had a chance to use it for a couple months I am so very glad I did.1. Don't need an instrument to "trigger" the key your back ups are singing in.2. Very programable without a big investment in time to set up your patches your way.3. The vocal quality is pristine in your lead effects and your back ups.4. The transition while your backups follow u is flawless, no hiccups or stutters.5. Once you get a couple of customized patches you like programmed close to each other the foot switches work quietly and flawlessly to move between patches.6. The whole manual (in english) is about 15 pages and is strait forward and easy to understand.Boss got this one right, my guess is that this one will be a classic amongst pedals.Honestly I use only a couple of patches most of the time and the sound (as long as your voice is right on and in key) is like cd quality. If your looking for a way to improve your show quality,Â  specifically in the vocal dept. then this is the only one to buy.                
This processor is definitely one of the better vocal processorsnon the market, especially for the price! I have also owned the Digitech 300 and the Boss blows it away. The preprogrammed effects are very useful and stageready and the sound quality is phenomenol!                
I play professional  so you would not believe how much this helps my voice! amazing. It would be nice if the power cord came with it , but It's great anyway .                 
Simplicity in a duel pedal box... no need to call NASA....or get a grad from MIT to help ya out witth this...the manual is simple the layout,design,functions are simple yet tough.
I use this ( borrowed) and digitech300/400 vox system-both are rugged,simple but this is the BOSS....ya can't/won't sound fake... nuff said !                
I like the way it works and sounds.                
after speaking with a customer service person who checked it out for me, found out you could use it with a separate send from the mixer board, you can send any one person to the unit by changing the sends, me vocals ,you thru unit for back ups, you lead vocal me backups changing sends on board, inexpensive answer to better vocal sounds                
DON'T KNOW WHY I WAITED SO LONG. THIS IS THE BEST PIECE OF EQUIPMENT I OWN.  THE VE20 HAS CHANGED HOW THE WHOLE BAND PLAYS AND HAS PUSHED MY VOCALS TO PLACES I HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO TRY. IT IS TOTALLY AMAZING AND I STILL HAVE NOT CHECKED OUT ALL THE FEATURES...   I LOVE IT ..... TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT..                
Comparable to rack units in terms of sound. 30 well selected presets that can be modified into 30 user banks. I'm a sax player that wanted to have a good sounding verb and delay no matter where I went or what system I was plugged into. This met that need. I also used the octaves, harmonizer, and chorus to fatten up parts. I like that the second pedal is assignable so that I could keep my reverb delay settings and kick in the doubling and harmonizing as needed. This product was very quiet as compared to the TC Helicon Create pedal that I used. Each serve different functions but I found the boss pedal to be far more flexable and the sound much cleaner.                
It had the feature set that I needed. I would have liked a few more parameters to tweek but after all this is a stomp box and not a studio verb unit. While on the subject of studio, I would not hesitate to use it for session work.                 
The box is layed out logically and five minutes with the instruction booklet had me up and running. I was able to program in 10 user patches in the first hour I had the box and I played my first gig with the box that night. Six of the ten patches I programmed in were keepers and I actually fine tuned the sounds on break and was able to dial in what I was wanting. Great that those parameters can be named, copied, swapped, and stored.                
The product is the same construction as Boss's other twin pedals.                
I think the pedal is a bargain.                
No opinion                
Not much on sex appeal for stomp boxes. It simply works as advertised.                
This pedal will be used for many years to come.                
I bought it as a gift for my daughter in California and it arrived just in time for Christmas! Thanks zZounds! She lives it!                
When you add up everything this pedal offers, tuner, guitar fx, deep vocal fx, a mixer and a looper, you can't come close to replicating all of that with separate pedals, for even twice the price! The audio quality is superb.                 
I've been using the Boss VE8 for about 2 months and it has replaced my TC Helicon Mic Mechanic 2 and TC BodyRez (for busking) and in doing so, I've added a looper and harmonies! Comparing the vocal and guitar FX between the Boss and TC gear...they're different, but neither is necessarily better than the other. (For reference I also have a TCH VoiceLive 2). To my ears, the harmonies on the Boss unit seem to have more of a "live" sound, like when you hear a recording of a live concert on the radio, whereas the TCH gear has a more polished studio vibe to it. Sometimes the TCH VL2 can come off as a little overdone for a solo/duo acoustic show, but is great with the band. When it comes to the Boss guitar "Resonance" feature, it's good. Very good, but I slightly prefer the BodyRez for tone, but the Boss for convenience. (The BodyRez had to be powered by a Volto 2)
I bought this primarily because it is battery powered. I'm using the VE8 with a TC Helicon MP70 mic and Line6 G30 wireless system (Powered by a Volto 2), running into a Roland Street Cube EX (also battery powered) for busking, outdoor weddings, parties and camping. It's a great rig! I can carry it all in one trip. However for "stage gigs" I'll still use my TC gear.                
This pedal is amazingly versatile with a built in two track mixer and looper, and a bunch of really excellent effects for vocals and guitar, or any line input. When I think of what simple BOUTIQUE PEDALS GO FOR, THIS A STEAL!                
This is a very cool and useful tool for any solo musician, I only wish it had some compression in it.The harmony portion is a 5 star however in my personal opinion. I would highly recommend this Boss product to any soloist. All though it does not have a compression button it still holds it's own with any other or all solo/acoustic devices.                
Boss has a real winner here. you get a real talk box sound without the tube in your mouth and you get 2 vocoder sounds and a choir like sound. you can also blend your guitar or bass with these effects. It sounds very good with the guitar and excellent with the bass in my opinion                 
A little harder to use as a talk box then an actual talk box, but a simpler set up and no nasty hose.                 
I bought this for a traveling option and easy and carefree wireless option. It is easy to charge and comes with a cable to charge either or both the receiver and transmitter if you dock the transmitter in to the receiver. You can charge both independently if you have another USB mini cable. I get a good amount of use and can easily last a whole 4-5 hours. I like that it fits in my case easily and can be charged with a Mobile battery pack while I am at the gig while in my case. Sound is good and the range is great, about 30 feet is all I have really tried it may go more, but that is enough to move around when playing without the hassle of a cable trip or Jack Snap. I am 3-4 Months using it and am very pleased so far CJWII                
NO BATTERY REPLACEMENT
The unit itself is OK and a convenient size however, after contacting Boss a few times they finally admitted the batteries are NOT replaceable and don't know the battery life would be they emailed me back and said I quote:
"The WL-20 Manufacturer Warranty is for 1 Year Parts 90 Days Labor.
If you have an issue with the WL-20 Battery within Manufacturer Warranty Terms then it can be serviced/replaced by our Roland Boss Factory Service Department.
We unfortunately can't provide you with the information regarding how long the unit will last this may change and may differ depending on usage."
In my internet research I found this information again I quote:
"The typical estimated life of a Lithium-Ion battery is about two to three years or 300 to 500 charge cycles, whichever occurs first. One charge cycle is a period of use from fully charged, to fully discharged, and fully recharged again."
Also I quote:
"If the voltage of a lithium-ion cell drops below a certain level, it's ruined. Lithium-ion batteries age. They only last two to three years, even if they are sitting on a shelf unused. So do not "avoid using" the battery with the thought that the battery pack will last five years".
This means when the WL-20 won't hold a charge anymore after the warranty period you have buy a new one. These are one shot devices and I am disappointed at this. I might try to return it and continue to use my current wireless. With replaceable batteries.
Mine was delivered today, and what a difference in sound quality and playability vs the basic Fender it replaced.  Breedlove quality at an affordable price.                  
THE GOOD:This guitar arrived on time and packaged properly. The guitar is visually flawless. The neck is straight. The fret ends are perfect.The on board electronics work as expected. THE UGLY:The nut slots were not filed properly resulting in very tight binding on the G, B & high E strings. The truss rod nut was loose, requiring 3 full rotations to engage the rod. The bridge saddle was extremely HIGH requiring substantial sanding to be able to set up a low action. The gig bag is not sufficient to provide the protection necessary for a $400 investment. Order a hardshell case with this guitar! After setting up I have found this axe to be a great sounding and playing instrument.5 stars for build quality. 1 star for factory setup.3 stars for QC at shipping stage.                
Once again, you folks at zZounds have come through, just as you have before for me. Not a mark on my new Breedlove Discovery and once tuned, it's a pleasure to play. Great tone, but better strings will only improve that! Thanks for the great service and I look forward to doing more business with y'all in the future!!!!!                
As a satisfied owner of an 11 year old Korean-Made Breedlove Atlas AC25/SR Plus (still going strong!), I was already leaning towards Breedlove for my first high-end American Made acoustic. However, I spent time playing Taylor 4 and 5 series, Martin 16s and 18s of various shapes and Gibson J45 and AG Hummingbird because I wanted to make sure my bias didn't prevent me from getting the best guitar for my money.After playing over 10 other great guitars, I still came back to the Breedlove for its sound, tonal range, comfortable neck and the beautiful look of natural Myrtlewood grain. Every time I strum, the guitar sings with a resonance and sustain I just don't hear from the other models mentioned. And this neck is sooo easy to play. For comparison, it reminds me of a Taylor 6 or 714, but for $1200 less of course. Quality: Fantastic, out of the box the action was absolutely perfect, fit and finish flawless. I went over this thing with a fine-tooth comb and can't find anything to complain about.Playability: Breedlove is known for super comfortable satin necks, and this one is no different. It plays like butter. The concerto shape is just as comfortable as a concert body.Features: It comes with the soundhole-mounted LR Baggs EAC VTC pickup, sounds very natural plugged in. But, I miss the built in tuner featured on Fishman Pickup systems and I can't see what my volume or tone is set to at any given time. I'll surely live, but as someone who does gig once a week i miss the convenience.Sound: Play it if you ever come across one, the concerto shape truly changes the game. It'll out perform any other acoustic in the price range.Materials: Love the myrtle wood, it's just plain gorgeous. Be careful though because the grain of every top will look different. Luckily if you buy from zZounds you will see hi-res pictures of the exact guitar you're buying, can't say that about other retailers. Ebony bridge and fretboard, tusk nut, hard rock maple neck, great tuners. It's well appointed for sure.TLDR: Buy it!                
First off, I live in a small enough town, so small that there is no music store around. So, I have bought all 4 of my guitars from zZounds online. And actually, I've bought 5 but returned one of them, which was an easy-peazy process with zZounds. That said, I thoroughly research each instrument, read tons of reviews, watch a couple dozen YouTube video reviews, and talk to other musicians before I purchase a guitar. 
This is my first Breedlove purchase and I'm quite sure that it won't be my last. This guitar is AWESOME. I don't know how else to say it, just simply awesome. The Oregon series guitars are just what everyone said they were, great guitars. I got the Whiskey Burst version and it looks incredible. The glossy Solid Sitka Spruce top with the burnt edge really sets this instrument off and could double as a piece of artwork in your living room, cave, or studio. That would be a waste though, this guitar wants to be played. It sounds louder than I expected from a concert series model and has more bass than I expected as well. The tones ring out through the sound hole crisply and sustain quite well. It has an 1 3/4" nut width which makes it easier to play for somebody (like me) that has plumper fingers. And it is easy to play, very easy to play. 
The top is solid Sitka Spruce, and solid Myrtle wood back and sides. The Myrtle is satin finish and it looks good and should season well over the years. The back of the neck is beautifully done in a satin hard maple and feels perfect to my hand as I play. I've played it plugged in and it sounds pretty dang good then too. 
The only downside I would say about this guitar is that when you get down to finger picking frets 15-20 the sound seems to diminish some. But it is an acoustic guitar and most of the time I live above 12 so it isn't really a big deal, just an observation. 
One more thing I should add is that the Oregon Concert Acoustic won the 23rd Annual MMR Dealers Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year in 2015. So, I'm not alone when I think that this guitar is fantastic.                 
This is an awesome instrument! Fun and Pleasurable to play, easy fretboard and neck navigation, beautiful looking, right sized for comfort, What can I say, it is near perfect!!                
A mid-range heavy sound with the factory strings. 80/20's feel much more suitable for this guitar. Lots of tone and sound, although because it's a concert body, it's not gonna be as loud as a dreadnought or jumbo.                
Very simple electronic system that has two dials, one for tone and one for volume. No battery changes needed, and the guitar cable plugs into the bottom strap button.                
Plays nicely. Very comfortable guitar to play.                
Fantastic quality. Guitar case that comes with it is all black on the inside(velvet) and outside.                
I haven't tried the Taylor 312, but this guitar stands up on its own pretty well. I managed to get mine for a good price though, when Breedlove discounted these guitars to accommodate new limited edition versions of these guitars.                 
N/A                
It's just a great guitar.                
Before getting this guitar, I was originally looking at Taylor's 312ce's and 214ce's, until I found this guitar, which had everything I wanted (concert body, electric, non-gloss sides and back). I was a bit skeptical because Breedlove's aren't as popular or reviewed a whole lot, but I figured I would give this a guitar a chance.
Overall, this guitar sounds and looks fantastic! Tone wise with the factory strings (phosphor bronze), it sounds very mid-range heavy, giving the guitar a warm, mellow-ish sound to it. With 80/20's though, the guitar brightens up a lot more, and is definitely my choice of strings. I managed to get a great deal for my Breedlove, and don't regret it one bit!                
This is one fine Breedlove guitar. Balance, tone, playability & looks are all exceptional. Breedlove's customer service is as fantastic as the outstanding guitars they craft. Do yourself a favor & buy one. You will be pleased! Overall rating is a 5!                  
this is 1 of the finest acoustic guitars on the market in some way it reminds me of my old guild acoustic that were made in nj. I am not here to sell you but if you try it you will buy it period. wise decision  friends.                
I received this guitar as a military retirement gift from my wife. It has great clarity when plugged in and sounds boomier than it appears, whether plugged in or not. Overall, I'm super satisfied with my new guitar, which looks great as well.                
Wow, is just what I say about this guitar. Truth is I've owned many many very nice guitars & this is the one that I'm going to keep. Why? The uniqueness, complexity, clarity & projection of sound from this guitar is amazing. The balance is wonderful, the sustain is exceptional, just rings forever and the bass is loud and clear without being to boomy. Love the 1 3/4 nut width. Overall, it feels like this instrument should be $ 3k +.                 
The Breedlove Oregon Concert guitar is the easiest playing and best sounding acoustic guitar I have ever owned. It sounded great the day it arrived and it continues to sound great. It stays in tune. The action is perfect and the sound is everything I could want (considering that this is a concert size guitar and not a dread nought). The only complaint I have is the same one I would have with any acoustic guitar that has a piezo pickup. When you play with an aggressive picking style it can sound a bit quacky. If, however, you use a condenser mic, the sound on this guitar is great. I could not recommend it any higher.                
I received this guitar yesterday in a lefty model. It's a very sleek looking guitar in that it has old world style mixed with some newer designs like the string thru bridge system and the body cut away. Nicely built and finished. I will say I gave it a low score for it's features meaning the electronics. All the online demo's I have seen show this with a Fishman style system, accessible battery compartment, USB out, 3 band EQ and an onboard tuner. It has none of that. They replaced the Fishman with this LR Baggs EAS piezo which gives you an input jack/strap button, a single volume control inside the soundhole and the 9v battery pack velcro'd inside of the soundhole as well so you have to relieve the string tension to get your hand in to it to change your battery. I am going to keep it but purchased this party because of the online videos I had seen with the Fishman system. It does say what type of electronics it has but I had assumed it was simply just another manufacturers take on the same thing to save Breedlove some money maybe? Well they definitely saved money on this new system. All in all it plays well, stays in tune and is fairly well intonated right out of the box. I'd recommend this to anyone of many playing levels as long as you dont mind the annoying battery change issue. For beginners this might be a problem when tuning a guitar is sometimes a major accomplishment then having to untune it because you forgot to unplug it one night and it drained your battery. That is up to you.                
I bought this guitar a few months ago because I had been craving an all-mahogany Parlor for a while now. To say I wasn't dissapointed is an under statement. This guitar is a tone machine and the balance between the treble and bass is very good. The sound is also very warm for a parlor. In addition, the electronics are excellent, with plenty of room for tone shaping. Plus I was very happy with the usb port and the included padded gig bag. Thank you zZounds and Breedlove for once again going above and beyond!                
This purchase resulted from a purchase of another 6 string acoustic from zZounds prior to ordering this Breedlove stage all mahogany guitar. I first ordered another brand and although the guitar was very nice and had a good sound, the on-board tuner stopped working within 30 days of its purchase. I contacted zZounds and with the help of the staff, it was a super breeze to return it. I was going to just get an exchange for the same guitar, but went exploring (as we all do :-)!) on the zZounds website.
This is where I spotted and started investigating Breedlove guitars. The more I learned about how this small company in Bend, Oregon went about their philosophy, innovative designs, and total care and commitment to the quality they demand from their staff to make sure we get a great instrument, I was SOLD! I even phoned them and talked with a really nice lady for about 20 minutes with questions I had. She was most helpful and totally in love with her job!
Now ... on to the review. The very first thing I noticed about Breedlove products when I started unboxing my new toy :-) was the Deluxe Gig Bag. This thing is built like a tank!  All kinds of pockets, padding, backpack straps and handles. What a smart way to safely package your guitar for shipping and give you travel-ready protection for your investment! Nice job!
First ... the innovations of this guitar: Pinless bridge, gradiated thickness of the soundboard (top), headstock design to keep the strings straight from the nut to the machine heads, very nice "flying wings" abalone fretboard markers and abalone inlays with outer rings around the soundhole, the Breedlove Bridge Truss System, beautifully book-matched mahogany grain tone woods with tortoise shell binding and 18 to 1 ratio sealed "Breedlove" chrome tuners.
Next ... the fit and finish. This guitar has a very soft satin finish to the all-solid mahogany body. Although high gloss has its charms, I much prefer this finish. No fingerprints :-)!  I closely inspected every aspect of my new guitar and found absolutely nothing wrong with it ... and I''m picky!
Next ... the body type. This is a "concert" body size and shape. I've always been a "dreadnought" guitar player primarily due to the depth of sound a dreadnought produces. I was a little leary of getting this smaller body, but was bowled over by the sounds I heard on the u tube videos, so I took a chance .. and am very grateful I did!
Next ... the sound! This what it finally comes down to! I cannot begin to describe the amazing, pure, quality sound this guitar has! I've gone to the local "national" brick and mortar guitar shops to "test drive" different brands, and there are many fine sounding guitars to choose from ... but NOT at this price point! I played Martins, Guilds, Gibsons, and other comparative axes, but with me choosing this Breedlove model, I ended up with about $1500 - $1700 change. That's no small change!
Next ... The RL Baggs electronic pick up system. This is a quality "clean" sounding pick up. It is simple in design and transfers the wonderful tones my guitar produces in a very neutral and pristine fashion, it simply performs as a quality pick up should. The volume and tone controls are inside the soundhole. This keeps the luthier from having to cut a BIG rectangle hole in the side of the body of your guitar!
Finally ... I done good :-)! For $800 bucks, I feel that I got a $2500 guitar. All my music friends who test drive my new acquisition are literally blown away by its playabilty, its response, and, of course, the sound! I am a happy camper :-)!
Haven't needed to contact Breedlove.                
I absolutely love this guitar. I received it within 2 days as promised in perfect shape and action close to perfect for my style which is mainly fingerpicking. I prefer lighter strings and always replace those that come with a new guitar. This guitar keeps almost perfect tuning, and sounds great, even overnight or after hard use. I believe it to be worth at least twice as much. Only thing I need to mention - the photos on zZounds show this guitar with a natural finish, but mine has a gloss body and satin finished neck. It is still gorgeous, even better, but I just thought you might want to be prepared.                
It produces great sounds due to the solid tone wood.                
Top notch acoustic guitar. While I'm sure the Oregon made guitars are even nicer Breedlove has a quality guitar here and I love it.                
Will need a better setup by that's an individual preference. Plays well out of the box but there's a little room for tweaks.                
Seems like a solid guitar well made and fun to play                
It's a good value                
Did not need to contact                
Has a unique shape and fit n finish is superb                
Just got this guitar today and it's an amazing value. Sounds beautiful and looks beautiful too. The neck is very comfortable. Came almost perfectly in tune in a heavy duty gig bag. Thanks to zZounds I got it fast with 12 payments.                
Great cab not just a bargin, run mine off a bandit you can get anything out of it superclean, or thick distortion can't believe the price                
It is what it is... Works for me for home practice and sound Good enough for that.
Nice looking Cabinet.                
This Thing is a Beast!!I bought this amp as a back-up. Normally play a modded Sovtek mig 60+ a Plexi reissue. the sovtek was in the shop. So I read the reviews on the Bugera 1960 infinium & figured it was worth it just because I could switch the tubes around w/o biasinig. Boy was I right. It came in & I was shocked at how it sounded out of box. Loud & proud. It sounded alot like my plexi. It's not as complex as the plexi but, it's only 1/4 of the price!! Then I changed out the tubes(Pre:1 mullard & 2 E-harm 12ax7) & one power amp( svetlana el34) & the Amp Just came to life!! Smooth but with just enough bite, full but not to bassy. very well rounded in general.This amp has quite a bite of gain. At first I put all 3 e-harm 12ax7 in and it was to much gain for my use. So, the addtion of the mullard in the # 1 position & that tamed the overall sound. Bottom Line..Best value on the market today. If you are willing to do the work & change around the tubes(the best part). You can really bring it life!!                
The tone is incredible with a very smooth and deep breakup.  Excellent Rock and Metal sounds as well as Fusion or Instrumental.  The EQ settings are sensitive and true to the settings on the knob.  I would recommend tyring different tubes in place of the EL34s.  Don't get me wrong but the EL34's sound great.  6L6s have a more "open" sound to them when used with this amp.  it is just cool that you can drop in pretty much any tube.                
Standard number of features but the Infinium technology is incredible.  Plus, you can exchange types of tubes and you will get some variability in sound - TREMENDOUS spec!  No reverb but nothing a pedal can't handle.  I would also like a presence but many older "styles" of amps didn't have presence back then and this is what this amp is modelled after.                
Easy to use as the controls are typical.  The inputs are labeled as well.                
This is a quality made product that can compete on every level of construction. Even seems to use heavy hardwood - very solid.  Parts and wiring seem to be top notch compared to other heads I have.  Looks very "clean".  Only had it for a couple of weeks but so far so good.                
Great value in a 150 watt head with great tone.  This is a TONE MONSTER!  At $500, this is a steal versus the amp this is modelled after which costs 3-4 times this price - and that's a "re-issue"!  This is very gig-worthy and can be compared to the best brands out there for sound and tone.                
N/A                
The Infinium version of the 1960 is tremendous with the Red front insert, it sets itself apart from the rest as far as looks.                
Great value, great price point, great tone and should be bought by every serious musician.  If you don't like it, return it.  $500 is well worth buying for any amp head just to try out.  The Bugera 1960 Infinium is one of the best amp deals out there!                
I owned the first 1960 Bugera model and had to use a power brake to play at normal volume levels...The volume was just too loud in that amp.
When Bugera redesigned the 1960 and may have corrected issues people like me had after owning it.
Problems solved with the NEW model...They added great feature like a phase invertor that acts like a master volume but it actually never cuts the volume completely off rather it will drop the volume down to sound like a 5 watt amp.
The cascaded mod is very interesting. A amp company did this to Rhandy's amp because he wanted more gain in his amp. It works just like that.
The cascade mod uses the second channel as a main gain and the first adds girth. 
It's opposite to the how the first channel now works adding an internal jump to both.
No need for a jump cable anymore to blend volumes, its already been done internally.
This amp is a great bargain for what you get...It's not point to point wiring but the fact that they now include a self bias circuit with their infinium system which tells you when a power tube is bad is worth buying.
This is testimonial the Infinium system works...I bought four EL34 replacement tubes and one turned out to be bad...I had two 6L6GC laying around so I tried two new EL34 and two 6L6GC tubes...
The light went off indicating the tubes all worked and the amp sounds excellent...Yes you can blend tubes in this amp it works...
You can get any sound out of this amp. From Blackface cleans, to Van Halen. For the latter, you need an attenuator. It's difficult to put in words how loud this amp is.                 
The internal channel jumping, and Rhandy Rhoads mod, are great. Effects loop is clutch(it sounds even better with an EQ in the effects loop).
You need to dial a bit of Ch 1 in with Ch 2 to get some sparkle in your clean sound. The presence control is extremely responsive. Be easy with it. The Treble, mid, and bass.... Not so much, but if you have ever played a Plexi, that's how it is.                 
You need to read, watch YouTube, whatever, and understand the four inputs. Also understand that this is a little different from a typical Plexi. The jumpering is done internally. Read the instructions.
Also, you have to turn the effects loop on, and select the right setting for pedals, or for rack effects. The master volume has to be turned on or off.... Leave it off.
The auto bias system is awesome. You can put any tubes that will fit in the amp.                 
I haven't had any trouble with my other Bugera amp.                 
Value is awesome. Hard to believe that you get this much amp for $399.                
I have dealt with them, asking about tubes. They are very helpful.                 
Everyone is shocked at how good this sounds.                 
I have this amp running through Greenbacks. I'm a Strat player. Everyone knows how great these things sound dimed. If you crank these, they will perfectly emulate Van Halen tones. As you turn it down, you get 80's rock, down to AC/DC, Zeppelin, etc.
What I'm doing at the moment is playing with the volume down a bit. I'm using the channels in parallel. I have ch 2 on about 2, and Ch 1 just barely on to where it gives it some high end. It has a beautiful clean tone(at 2, it's band volume). It sounds very much like a Blackface Twin. It's just very sparkly.
However you use them, these amps sound great. It's insane tone for the money. I cannot recommend them enough. I also have the 1990, and it's awesome, as well. If you are wanting a 4 hole 'Plexi' amp, then just get the 1960. It nails it. It will scratch that itch.
The effects loop works great. The Rhoads mod is great, also. You don't have to jump the channels, it's done for you. Only thing is, if you want the Plexi overdrive, Van Halen, etc., you need an attenuator, or some kind of reactive load. It's insanely loud. The master volume in the back just doesn't sound right. It takes the power tube distortion out of the equation. Don't plan on using it. Bugera makes an attenuator for cheap. Go ahead and get it.                 
I have to say this head has by far surpassed all of my expectations!!! From the way it looks to the way it sounds is just so amazing!! And the service here at Zzounds is so Awesome!! Love doing business with Zzounds!!                
So I've own this amp for a month now and put 10 hrs or so on it and I must say this amp is impressive. I've always wanted that Marshall Plexi all tube sound and this is it. Now this amp doesn't have the nicest finish. But its whats in side that counts on this amp. The material that covers the out side is poorly fitted on the corners of the amp. The logos/badges on the other hand look great. Knobs and switches feel nice and firm. So if you don't care about looks but you do care about performance/sound this is it. I can pull Hendrix, Stevie , Page and Gilmore with this amp and some peddles easy.  The head room is amazing. It goes from loud to stupid real fast. The FX loop has a bypass and a db boost too along with a master volume on the back . These are just a few of the things I like about there's plenty of more nice touches on this amp. All in all Bugera has made a nice amp here. I was on the fence for 2 weeks before I order this amp. I was holding out for a Marshall or  Fender but I count see spending $1500 + on a Marshall or $1000 for a 25w Fender that I will take it out to play it and it get beat up while moving it.                 
I recently sold all of my gear due to financial problems.  All I ever wanted was an Amp that had that Plexi sound.  I was doing research on amps when I saw on youtube this Bugera amp.  Needless to say I was hooked!  Amazing Tone no need for pedals and perfect for my budget.                  
Firstly, I've owned at least one of every higher end tube amp at one time or another... there were some that were great, others so so, and most not so great IMO. I've had plexi's from many years, JMP's,  JCM800's, etc.  My most beloved was a 1982 JCM 800 2204 50w.  Well, it got stolen, and shortly after I took a 5 year hiatus from music. Fast forward to now... I got back into the game and needed an amp just to mess around with, well for the price I figured I couldn't go wrong here, so I got the 1960.
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!
I simply cannot believe this thing cost 400 bucks.  It sounds just like many of the old plexi's I had. 
I was searching reviews trying to figure out what amount of gain this thing was capable of and was unsuccessful, so here you go... With the cascaded gain and master volume, it can get up to a 2204/2203 JCM800 with a clean boost turned wide open in front of it... which is pretty gainy.  Beautiful, actually.... it just SINGS. I have an eleven rack that I run straight into the FX loop for high gain stuff IT CRUSHES.  Better than any bogner or recto I've had, in my opinion of course... just because the tweaking of the 11r is endless.
I can't say enough good things about it really... I've tried a few other high gain bugera's  and was just not that impressed... I guess tube high gain is just too hard for them to copy... 
If you're on the fence on the 1960... don't be.                
This a great amp very simple controls how I like them to be.This sucker is loud Reallly loud but keeps it's tone quality at higher volume. The head is actually bigger than it looks in the picture the same size as the old marshall plexi. This amp is a steal the master volume in the back helps a ton but it can still be louder great lows crisp high it's a very versatile amp for volume and genre style not sure for the heavier gain                
I originally use Line 6 equipment because of flexibility along with extensive effects, sound quality yet wanted a pure tube power amp for the vintage tone. My research was extensive and price didn't really play a role, I was prepared to spend as much as was needed to satisfy my tone habit, my addiction. Power, Vintage, Plexi, and British tone all played a role in my choice, almost purchased a 1959 reissue but decided this amp had what I needed. Out of the box and with a guitar with SD vintage pickups I was awed by the clear crisp tones I was hearing, I had planned to hear a warmer sound by other reviews but with this amp the clear tones can be brought to match the bell like cleans of the Vox yet the heavy compressed lows that are felt with any Marshall around! Not bad because I thought I would also be a Vox NT50 head to get those bell like cleans, no need this amp right out of the box does it all, a true Plexi. I ordered extra power JJ tubes for experimentation along with a set of ECC83 that are known to give more breakup crunch or gain, so according to some mixing the EL83's with 6L6's is  better set up but not seeing it myself unless I use my active pickups. To conclude, I have to say overall I'm not sure why you would spend a lot for a plexi style amp when its a "Bugera 1960 Infinium"  that satisfies the addiction! Yes, I am a tone addict!                
I got it delivered yesterday and i haven't stopped yet. All the sound i ever wanted in one amp..                  
I bought  this amp from zZounds, they seem to be the only one to actually carry this excelent sounding amp. I really like the tone in this amp but I wanted to try mix matching 6L6 and EL34 tubes at the same time. This amp allows for cross pollination of tubes and sounds amazing doing this. I am very happy with the tone out of the box but ecstatic that this amp offers so much for under $500.
Check out my demo on YouTube JBM8863 see and listen to my full reviews playing through this excelent amp.                
Better than all the Marshall amps and features it was designed to imitate. Simply Brilliant. And the ability to mix and match tubes takes this amp to a whole new sonic dimension and level of sound tuning. Don't miss this amp!                
Wow, this amps held up great. Waited for a few months to write a review so I could be 100 percent sure I liked it as much as I thought I did when I first unboxed it. I can assure you I do! Wasn't expecting much considering the price, but this thing can easily keep up with a 70s Marshall JMP right out of the box. The one and only issue I've had with this amp is the preamp tubes going microphonic, as expected because I run this thing on 10. Replacing the stock tubes with higher quality just made this amp impress me even more. I still haven't replaced the power tubes, the infium system works.                
Ordered this from zZounds and within an hour of powering it on for the first time, it developed a fizzy sound with no response from the tone controls and then the power tubes starting red plating. Took it to an amp tech who diagnosed it as a faulty power transformer. This was on a brand new amp. Even more frustrating, zZounds charged me for the return shipping on this turd. That will be last dime I spend at zZounds and I'll never buy another Bugera product.                 
This amp can do anything you want it to.
First, the clean channel: I was very surprised at how good the clean channel is on this head. Plug in a Strat, and it's beautiful. Really good low end, and has some sparkle as well. Use the gain knob on the clean channel, and you can get up into classic rock territory. It's also a great pedal platform.
The gain channel is awesome, and a bit unique. It's a Marshall, 80's and 90's hard rock and metal amp. But you can play modern music on it. A ton of gain on tap, and really good thump.
I'm just really amazed at the value here. This amp does what most of your amps that cost twice as much, or more. And, this amp sounds better than many of those more expensive brands. Gear snobs may not approve of my new amp, but that's OK. I have a Mesa Boogie Mark IV, and a Peavey Classic 50, and this amp is as good as either. Bugera has a good thing going. 
I have not had to contact Bugera, so I can't comment on support. 
The amp doesn't look extremely fancy, but it looks good. I didn't buy it for the looks, though. 
The Infinium feature is really cool. You can put all different kinds of power tubes in these bad boys. I will probably replace the tubes. It sounds great as is, but you can probably get better tubes. I'm probably going to put some 6L6 tubes in here, at some point.
Thanks Bugera, and zZounds.                 
This thing really puts up when you want it to. It is very versatile and can really be used to dial in any tone you could want. The low end on this thing is outrageous. It will rumble everything in your house/space. For the price, you really can't get a bette amp. It can hand with some of the top boutique amps. The infinium technology is very useful and all the options with it are amazing. The pentode triode switch helps you cut the power if necessary.                
This thing sounds just like a Jcm900 if you upgrade the tubes. Ive had many heads in the past(jcm900, 5150, triple x's, jxs's) and this one is right up there with those. This head does exactly what i wanted it to and sounds way better than expected, cleans are great, the clean is even a great overdrive channel if you turn the gain up. the Actual gain channel is great as well, has more distortion than you will ever need unless you are playing straight up metal and with a nice overdrive pedal ie-tubescreamer that would be no problem. But of course it helps if you put some nice quality valves in it.                
I love how you can turn on/off the reverb on it with the footswitch although it would be nice if it had an indicator light so you could tell when its off/on. Love the pentode triode switch on the back to cut the power in half. Controls are practically identical to a jcm900. The infinum actually helps to, if you switch power amp tubes it auto bias them so you don't have to mess with that and it lets you know exactly which tube is burnt out as well which is a very nice feature.                
Really easy to use got a great tone dialed in, in about 5 minutes pretty much have kept it since.                
The head seems pretty sturdy so far and i think the former faults of bugera have long passed. But of course the wood used is not as high of a quality as you would get in a jcm 900 but who cares its just the head right? Switch out the tubes and you've got one hell of an amp head at one hell of a price.                
best amp head for the money without a doubt if you're looking for a high gain rock head. I would probably buy it over a jcm900 to be honest just because it sounds identical and its half the price.                
Haven't had to deal with them yet but i've heard they're pretty good.                
Killer head, one of the best investments I've made in a while                
Great amp Great Price, BUY IT!!!                
First off,let me say Bugera has GREAT customer service. They had to replace two of these 1990s for me. The first lasted two months. The second just two weeks. In fairness though,I own the original 1990,some of which had quality control issues. These new Infinium versions are very reliable with all of the Q.C. issues resolved. Great tone. Simple. Strait forward. Basically a Marshall JCM900 clone but with more gain! Two channels - clean & overdrive. Pretty good clean but it is the drive channel that kicks butt here! I know from experience that the cab one uses is the key to a great tone with these heads. If you use a lower end cab (Bugera,Behringer etc.) it will sound good,but I'm using a Marshall JCM900 cab with 2 Celestion G12s & 2 Warehouse Guitar Vet 30s for a sick mid drenched Marshall tone to die for! This is a great head for the money. I really like it...                
This thing is a beast! With a tube change and some decent speakers this animal is almost indistinguishable from some much more pricey Marshalls. Pushing the "clean" channel yields some nice, warm JCM800-like tones. The drive channel is a bit too compressed and treble-heavy for my tastes (basically exactly what a JCM900 sounds like) but with some simple mods I'll have an incredible sounding amp for recording. This is a hard rock/metal amp for sure.                  
This amp is amazingly versatile. I know most people getting it are playing what they refer to as metal, but usually all you can find in reviews are people that drop to A and chugga chugga. Not me. My band tunes to D standard, we play power and thrash metal in the style of Blind Guardian, Iced Earth, Kreator, basically not drop tuned metalcore. So, if you're an old school guy looking at this amp, it will deliver. From old school thrash to modern progressive, yes even to metalcore and djent, it's all achievable if you spend some time with the eq section. I run an LTD EC1000 and a Schecter C-1 Hellraiser to this amp, along with a noise gate and an op amp modded TS9 tubescreamer. It's simply a blast to play with, on stage or in the studio.                
The most useful feature to me is the Infinium technology. Knowing exactly which tube to replace, and being able to mix and match el34 and 6l6 is very helpful. The noise gate is not great. It eliminates a little hiss, but you're going to need a noise gate in your signal chain, but you knew that already. The reverb means nothing to me, it doesn't sound great, but you're not buying this amp for the reverb.                
The eq on this amp is very touchy, which I like. As soon as I turned it on and switched all the knobs to the noon position, I was given a usable tone, even through a crappy old Behringer cab I had laying around the house. There is a learning curve to sculpt your sound accordingly, but then again any tube amp worth its salt does. I rank it with Peavey 6505+ level ease of use, in that you have to try to make this amp sound bad.                
The tolex and the chrome plastic are really the only give aways to where corners were cut. The tolex feels a little cheap, but who cares really? It's tolex. The knobs feel great, the input jacks are nice and tight. Everything seems well ventilated, as mine doesn't run too hot after hours of play, and is relatively quick to cool, especially compared to my Peavey 6505+ 1x12 combo. It's a hefty amp, it feels solid. I know Bugera have had quality control issues in the past, so I can't really comment further, other than to say nothing feels cheap about this amp upon inspection.                
Honestly, I cannot think of a better amp for the price point. It sounds better than the 6505+ amps I've played with and been around, which are usually made with higher quality components and can be found at a comparable price used. I operate a small project studio, and because of the sonic ground this amp covers, it's extremely valuable to me. I have coaxed Dual Recto, 6505+, and JCM 800 tones out of this box so far, using only a tubescreamer and the on board eq section. I know many people will turn their nose up at it, but I think that would be a huge mistake. I've played guitar and gigged for 13 years now, I'm very particular and obsessive about my gear, and I think any guitar player would be lucky to own one of these, as long as you take somewhat decent care of it. Oh yeah, the footswitch that comes with it feels super nice, very sturdy.                
I haven't had a reason to contact them yet, so we'll see.                
I find it sexy, but that's subjective to personal taste.                
I love this amp. I've thoroughly run a gamut of tone tests with it, and it has delivered every time. I gig about a lot, with a variety of metal/punk bands. I've been around Marshalls, Mesas, Peaveys, Blackstar, etc... Most of the heavy hitters without getting into crazy boutique territory (Soldano, Bogner, etc...), and I no longer feel any lust for those amps since the 333xl arrived.                
Sound is amazing, tone shaping options are virtually endless. VERY LOUD pre gain and post gain settings help you shape the tonal sensitivity of your playing and the master just for the balls of the amp itself                
each channel has its own EQ and is very customizable which is great for players that switch between leads and rhythms. i use the lead channel for my leads (obviously) and i have set a nice rhythm tone on the crunch channel for switching off of playing high leads. The lead channel has a very nice response for frequencies above roughly 600Hz (almost a D# 5) the high end comes out clear and the warm tube sound gives it amazing character. I have one negative to say about the features, the onboard noise gate is not as amazing as bugera makes it out to be, it doesnt cut out the high hiss (usually above 2KHz) and feedback is an issue if using the amp above bedroom volumes, however this could be fixed by patching a noise gate pedal in the effects loop or however you like to use your pedals.                
The amp was easy for me to dial in a tone however if you are not familiar with using pre and post gain (channel volume and gain knobs on the amp) and the eq you may have a hard time reaching a tone that you like, however most people like using the middle section of everything and call it good, thats not me...im a tone chaser and i found a great tone in this amp that i think i can settle with for a long time.                
Made very well, nice tolex, nice tubes, very heavy power transformers, just overall very nicely made.                
WELL WORTH IT, i used the payment option and its working out nice because i thought i could never get my very own tube amp.                
Havent needed to do so yet, also i hope i dont ever have to.                
Its greatly loud, i was moving from a solid state 100W amp to this 120W amp, and if i didnt know the power rating of this amp, i would assume that it was like a 400W amp or even more beacuse of how loud it is.                
Overall its a great head, amazing tone, and huge sound. The only reason I didnt put 5 on ease of use and manufacturer support is because you need to be a little experienced to dial a tone out and i havent had to use manufacturer support.                
Could not have been happier with this purchase, the amp sounds great I have it paired with the 212ts cabinet and this thing is so damn loud. 
The eq knobs are very responsive, and actually even a slight turn can create some interesting sounds. So tinker around a bit with it!
The reverb control is a great feature, especially since you can have it on/off on any channel you choose. 
The first channel I gave a whirl was of course the clean channel, which the cleans are so responsive and cranking the bass up a little gives it some girth and body. Amazing for running effects through and the articulation is great.
The crunch channel I tinkered with for maybe 5 minutes before I had already found my perfect rhythm tone (I play Seven string guitars tuned to A and a les paul tuned 1/2 step down to Alice tuning.) and this channel definitely delivers!
The lead channel was a tad underwhelming at first glance, but realized later my dumb butt accidently took the cord to my fx loop and put in in the guitar input so things got a little screwy lol. (no fault on the amp) After that mix up and tinkering with the lead channel with/without overdrive this amp is a beast! I won't be buying a new amp for awhile now, I'm set in stone with this amp and this zZounds crew has been very helpful and they will have plenty more business from me.                
I bought the Bugera 333XL Infinium to replace my Peavey 5150 that recently died after 15 years. Straight out of the box, I was a little leery at first. I had hoped that the tone on the crunch and lead channels would have been more full. But then, I did some fine tuning and OMG .. I love this amp. The clean channel is superbly clean. Even the crunch and lead channels has a great clarity to it. If you're looking for a great amp on a budget like I was, this is definitely the amp for you.                 
I have had all solid-state amps before this one (except one amp that was a hybrid, with a tube preamp and solid-state power amp), so I was apprehensive about tube amps, but I really wanted to experiment. I play mainly thrash, power metal, and death metal, so I needed a very high gain amp. I have used this one for home recording, band practice, and gigging and it has really exceeded expectations in each scenario. I do not use any pedals or effects and this amp has all the tone I could want right out of the box. The clean channel is glistening, but not too chimey, and has a pretty neutral tone that is responsive to the EQ knobs. The crunch channel has plenty of gain for anything from southern rock to brutal death metal. The lead channel has even more available gain and has a bit more of a modern high-gain amp sound (the crunch channel sounds a bit more old-school). An extra feature is the "XL" button on each channel that adds some low end without getting too muddy. The built-in reverb is pretty standard and sounds good... would have been absolutely killer if it were real spring reverb, but it is not bad at all. The built-in noise gate on the lead channel doesn't seem to do a whole lot; it does reduce some of the hum/buzz from the distortion, but if you want silence, I would recommend running a noise gate through the effects loop. All-in-all, my gripes are really minor. I am extremely happy with this amp and it has quickly become my primary for two of my bands.                
I use this for a metal band.  We switch from high gain to clean guitar a lot in our set.  I sure do love the way this works and sounds.                
Best new amp in the price range!                  
The sound of the lead and crunch channels are good, FOR OVERDRIVE. chords are crunchy and mean yet still retain the sound of the chord.  The clean channel gets distorted by high output pickups/Pedals but you can always just dial back the volume on your pedal/guitar a little and it still sounds fabulous.                
the most useful feature is the reverb. i heard it waasn't "all there" but man. i hit that switch and all of the sudden im in a nice big cave. least useful feature is probably the noisegate... as a matter of fact.. What noisegate? Oh and something else amazing...the included footswitch. i love you bugera.                
Pretty easy for funk, jazz, country, and classic rock. for melt your face of gain you definately will need a distortion pedal. but as far as great sounds go..just plug it in and turn it on. turn a knob a couple inches... there ya go. The variety of sound is good and its very dynamically responsive.                
Cosmetically perfect. the picture certainly does not do the amp justice. The insides and the tubes look very well made. built like a tank. I bet it could survive more than a few falls. the craftmanship is that of a $1000-$2000 amp head. then i looked at the where its made... MADE IN CHINA 
Since when do the chinese make such high quality musical equipment. It puzzles me. but i guess im going to put it to the test! Looks like it can. if it does is a whole diofferent story. for that we will have to see...                
Its worth so much more!                
Haven't had to contact bugera. (this zzounds support team is phenomenal though!)                
Lets just keep it censored and say..its very nice lol                
You get more than you pay for that's for sure only complaint is it cant handle super high output without distorting it.  That means dialing back the volume of your distortion pedal or volume pot on your guitar (probably more so with active pickups)
another is the lead channel is more of a overdrive than a distortion, but hey, thats what distortion pedals are for, didn't plan to use the lead channel anyway!                
Put it this way...I relieved all my Marshall gear of duty and I have 2 of these heads along with 2 custom built, for Robbe Zappa (Me), 4x12 cabs with dual Eminence Patriot and dual Eminence Swamp Thang 12"speaka's!  Snake skin punked them out and every show I got musicians swarming up to the stage asking HTF I get my sound...BUGERA is the sh!t hands down...and I build tube amps!  Exactly the features a studio, practicing or live musician need and a sound that is barely comparable.  PLUS I purchased a Bugera Vintage 22 combo that is rocking my musician friends, students and fans world.  For my style I swapped out the speaker with an Eminence Patriot and the tubes with Electro-Harmonix (although I usually prefer JJ's) and these tubes were the winning ticket.  And to drive the preamp just a tad I use a Daphan (Australian made) Preamp Overdrive...not a distortion pedal cuz it synthesizes distortion...but an OD pedal.  I've used it for metal, classic rock, blues and lent it to a friend for jazz, folk rock, originals and 'yes' even Van Halen rock!  A great sound 'almost' always means a great gig so anyone that may be pondering over Bugera vs "name brand" let it go brother...go with a good sound and not a piece of outdated past.  PLUS you can swap EL34/EL84 power tubes with 6L6/6V6 and bias the amp with a simple RCA cable with one end bare and a a volt meter.  So ask yourselves this; do you want a killer sound with full features or a "so-called" prestigious name plastered on an outdated product that fails to meet a guitarists total needs?  At the end of the day people aren't going to say, "wow he had a Marshall, or wow he had a Fender".  But what they are going to say is "WOW WHAT AN AWESOME TONE"!  And then they will glance on the stage and see "Bugera".  ~ Robbe Zappa (Robbe Zappa Band)                
There are to many to discuss to the average reader but to put it in a nutshell...diversity, ingenuity, performance and a brown sound baby!                
Not really a learning curve, great sound...? just plug in, turn on and play.  The rest is icing on the cake.                
Cosmetically beautiful, made like a Dodge (Ram tough), no worries about longitivity....at all.                
The price is AMAZING for the quality, features, reliability and tone.  As I said, I sold all my Marshall and only play Bugera now.                
I have dealt with the company...not for any problems but to "seek" an endorsement.   I have 2 333XL heads, one custom / one stock..  I have spoken with there tech specialist in the past and he was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.                  
Features, quality, reliability and tone.                
I'd replace with Bugera in a heartbeat                
 When my Randall just wasn't cutting it and I needed something with a full awesome tone from dirty to full on metal all the way back to crisp cleans ....... I made the best trade of my life when I got the Bugera 333XL-INFINIUM Guitar Amp Head .                
Its built like a tank and cant get any easier to use.  You can get any tone yer looking for ..the effects loop is flawless. the footswitch is nice and durable and has a nice long cord. I love it! noise gate helps but you will still need something in addition.  all kinds of gain and boost...it rocks                
This amp was made for all style's of rock!  Between the 2 separate Gain channels, you can get ANY sound you could ever want (when it comes to gain).  The cleans could use a bit of body, and the Reverb can be a bit weak, but it's still there and the fact that the Reverb operates independently on all 3 channels (you can set it ON in Clean, OFF in Crunch, and ON in Lead, and it remembers when you switch channels) makes it a pretty cool feature.  I want to retube it to put more body in the cleans, but as a rock head, this can't be beat, for the price.   I won't buy another head for the rest of my life, unless it's another one of these.  It's also very tough, despite what others say about it.  Full of features, and insanely affordable, you'd be crazy to turn this deal down                
I bought this head last year in 2011 and unfortunately sold it to pay a few bills.  This head sounded beastly the only thing is the stock tubes aren't fully biased (at least on mine) and couldn't even reach the manufacturer specs even when turning the biasing dial all the way up.  Pretty much the tubes ran extremely cold weren't and couldn't suck the power they needed to really get that full flavored tone.  I threw some JJ ECC803's and JJ 6L6's and it made a world of difference tone wise and I was able to turn the bias knob down drastically.  Overall this head is amazing for the price, I just suggest throwing in some after market tubes                
Three channels of gorgeous tones. From the clean to the extreme I got exactly the kind of sound I wanted. The EQ knobs are very responsive. Haven't had a chance to run effects yet.                 
This amp has it all. You can get any sound you want out of this thing. It has sparkling cleans, all the way to high gain distortion. Without doubt one of the BEST sounding amps out there, PERIOD. Here's where that changes.
This amp head is built like a tank on the outside. The internals are much different, made of cheap chinese parts. Have you ever seen a "high end" tube amp for under $1200? Theres a reason.
After a month and a half of ownership, this amp quit on me in the middle of a gig. How embarassing. Set it back up at home, and it works perfect. 
I talked with the manufacturer, and they wanted to slap me with a large bill to send it for a warranty claim because, "They probably would not find an issue, and would have to charge me for shipping and labor." I am now stuck with an amp that I can not trust. Awesome.
Save yourself a headache and buy a real amp from a real company who doesn't make cheap knock offs of other company's designs.                
have had it a couple weeks. no problems. great tone and very loud.                
Great effects and superb signal to board in a compact unit. Lightweight but full on sound and body. Best features for the money out there.                
For the level of playing I do, it sounds great. Whether playing my 1964 Gibson LG-1, or my 2011 Epiphone Dot Studio I can dial in really nice clean sounds, or get dirty with the Epiphone. OK up against a Fender Princeton Reverb it falls a bit short, but c'mon. I haven't recorded with it, not into that yet, but in a living room it sounds great. The headphone feature is fantastic. I'm a bit of a night owl, and at 1:30 in the morning wailing away in my apartment, I frequently check to make sure I'm really hearing waht I hear through a set of Skull Candy phones. I like the shift button to fill out the sound, or without for twang. All in all $108.00 no tax no shipping, it's a deal.                
No accessories included, none needed. Nice smooth controls. A reverb or chorus would be nice, but again I bought a simple amp on purpose. I do get a decent tube sound because of the single pre-amp tube.                 
A little playing around with the controls and you can dial up some very satisfactory sounds, clean to dirty. No mysteries with the controls. Again, my 1964 Gibson LG-1 has a Barcus Berry Insider pick-up and it sounds natural with a bit of experimentation. Who needs a manual? Volume, Bass Treble and a mid-pushbutton enhancement, gain, on-off.                
It seems to be well made, no problems with shake rattle and roll, unless you want it to shake rattle and roll. I don't think people who buy this are planning a major tour, but to take over to a friends house to jam a bit, it's perfect. Heavy enough to feel like an amp, light enough to sit on the car seat beside you.                
Yes.                
No experience in this category.                
I'm nearing 58 yrs old so I grew up with what many consider to be some classic amps. THIS IS ONE COOL LOOKING AMP ! The cream color is very pretty, and sitting next to my worn brown Epiphone Dot Studio it's a really nice set-up. I'm never going to open for U2, so for the past couple of years I've made an effort to get stuff that looks great as long as it's also primarily functional. An Epiphone EJ-200, Dot Studio and now The Bugera BC15 all very nice visually.                
I originally wanted an all-tube Vox amp, but after calling retailers all over the country and finding out that the particular Vox was discontinued, I went with the BC15. Some of my music purchases now are based on what I wanted as a kid and never got, like a Vox amp. If I buy another amp it will be partially due to nostalgia. I'm currently very happy with this amp sound, function, and visually. I don't see any reason I would not replace this with another one if it were stolen. Again, I play for fun, by myself or with a friend or two so it meets my needs. I love the headphone feature, the range of sounds and the appearance. There's really no least liked feature. At just over a hundred dollars, not bad at all.                
I bought it specifically for tone since I have a pedal board and this little guy delivers!  The clean is very good (although I haven't really pushed this amp since it's my practice amp), not Fender clean but definitely clean enough, I play funk quite a bit so I need a pretty clean sound.  The gain channel is good too, however if you're into metal or hard rock, this amp may not fit your style unless you're looking to get into heavy distortion using a pedal.  One thing I did notice about the amp is that it doesn't handle my Big Muff fuzz well (it's fine with my boss DS-2 tho) but like I said, it's my practice amp and I just wanted to get a good full tone well and I'm able to do that.                
I was specifically looking for an amp that didn't have effects on it so I see this as a positive.  Just the bare minimum on this thing, I liked that there are 2 channels and even though I don't use the bass/bright switch, I think this is a good feature to have for those that are using humbucker guitars (I have a strat and jag and I don't use the bright switch since I have single coil guitars) for at least another option.  The headphone output is a nice option, especially if you're just starting out or if you're in an apt complex or something; it would be nice to have a middle knob to hone in more on the tone but this amp but hey, considering the price, it's more than enough amp.                
Fewer features so very easy to use.  You will find your tone probably within the first hour of playing with it and if not, for sure sometime during the first day of trying it out.  Like I said, it works well with all my pedals except for the Big Muff but it's fine with my distortion (boss ds-2) and over drive pedal (fulltone ocd).                
This is a well built amp, the vintage look is AMAZING and the materials are solid, exactly what I expected since there aren't any effects on it.  The speaker sounds great and this little amp fools everyone, it's much louder than you'd think considering its size.  Similar to the microcube in size and loudness; I suppose you could gig with this if you're plugging into the PA however, it's probably much more realistic to use this amp in a studio recording session and I think that's something much more plausible.  As sturdy as it is, I'd still have a backup if I was going to try to gig with it just because it's so space efficient anyway.                
It all depends on what you're going for, this little guy works out great for what I need, if you're looking for a cheap, simple practice amp that's going to give you marvelous tones and picking response, you will be very happy with this amp.  If you want a versatile amp that has 25 effects, boost channels and an over dose of distortion, I probably wouldn't recommend this one for that type of player. I've had it for about a month and I'm very pleased with this amp, it works perfectly for what I want it to do.                
Never had to find out...I'd say that's the best support!                
The look and feel of it is totally vintage and that was very attractive to me, I'm not really sure what other people are looking for or whatever but I was immidiately attracted to it when I saw the pictures and even more so the more I read up on it.                
I will eventually upgrade my practice amp, however, I expect that will be years from now, if it got stolen, I probably would buy it again because it's a GREAT value for the price, I can't think of a better amp for the price I payed, it's on par in regards to tone with the micro cube (which I used to own) I would say but has better picking response than the cube did for sure.  The thing I like most about it is overall everything meaning: size, tone, loudness, look; the thing I like least is probably that certain levels of distortion seem to be unreachable with the big muff pedal not that I use it often but it seems to be an obstacle.                
Well built, feels and sounds solid. Even my wife notices a difference in the sound. I've owned and played through other well known brands from Peavey, Ampeg, GK and others. For the price this thing is the bomb. I was a little skeptical because I had never heard of Turbosound speakers before. Glad I did..it seems that Bugera has stepped up it's game.                
I was a little sceptical about getting this cab because of the Behringer name associated with it. The low price coupled with the high wattage rating can be misleading bait in order to get you to buy something that doesn't live up the hype. Well I'm happy to report that I was wrong about this one. This cab has some serious bottom...not too woolly...it's nice and defined and puts out some good mids. Handles my 1000 watt head very well. I owned a GK 212 prior to purchasing this (which is also a good bass cab) but I like this one much better. I believe the cab enclosure is built by the same company that builds other high end cabs because the build quality is top notch. The grill on it is also heavy duty. And to top it off...it comes with casters. I don't know much about Turbosound speakers but this thing rocks. The wattage is really around 500 rms but I can live with thst. Its more than enough for me. Can't say enough how pleased I am with this product. Unbelievable value for your money!                
This works fine, of course you need to know how to dial in the sub woofer sound on your own, but it does a fine job. 
Good for small to medium gig's. 
It's a 2000 watt Max in which I use a EuroPro 2000 800 watt combo channel. 
Works fine. If had a real bass head it would probably be better.
But after 10-15  shows I can't tell the difference.                 
I bought this because it identically resembles another cabinet design by a bass manufacturer icon. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the image. The good people at zZounds got it to me very cheap and quickly. For zZounds side they are excellent.
The cab is 17" deep and very clumsy to move around for one person. It was more like a coffee table. Or even a table. 
I paired it up with a Bugera Veyron Mosfet, and I had it cranked nearly 3/4 and it wasn't loud. I was expecting rumble loud-- sadly that wasn't the case. I could hear audible breakup in the speaker, i.e. distortion.
The cab itself was very well built. Might be a better cab if it's loaded with a difference speaker, maybe an Eminence or Faital with high power capabilities and a long excursion to take advantage of that deep coffee table design.
I ended up giving the cab away to a Christian band and they use it for rehearsals.
Nice looking, didn't perform.                
FIRST OFF the "Behringer watts" are 2800 but that's peak. Back of the cab says that RMS is 700 watts...still PLENTY of juice for me. This thing moves air fairly well, too, I am very pleased with it. I do like Ampeg's grille over all other brands but Bugera did a fine job with there metal grille and silver cursive name on top. It's replacing a heavily used Ampeg SVT-410HE eith mismatching speakers and is not lighter by far, only a small margin...probably 15 lbs? No comment on the tweeter, i dont care for them anyways. LOTS of lows, LOTS of mids, LOTS of highs, LOTS of volume...my amp started shaking off the top, I'm gonna have to find a way to secure it, that's the only negative I can find.                
This bass cabinet is the BOMB! When you buy this bass cabinet it will be the only bass cabinet you will ever need to buy. With the right amp that is. 2800 watts of solid muscle.You got your lows, middle, highs. It packs a super punch knockout! I use a SWR 700 working pro bass amp. I have the master volume set half way, bass all the way up, mid 12 o'clock,, treble 3 quarters, enhancer pushed in and wow! I only did two gigs with it. If it holds up OMG! I use a Schecter six string bass. With my bass, SWR 700 working pro, Bugera BN410 bass speaker cabinet its a match made in heaven!!!! Allen Reynolds                
A great cabinet,,, I am very satisfied with this cab that I purchased two. if you are looking for power and clarity along with lightweight the Bugera is the way to go                
Unbelievable  sound..  I was so impressed  I bought  a second one too stack up..  Clean sound with  the depth  punch and high end that's needed  for today's music...  And the price  is sugar sweet                
This cab is in the class of the big names ... I am extremely satisfied with its output... unlike most other cabs the low end is almost right there in your face, on this cab you have to dial it in a little more from your amp or EQ but this give you more control on shaping your sound.                
I was becoming displeased with my Eden 410 rear ported cab due to it's inefficiency. I love its tone but also wanted to get back to what was my favorite combo - a 15" and 2x10" cabs. So I began searching for alternatives. I read reviews of this Bugera cab as well as the 2x10, read up on TurboSound speaker cabs and went with my gut - I bought this 15" cab and the matching 2x10 cab. I definitely had my reservations because of the Bugera name (sorry!) but something just told me to go for it. They arrived and I tested them that night. I biamped them into my Eden WP100 preamp and was completely stunned. Just floored to be completely honest. 
The next night I had a gig and set them up, played a few notes and the bandleader looked at my bass rig, looked at me, then back at the rig and said, "that's the best sounding one yet". I had to agree. After the first song, a fan came up to me and said "That! That sounds great!", meaning my new bass speakers of course. I had to agree.
I've played for over 20 years as a bassist, owned so many cabinets (and amps) and maybe one combo satisfied me almost as much, but these have a fidelity that, like another reviewer said, rivals the Bergantino 15". I have to agree. This combo by far is better than everything I've ever owned or used. I'll list what I've owned only: Aguilar 4x10, Peavey 2x15 (black widows), Mesa Boogie 2x15", Acoustic 1x18 fridge, Eden D410T, SWR Goliath 1x15, GK 4x10XT, Bag End 2 2x10's, custom 1x15 and 2x10, Warwick 2x10" and 2x12", oversized 1x15" with 400 watt Eminence, Sunn 6x10 slant speaker cab. I'm sure I've forgotten a couple. And of course I've played through all the classic cabs and some boutiques: Ampeg 8x10, SWR 6x10, Ashdown 8x10, GK's of all types, SWR's of all types, Bergantino, Schroeder. 
Basically, this Bugera combo literally smokes them all, IMHO, in tone, clarity, fidelity, warmth, punch and headroom.
Like I said, I'm completely floored and I'm so glad I listened to my gut. If any bassist is on the fence, I'm telling ya', I'll be shocked if you aren't floored. Buy them with confidence. Turbosound makes incredible speakers and cabinets, so that starting point alone should give you comfort. 
The only thing separating this from being an instant classic/standard is its longevity. So here's to them holding up to the rigors of many years of performance stamina.

I have been using this cabinet for almost a year now...  I have been playing Bass since 1978 and have played through many different combinations.  This has fantastic clarity and good low end responses for a Mid Cabinet.  I have had whole SVT Stacks that sounded worse.  Not sure if the 1600 Watt will hold but it has done fine through my 1000W power amp.  Has an adjustable 1" HF driver is great and amazing for high-end control. Only wish it had hand grips on both sides. I use it with an Ampeg 1x15 and it is an awesome combo for BASS.  My Logo is Chrome (not black nickel look like photo) - but did my research and new what I was getting.  Great Job - Good Value!                
I'll say first that zZounds is amazing and I had a hassle-free experience. I do want to advise other musicians looking into this particular cabinet, that the logo may not be this killer blacked-out version that you see, and it may not have a tolex shell. I ordered what is pictured, and received a cabinet with a bright silver logo and a carpeted cabinet. Nobody got time for carpeted cabinets! zZounds did right by me though with the customer service so I can't go bad on them!  I rated the product highly because my issues are not sound or quality, just cosmetic.                 
I bought this cab for a small practice/church set up. Im using a Markbass 3 and this cab can handle a church the size of a school gym, even the sound guys tell me to turn it down. I have had it for 6 months and highly recommend it.                
Loving it. I play my Music Man Stingray through it with the 1600 watt Bugera Speakers and I'm well satisfied. the tone and power is what I was looking for. One Happy bass player, lol.                
Love this cab lite easy to handle after having back surgery it work's for me.Very punchy very happy with this thinking about getting one more 2X10 or a 1x15...I have a few other rigs but i love this one.....You can't go wrong for the money.... Talked to a few other bassist and now they are part of the family.....JUST DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!                
I have used Ampeg B-15 early in my career. since then i have used Sunn, Fender, and Hartke. I am currently using TC Electronics RH450 bass head. Wanted to pair the RH450 with a TC Electronics 2X10 cabinet but thought they were too high priced. So, I went for the Bugera 2X10 instead. It has all the same features including a horn. I could not have made a better choice. And recommend highly. Give Bugera a try. You would not regret it. Well made and sounds great.                
I got this cabinet yesterday from zZounds, and while the shipping and customer service was great, the product was not.  This boasts "1600 watts" and program of 400, so tell me why a Tc Electronic BH250 would make this bottom out and distort at 1/3 volume?  If you are looking for a cab to lighten your load and be able to deliver like a 410 will, this WILL NOT deliver.  Do not waste your money.                
For the price there is no complaints. Received mine, plugged it up and played. The sound was warm and clear. Can hear the highs and the lows. For all the slap players you will enjoy this amp. Enabling ultra high and ultra low will give you an amazing slap sound. You can't go wrong with the build in compression. So far I'm digging this amp. Havnt took it on gigs yet but the sound is killer .                
The tone of this bass head is nice and clean and very tight. The bottom end is more defined and never sounds muddy. The mid freq eq works very well and I had no trouble dialing in the sound that I wanted. Never had to use the ultra high button at all.  Even when I tried to push it hard it still stayed tight  and clean.                
I found all of the on-board features to work just fine. The compression mode worked very well for me. All the notes were even and well defined.  The head itself is very quiet. I had to check it a few times to make sure it was still on. The amp feels solid and doesn't have that cheap appearance at all. I will agree with one review that said that the master volume dial felt loose. I too fell that it could have a tighter feel to it like the rest of the control knobs.                 
This amp head is so easy to use a five year old could operate it. Simple an straight forward.                
It appears to be made rather well. It has a nice solid feel to it. It's appearance is very appealing . As far as quality, that depends on the internal parts used to build it with. Let's just hope that the parent company Behringer had their heads in the right place and used good solid quality parts. Only time will tell!                
Alot of ban for the buck. If you want to spend more for the same specs, all I can say is go for it. There are plenty of companies out there that will gladly take your money for a lot less product.                
I'll have to pass here. I haven't had to use them yet.                
I don't know about having a big wow factor. but I will say that it gets the job done and with very little effort.                
I have been playing bass for 50+ years and have tried or owned them all. Fender. Ampeg. MarkBass and even TC. I have to say that I am very impressed with this new Bugera bass head. It has a nice tight clean tone which for the music that I play that is a plus.  This amp did everything I asked of it plus more. Beats my Hartke HA5500C hands down.                
I HAVE BEEN GIGGING A TC ELECTRONICS RH450 AND RH750 FOR SOME TIME NOW AND REALLY LOVE THOSE 2 AMPS. WHEN I FIRST SAW THE VEYRON I THOUGHT THEY HEAVILY COPIED THE RH HEADS WITH THE SIDE HANDLE, DYNAMIZER TECHNOLOGY (APM), AND COMPRESSION (SPECTRACOMP). UPON PURCHASING IT, THE 2 ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. THE RH HEADS BEING DARKER AND POWERFUL SOUNDING WHILE THE VEYRON SOUNDING BRIGHTER AND THINNER IN THE NOTES BUT WITH A LOT MORE POWER BACKING IT UP.    PRETTY MUCH ANY AMP CAN GET LOUD, SOME SOUND OBNOXIOUS WHILE OTHERS SOUND POWERFUL. THIS AMP IS SERIOUSLY POWERFUL. RUNNING AN EARLY 2000’S BC RICH NJ SERIES WARLOCK WITH ACTIVE PUPS, GAIN AT 9:00, MASTER AT 11:00, AND MID SELECTOR AT 220, THIS AMP WAS SLAMMING THE STAGE LITERALLY. EVERYTIME I HIT THE E, D, OR C NOTES ON THE A STRING, IT FELT LIKE HULK HOGAN WAS BODY SLAMMING ANDRE THE GIANT ON THE STAGE. I HAVE NEVER FELT THAT BEFORE WITH ANY AMP PERIOD. THE NOTES HAD SUCH HEFT, IT WAS INCREDIBLE. IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HARD CLIP AS YOU INCREASE THE GAIN. IT JUST GETS LOUDER AND BREAKS UP. IT CLEARLY IS EMULATING A TUBE AMP. I HAVE BEEN RUNNING IT ON A GK NEO 410 4 OHM THAT CAN HANDLE 1600 WATTS PEAK. I NEVER WORRY ABOUT DAMAGING THOSE SPEAKERS BUT WITH THIS AMP, I AM PRETTY CAUTIOUS. I DON’T KNOW IF IT REALLY PUTS OUT 2000 WATTS PEAK BUT IT SURE DOES SOUND AND FEEL LIKE IT COULD. IT SOUNDS GREAT ON THE GK NEO 410 AND THE BRUSHED METAL AND BLACK TOP MATCHES THE AESTHETICS OF THAT CAB PERFECTLY. THE TONE FLAT IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TCE. SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THE RH AND THE GK MB HEADS BUT SEEMS AS YOU CAN COME CLOSE TO BOTH. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET A VERY SIMILAR RH450 HEAD SOUND OUT OF IT BY CRANKING UP THE BASS. THE EQ IS PRETTY FLEXIBLE AND BOTH THE ULTRA LOW AND ULTRA HIGH BUTTONS CHANGE THE SOUND CONSIDERABLY BUT NOT IN A BAD WAY. THE ULTRA LOW ACTUALLY SCOOPS THE MIDS AND CREATES A SERIOUSLY PUNCHY SOUND THAT IS GREAT WITH A PICK BUT SOUNDS TINY (HARD TO EXPLAIN) ON THE HIGH NOTES. WHILE THE ULTRA HIGH CAN SOUND VERY MODERN AND PINGY AND CAN PROBABLY PULL OFF A GK MB TONE. YOU CAN’T HEAR MUCH CHANGE ON THE MID SELECTOR AT QUIET VOLUMES BUT AT GIG VOLUME, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE CHANGE. 220 COVERS THE SLAM AT LOW MID TONE WHILE 3K CAN GET EXTREMELY SPARKLY AND PIERCING. CHECK OUT THE YOUTUBE VIDEO WITH DOUG WIMBISH PLAYING WITH VICTOR WOOTEN AND YOU CAN CLEARLY HEAR HOW HIGH AND SPARKLY THIS AMP CAN GET. I’M PRETTY SURE IT WAS BEING RUN AT 3K. SOUNDS GREAT ON THE VIDEO BUT ON A GIG, IT IS JUST WAY TOO HIGH FOR MY TASTE.I CAN’T SAY THIS WILL REPLACE MY RH HEADS AS MY GO TO HEAD AS THOSE AMPS ALSO SOUND POWERFUL AND CAN COVER PRETTY MUCH ANY GIG THAT HAS COME UP. PLUS THEY HAVE MANY EXTRA FEATURES THAT THIS AMP DOES NOT AND THE TONE IS PERFECT FOR ME. HOWEVER THE VEYRON WILL DEFINITELY GET PLENTY OF GIG TIME AS THE EXTRA HEADROOM THIS AMP PROVIDES IS REALLY SOMETHING AND THAT SLAM I WAS TALKING ABOUT IS REALLY ADRENALINE INDUCING. ALSO THE FAN IS ALMOST SILENT. DEFINITELY A KEEPER.
About a year ago a friend referred this amp to me, he had just purchase it him self, he told me how much he like it.I said cool glad you like it! I have not thought much about that conversation until recently. I was in the market for another amp to back-up my TC Electronic BH 800 bass amp. So the second amp has to have a great sound and great value because the TC ain't no.joke sound wise! Fortunately I was bless to get the Bugera in my hands, though my friend told about his I never heard it until I ordered my mines and receive it! I got here it fairly quickly, the sound is wonderful so many tonal options yet very easy to control, 5 position mid switch and built-in compressor is a huge bonus at the price range! The weight is great at around 6lbs and 2000 watts @ 4ohms, the head room is incredible! Truthfully this could the number one amp! But I still love my TC, but for a second amp Bugera is off the chain!!!! :-) all I can say is watch out TC don't break down because the Veyron Bugera is on your tail extremely close lol!!                
Great head lite and compact i can carry in me bag.....Alot of my friends have this head and love it......I do a lot of major gig's and work with major artist and i can carry this head with me and use other cab's it works great.Will be getting the cab soon for small in town gig's.......loving it great head......I would love to endorse this product it's hot!                
I bought this as a expensive back up to a 6.2 Genz Benz shuttle, and a Eden 550 WT buT this with my Hartke Hx cabinets have become my main club rig. The ultra low and hi switch is great when slapping. I don't know if it is  really  2000 watts, maybe 600 but it's loud enough for what I do. IMHO you can't beat this head for the price.i can't speck about tech support because I have not needed them yet.                
This amp has tons of power. It has a nice tight low end. Lets you find your sound in no time.  Weights less than 8 pounds.  Great for practice at home or on the stage or as a backup for the stage!                
I bought this head for rehearsal use. So far so good. The price was right for the power it has. For me, the compression is a little weak,but not that bad. I am satisfied with this unit.                
this product did not work out for me after 2 weeks playing gigs with the amp begin clipping and my sound was going in and out so after trying 2 different bass heads i just decided to return it.                
When I retired my beloved Trace Elliot Stack, mainly due to size constraints, I went looking for a smaller Class D Head. Tried virtually everything out there, and even brands costing twice as much or more, didn't sound nearly as good as the Bugera BV1001T. I own two of them! The main reasons are this: The Bugera sports a 6 stage All Tube Class A pre-amp section, which the others don't, making for a much warmer, fatter, less compressed overall sound. It also features an optical compressor, which is extremely adjustable to any style.The controls are well laid out and very responsive. The mid frequency control will remind Ampeg fans of the old SVT's! The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is because Bugera did not make full use of the amp's capabilities in one area. As the unit has a tube pre-amp, why not put a drive section in the front panel, and on the footswitch, to be able to turn a little grit on, ala' the Trace Elliot AH1200. It would have made an already great amp even more versatile! As for it being 2000 watts? Not really sure about this, I run one of my BV1001Ts through 2 Bugera 2X10s and the other through A Bugera 2 X10, and one of their compact 1 X 15s, either set-up SPANKS!!! At least a 1000, maybe 1200 watts at 4 ohms. Bottom line is it is more than capable of playing just about any type of gig, with any style.                
I have waited a few months to write a review, instead of a two-day WOW! review. I have been using a BBE B max-T with a Crown 1500w power amp into two Acme Low B-2s as my main rig for years. I was tired of lugging a 40" rack for a small gig with one speaker, so I did some research. I chose the Bugera BV1001T, and it has worked out great. Less that 9 # with the case - it kicks it with either one or two power-hungry Acme speakers. The EQ took a bit - bass is flat at about 10 o'clock, and I wound up setting the treble pretty high. The selectable mids are great for when I switch between fretted and fretless basses - and I need the "mwah" Now that I've spent some time with this, I love it! My only quibble is that I replaced the Chinese 12AX7 tubes with JJ's, and it did improve the sound some - not a lot, but you can hear it when you crank the gain - which I do. It's very warm, and makes a perfect amp for my blues/rock gigs. I haven't taken my "big rig" out in months. If I ever need a perfectly squeaky-clean hi-fi sound for a big room, I'll probably drag it out. Otherwise, it's the Bugera - which cost half as much, and weighs 1/4 as much. I recently played the Hard Rock Café Atlanta with it, and everybody that heard it loved it, and couldn't believe the size and power. This thing, run properly, is both warm and clear, with tons of headroom. I doubt the supposed 2000 watt rating, but it does kick my two Acmes (highly power-hungry and inefficient) as hard as they'll take it. Get one, upgrade the tubes, and you'll have a great amp for rock, blues, jam bands, or country, depending how much you hit the gain and volume. Simple EQ - but all you need. I give this an A+ - and in over 40 years, I've played a Bassman, an Acoustic 360, a SVT, a SWR, a Roland, a Peavy pre into a Crown amp, and several Carvin BXs. I really like this head, for what it is!                
i ordered this amp head last Friday was a little skeptical at first due to some reviews. however, my amp head came in the mail saturday morning right before church so i got the chance to give it a test run. boy o boy was i shocked with the results. the lows on this bass were amazing i felt everything on my B string and it was very clean as well. i could really tell the difference between my hartke and bugera i will definitely take my bugera with me. it was very light weight and easy to use and understand. packs a powerful punch for the price. the highs are a bit suspect but none the less it's worth the price.                
Youngest headed off to college and I've got that itch again. Was very pleased to see the tech advancement when i started shopping for new bass gear. My old rigs were crazy heavy. An entire rig lighter than my last head? Yea...
Last piece arrived today. Running head into a GK neo 212 8ohm cab. Bass is a Fender precision lyte with passive geezer emgs. 
Initial impression was NOT favorable. Started with passive and noon gain & compressor settings. Was getting clip light on medium attack notes and the compressor was dropping the volume on strikes. Yuck.
Figured my bass was running hot, so engaged the active -15db setting. The clipping stopped completely. Dropping the gain to 11:00 and raising the gain side volume to 3:00 helped overcome the -15db. The compressor revealed itself to be a very serviceable on board option with those changes. 
Other reviews have said everything else about this head. For now i love it, only durability remains to be tested.                
out powers my GK 700rb, but it should.  I'm impressed with the warm tubey tones Im getting and the construction is really good.  I'm not super impressed with the power switch in the back since I use a rack and rack effects.  Great value, good time to be a bass player.                
Tired of carrying my heavy bass head around, I love the sound of my 1000watt head, however it was just to heavy to lug everywhere.  so I've been reading about the BV1001T Veyron Tube Amp and decided to purchase one. Wow! this amp packs a punch and sound great. Your toddler or lady friend can carry it for you, it's truly that light. Bugera have done it again. Great solid controls to and user friendly.                 
I am so pleased with this choice. Great for every gig and praise and worship team venue. I love it. I will recommend this for everyone.                
Practicing at home or playing at church, I can get just the right sound required for the venue.                
For practicing, I play my mp3 player through the RCA inputs of the AUX In. Every control option I need is there on the front panel.                
The Bugera is far easier to use than my old Peavey combo from 1978. No learning curve!                
Everything about it seems well thought out and manufactured.                
For the price at which you sell it, this amp is a steal!                
I've had no problems with my amp, so no contact with the company.                
It's SO easy to use and get just the sound I want, I have no desire for any other bass amp. I got a monster bass amp for the price of a good practice amp.                
I bought mine from a local music store for $400 with a trade-in of my old Peavey 400 watt bass combo from the late 1970's. This amp is what I wished my Peavey could have been. I use the Bugera in three church services every week, and it performs splendidly. There's WAY more power than needed for a medium sized sanctuary, and I can tweak the sound of my bass for optimal sound. It has RCA inputs for a music player so I can practice. I've never heard any bass amp sound better than this one. The only place I could find a cover is http://www.amplifiercovers.com for $50, but it's really nice.                
Amazing, clear and very powerful sounds comes out of this excellent bass combo. It's a bargain for what you are getting because besides it's powerful sound you get a lot of features.  You won't find a more powerful and good sounding bass combo around this price range. I would recommend it this combo, don't think twice and get it.                 
Cuts out, clips easily doesn't produce the sound it claims it does because you cannot play loud much at all without it cutting out completely. Looked nice out of the box but on the 3rd or 4th time playing it straight from bass to amp the sound went. I turned it off and it came back but the problem is this was a backup for gigs and it's not reliable. I tried different cables, in fact bought new high end cables, even tried all the different basses I own included a $1500 Fender bass. The amp isn't right. I even plugged it into a new conditioning power supply worth $100. I am returning this bass amp. My Hartke and Eden heads can play louder and they only have 1/8th the amount of wattage this thing does. Didn't even bother calling Bugera. Don't get me wrong their guitar heads are good but this bass amp isn't their best product.                
The tips to make this amp better is put a speaker with a paper cone instead of aluminum another thing bugera need to work with bettering their craftsmanship in the electronic  with this amp for example as soon  as you plug in a passive Bass they have this annoying red light comes on and it never goes off especially when you start to dig into the amp and another thing they need to do is stop lying about the power rating saying the amps is 2000 Watts but really no louder than 500.                
One thing bugera amp need to do is stop using cheap opponents and selling it to people using Peak power to bribe the customer I mean if they got to go up on the price to make the amp better they need to do it                
I mean no harm this product is not easy to use with no other product because I couldn't even get a sound through with a passive Bass let alone an active bass guitar                
The quality is trash and they need to go back and redo this amp over again                
Anybody with common sense wouldn't sell this amp                
Music group which is the company in the USA that is supposed to be the manufacturer support team they are the worst they lied to customers and they warranty stinks and they don't know what they doing                
There's no wild Factor amp is terrible                
I went to a local music store a couple of months ago looking for a nice combo amp and soon as I plugged up and play just like the rest of bugera amp it was a technical default in the speaker and not only that it was a technical fault in the one that they replaced it with month later trust me do not buy this product if you want to maintain as a musician to get the job done and have something that is reliable do not buy this                
Bought this on a whim and loved it. Now, I can't find them in stock anywhere and so obviously I am lucky to have gotten in while the getting was good. As always it's subjective blah blah blah, but these have lush overtones with a focus on taming the highs and even out the mids in v1. I'm using a Dr. Z Maz 38 reverb 212.                
The "B" rating is what I needed to tame the gain in my pre-amp section. And the "selected" for low noise is just what I needed.. the amp is quiet with the guitar cord plugged into the pre-amp, beautiful.                
So let me start of and say this is a $300 amplifier and finding 20 watts of tube for that price can be a challenge. Bugera definitely pulled through with this. Aesthetically this thing is pretty. Tolex is firm, handles are nice, everything is SOLID.  I use the Morph EQ more than I'd ever had anticipated and it definitely opens up your tonal options. This amp sounds impressively similar to some of its more expensive counterparts without hurting your pocket. Is it all the bang of a $1500 Orange head? Maybe not, however, for 1/5th of the price you get 4/5ths of the tone (in my opinion) and I would DEFINATELY buy another Bugera product in an instant. Actually want to pick up their 1960 amp soon!                
Got this thing a few months ago and am really impressed. I really like the natural distortion/high-gain this thing creates. It has a very usable range of tones. Granted I'm no elitist tone snob. I really don't have to waste much time knob twisting because it just sounds good. I've ran my trusty versatile Jackson and a Danelectro through it... Yep, all good. Plug in yer f'n guitar and play. Its pretty sweet being able to practice at home on an all tube amp at a reasonable volume; but It can get pretty loud if you want it to. The build quality is very nice and it has looks to boot. Used it a week ago to record a punk/metal band. We ran the guitar straight in, then the amp straight to the recorder via the preamp out. It records very well, It sounds clear and even, sits well in the mix, not noisy. What more do you really need? I'm happy as can be. Also, the foot-switch has the big wide rectangular buttons, not the sub-par generic tiny buttons. That's an extra bonus. 
Haven't had to deal with manufacturer support. So there's no way to give that a fair star rating. In fact, that should not be a required field. Bugera's website seems like they aim to please so 5's across the board.                
I'd like to say I love this amp but I can't. I'd say I strongly like it. It's a fun amp to play, I can dime this thing on the clean channel (read: power tube overdrive) and get some nice crunch and not blow out the windows. Not sure why, I've had 20 watt amps before that I could not do that with (Jet City) You'll have to play around with the overdrive channel to find your sweet spot. If you want clarity and not mush, you probably won't go much past 11 o'clock on the dial. I need to do some tube swapping, the manual says you can swap 6L6 for the EL34's. I like the 34 so I probably won't do that, but you might want to try that. I've got hand wired amps that are superior for obvious reasons, but for a nice little dirty amp you can crank, this is fun to play.                
I received the amp head and the silica packet had burst in the innermost bag, leaving beads everywhere in the amp. It wouldn't power up. I would have accepted a replacement but I'd purchased the last one. I was satisfied that they allowed me to exchange for a different amp at the same price. Shipping and customer service were great, given the circumstances.                
Features - the wattage selection is a godsend! 0.1w is perfect for an apartment at full gain and half volume or less. The morph feature is nice for getting different tones plus the e's. And it comes with a footswitch. Everything I needed.
Quality - it's not light and seems to be sturdy. I've already moved it a few times without a hint of weakness in the structure or handle. It's good looking too. A little wider than my Krank 1x12 tho so it's not "micro".
Sound - clean and dirty both sound great for this price, and it should being tube pre and power. It can keep up with a drum set at full blast but it's very noisy saturated at that level. Haven't tried a 4x1w yet but I'm sure it only gets better when you let it breathe.
Overall - highly recommend this amp for players that want something legit but volume is an issue. I intend to get the matching cab but not in a rush, very happy with it as it is!                
Good quality - Great practice amp - volume easy to control and sounds good at low volumes (3 choices of power output settings). Two Channels and effects loop, input for MP3 and line out. Only thing it is missing is EQ on the Clean channel. At this price, I can live with that.                
I got this today. This thing sounds wonderful. I set it to the .1 watt setting, plugged it into my marshal 4x12 cabinet, turned the volume to 10. Great tone, and nice and quiet, so no other room in the house could hear it, but I could still get controlled feedback and really nice sustain. On the 5 w setting it was a bit louder and you could probably gig with it if you mic your cabinet through the PA. This head is well worth the money. I love the sound even without pedals. It seems well made.                
From Fender Cleans to ENGL SAVAGE BEAST Hi Gain..SOUNDS KILLER !! Have it hooked into my POD PRO X HD - 4 cable - The G5 sounds Better than the Line 6 Amp Models..which are still Great ! Very Very Happy !! Thanks Bugera! Thanks zZounds !                
I first saw this on a different site and checked zZounds to see if they have it. But they were sold out at the time. I waited and when I saw they had it in stock I ordered it. But before I placed my order I checked the web to see some reviews but there was hardly any on YouTube. I was a little skeptical due to how cheap it was but said the hell with it and bought it anyway. Well....I am glad I did. This thing really brings out the best in my Marshall DSL. I can finally get that Marshall sound I love so much with getting a Disturbing the Peace citation from the local authorities.                 
Let the 'Power' of your Amplifiers, 'S'oak' your venue, practice site, bedroom, 1 level below that which your neighbors become your enemies and the exact level that brings smiles to your fans. Like others didn't find many videos to show me it's abilities, so I took a gamble also. And glad I did. A variety of hookup options makes it an inexpensive option for an attenuator                
I was looking for a tube amp head and a 112 cab. Like a lot of people I don't have a ton of money to spend, but I wanted something that would work for what I do. When I got the amp it worked and as advised a let the power tubes warm up before I used it. this is a list of features I really like.
1. A good built in reverb.
2. An effect loop.
3. A switch for 4,8 and 16 Ohm speakers.
4. Came with a foot switch that that controls the channels and turn the reverb on or off
5. Two channels. A clean and a dirty.
6. Responsive tone and volume knobs.
7. Four pre-amp and two power-amp tubes.
8. The Infinity self bias feature for changing tubes.
9. One of the best clean channels I've ever used on a tube amp.
10. Works very well with pedals and effects units.
11. A indicator in back to let you know if the tubes need to be replaced.
12. A great price for a 50 watt all tube amp.
13. Looks great, almost like a Vox Night Train(which I believe Bugera modeled this after).
14. Works extremely well with the Burgera 112TS cab. Great cab by the way.
15. Has a fat switch which is helpful for people using single coil pickups in their guitars.
These are the thing I didn't care for.
1. A fairly bad dirty channel. It tends to get fizzy sounding when bring up the gain.
2. The Tone Cut Knob in my opinion is pretty much useless. It kill your tone and sounds like a wet blanket was put over the speaker or speakers. Maybe if you use it slightly I could see a use for it, but you're better off using your EQ and/or adding an EQ to your effects loop.
3. The stock tubes aren't that good, but then again you can't except much for an inexpensive tube amp.
I love and enjoy playing different kinds of music, but I love my metal :). Here's my temporary fix until I swap out the power tubes with a couple good 6L6s(they'll tighten up the sound of this amp a lot because this amp has a natural low tone), what I do is run a Line 6 Firehawk FX through the effects loops. What I do is lower my pre-amp gain to 4 or 5, use an HD Screamer or the HD Tube Overdrive, use a compressor to tighten up my sound and use the EQ on the Firehawk to level the tone to minimize the fizzy distrortion so I get a more than usable tone. Once I have some new 6L6GT power tubes in there it should be 100%.
Overall this is a great value that has an awesome clean channel and a dirty channels that's great at anything from blue to hard rock, but to get into the metal territory you'll need an overdrive pedal pushing the front end of this amp.                
This thing kicks ass. If you're a "pedal player" and like specific tone quality and sound, then this thing fills in that spot. For the price, the power and tone from its clean and drive channel sound superb. The effects loop works wonders along with whatever compression pedals you may use, but the drive channel may be all you need along with the footswitch that comes with it. Can't really complain about this amp, lol.                 
I read and watched a good number of reviews before I decided to pull the trigger on this head. My primary head is a Laney Ironheart 60, but I was looking for a second head that had more of a British vibe. Ironic since Laney is a British company. I really liked the styling of this amp similar to the now discontinued Vox Night Train series, and, having never played through the amp, at $300 I decided I couldn't really go that wrong.
A number of video reviews will show this amp pushing into metal territory, which I'm sure might be attainable with the master, gain, and lead volume turned all the way to 10. HOWEVER; this is not a metal amp. It does have a nice British style crunch to it on the lead channel, and the clean channel will give you sparkly cleans similar to a Vox.I, predominantly, play hard rock and metal, and this amp offers an avenue to venture into new territories and layer nice textures onto existing licks.I've only played through it for few hours now, but it's very easy to dial in with the controls not being overly sensitive. I've found that the amp has more than enough bottom end to merit turning the "phat" switch on.
The heads build quality seems to be above average. It's not boutique by any means; however, it seems sturdy and very good looking. One the first things I did; however, was yank the Bugera tubes out and replaced them with EH power tubes and Tung Sol preamp tubes. This really mitigated the fuzzy distortion that was coming from the stock tubes.
This is a really straight forward 2 channel head. Clean and lead. That's it. It's got a master volume, master reverb, and master tone cut (this control really doesn't need to be on the amp in my opinion). A very sturdy metal footswitch is included, and overall it's a very nice, easy to use package.
Echoing my previous statement; the build quality is very good. The only complaint is the factory tube set.
Bugera offers a competitive product at a very attractive price. How long will the amp last? Your guess is as good as mine, and only time will tell. But, I think it's a great bang for the buck.                
Just got the Bugera T50 a few days ago. I was a little skeptical of how it would sound for a $300 tube amp but now that I've messed with it I'm so glad I took the chance! Now in all honesty this is my first tube amp so who knows, maybe it's crap but I'm digging the sound it puts out both through my 412 and when using the speaker sims and headphones. If you're looking for a TON of gain this unit might not be for you but for what I'm using it for (think Down, Clutch, Corrosion of Conformity) it's absolutely perfect! For $300 (and includes a foot pedal) you won't be let down!                
i bought this amp, from zzounds (A1 customer service)  and having been a fan of bugera for quite some time now, i really wanted to like it. the clean channel was decent (not fender clean but did its job well enough) for me the dirty channel was more of a fuzz, and certainly was not what i was looking for. I had been using a 25 watt mesa boogie for my gigs, and though i would try this out as its 50 watts and should be able to fill and cut though the mix just fine. unfortunately, it did not. the clean channel for gigging would HAVE to be mic'd it did not cut through at all. and that was dimed out. with the mesa i never had it past half. honestly if your only playing for yourself and have pedals for your desired amount of gain, this should work just fine. anything more you might want something else                
I have a 6l6 tube Peavey ValveKing 2 and wanted a more mid range(Marshall) amp for A/B/Y set up live. So researched like crazy and could of got anything but chose this . WOW !! the clean channel is pristine-clear..i always like my peavey clean but this just has that crisp clear tone. The amp is plenty loud, i usually play on 13 watt setting at home and lkck in 22 live. reverb is good, the mid boost button def punches solos thru. My first el88 tube amp. really finding the -opposite sound to 6l6 i was looking for. What is mind boggling is the price. Only feature i would add is xlr out so i can jam in mixer and headphones at night. great amp ..gig worthy and i can do smaller gig without pedals,plenty of sounds in this amp.quite possibly the best amp bang for the buck made !                 
I purchased this amp due to the fact that it is a poor man's AC30. I love the clean channel. It can sparkle or get a little gritty. The other channel of the amp is pretty much useless to me and that is fine. I got it to be a pedal platform and it serves it's purpose well.                 
Had to change "all the tubes" after 3 months (about an hour a day) the tubes just were not as robust as the amp itself. Perhaps bugera should look into a new tube supplier. Overall a great amp. Takes pedals and loopers very well....Early british to rock.....Some metal......                
I bought this to replace a 1973 Carvin solid state amp that sounds exactly like a Marshall Plexi because the Carvin has started showing its age and losing its sparkle. I picked this amp because of the one review here and the price. I am glad I did! 22 watts is loud enough for any club I am playing in and it gets miked to boot. Everything is sensitive on this amp: the two volumes, master and the eq. The dirty channel breathes fire if you want it to and the clean channel is clean unless you push it a bit... then you are pushing the power tubes into distortion which has a pleasant vibe depending on how hot your guitar pickups are. If you are looking for an amp you want to push on stage this is it. Forget Fender... this has much more character than their deluxes and cost less that half as much. What a great amp! 
I just got the amp a week ago and have only had the chance to log a couple hours on it; but, I have to say, I love this amp. The clean channel, as most have mentioned, is gorgeous. The gain channel sounds really good with some of my guitars, kind of bad with others-- I have guitars with a variety of pick-up configurations-- so I would encourage players to mix & match (as much as you're able) to find the right guitar before you totally dismiss the dirty channel. Also, the EQ knobs do make a difference, so don't expect a "one-size-fits-all" EQ setting. For example,I had the EQ perfectly dialed in on a P90 guitar only to have it sound farty when I plugged in humbuckers-- the good news is, I found a gorgeous (different) EQ setting for THAT guitar. That kind of tinkering may bother some players (personally, I'm okay with it and think the amp's dialed-in tone is worth it). My dream amp is a Fender Deluxe Reverb (which I can't afford) and this is a GREAT alternative for me-- the cleans are beautiful, shimmery when given the right amount of reverb; when it's turned up to just the point of break up and then has a Boss Blues Driver or Tube Screamer added, the dirty channel becomes irrelevant, because this Bugera gets a very satisfying Classic Rock crunch. I love this amp already and I haven't even had a chance to break it in, experiment with mods, etc. Tremendous amp for only $400 (and with the right pedal, the clean channel can do almost anything.) I highly recommend it.                
First, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that zZounds has the best customer service that I've ever encountered. Usually I have trepidation when it comes to speaking to customer service from other businesses. Not so with zZounds.Now for the amplifier. I find that the clean channel on this amp is as good as amps that cost hundreds, if not thousands more. This is my third decade of performing and teaching. I've had valve amps and solid state amps. The V22 Infinium is a great amp for any amount of money. It doesn't blow the windows out, but it has plenty of headroom and volume. I'm looking forward to hooking it up to a 4x12 or 4x10 cabinet. The cleans have that tone that can only be described as multi-dimentional. The dirty channel gives me all the gain I need without going overboard. I'm not a distortion fan, so I don't care that this isn't a metal amp. I'm a Blues fanatic along with loving Jazz/Fusion, and this amp gives me those sounds I've been after.I've had some REALLY good solid state amplifiers, but let's be honest: valve amps are where tonal nirvana is. Valves allow for the inspiration so the artist can freely express him or herself.                
What a great amp. Since receiving it my other amps including Vox, Blackstar, and more have sat idle. Amazing tones from this amp. For the money you won't find a better value. Stop thinking about it and just order one. Zzounds had it to my door in 3 days. This is my new go-to store for all thing musical.                 
I bought my V22 Infinium used, but nearly new. What they say about the tubes is true; mine went out shortly after I began using it and I replaced them with JJs. I also removed the tube cage, which developed a rattle. That involved having to take the speaker out in order to reach the last screws, but it was pretty simple to achieve. Those are the drawbacks. I'd read that these amps have similar sonic characteristics as a Deluxe Reverb and I've found that this one sounds very well in tune with my ' 65 Fender Strat and my ancient Fender Esquire. The sound for my two guitars with humbuckers and P-90s is adequate but to my ears sounds a little harsh without the warm Duane Allman-ish tones I desire. That said, I would not hesitate to make this purchase again. The amp is solid and a huge bang for the buck. Like other reviews I've read, I've found the clean channel to be the champ here. It plays very pretty with my Fenders. Now that I have good tubes in it, I'm very happy with the Bugera and have no regrets. It's so far been reliable and I wouldn't hesitate to do a club gig with it. I also like that I can flip a switch to toss it down to a 20-watt amp. My neighbors across the street probably appreciate that.                
I have been reviewing amps for about a year, because I found myself constantly trying to dial my tone in on my last amp, which just died on me after 4 years. It was an all tube that I purchased new for  around  $600. I chose this Bugera because of the price/features this amp offers. This amp sings!!!! I bought the last one zZounds had in stock at the time and I'm glad I did.                
This could be easily priced for twice as much even being made in Asia.  It is a bright sounding amp, so I recommend presence at half and treble at 10 o'clock along with normal channel used and bright switch out for warmest tone.  
This company makes clones in my opinion of some of the most sought after amps.  The Infinium V Series are copied Fender Hot Rod amps with much better sounding drive channels as far as my assessment goes.  If you're on a budget, this is the head for you.  The one thing disappointed me on the features is that there is no emulated line out for direct input to a mixing board.  Other than that, I'm very satisfied with this purchase                 
I wrote a review a few weeks back when I first got this.  Although I've yet to gig with it, I'm getting more impressed the more I play it.  I was in my studio learning an Allman Bros. song my band is covering and I am matching the guitar tone from the original recording.  I push the amp with a Blues Driver and a clean boost when needed which lets me hold a note forever!  Warm, smooth distortion and great cleans.  So far, I'm amazed at the price Vs. quality.  AMAZING.  All tube and hand built......China made or not...... it's a great product.  I never used any support from Bugera yet, so I'm not sure how to rate that.                  
I was a little hesitant to buy this amp, despite hearing how great it sounds on all the Youtube reviews and videos. Mainly I was concerned about reliability, having read all the hate and bashing of Bugera from several years ago (and that may be justified, I honestly don't know). 
But in the end, 450 bucks for a 55 watt tube amp, that sounds like this, with the features this has, and a footswitch thrown in, persuaded me to take the chance. I figured WORST case I'm out 450 bucks for nothing. 
All I can say after having it for almost 2 weeks so far is, wow, I'm glad I took the chance. The ONLY question in my mind is will it hold up over the long haul. If it does, it deserves 10 out of 10. 
First the tone, which is why I bought it. It is every bit as good as you hear in the reviews. However, I bought JJ tubes and replaced the Chinese made Bugera tubes that came in it, and I could immediately hear a big difference. It is as if that woke it up and it sounds a lot richer with JJs in it. And I can't say it sounded bad with Bugera tubes, it just sounds way better with JJs to my ears. 
Lots of headroom for smooth as glass, then when you nail it, you can hear that tube breakup. As good as some solid states are, I haven't heard one yet that can totally do that as well as a real tube amp (maybe I just haven't heard the right one). Suffice it to say you can go from perfectly clean to really overdriven breakup and anything in between. 
Includes the footswitch, which allows you to turn reverb on and off, and switch channels (clean/high gain) with it. 
Has reverb. I haven't used it too much yet. 
I liked that it's hard wired (even if by some 9 year old Chinese kid). 
I get no noise no hiss no rattles no weird noises that should not be there with mine. The solid state I had previously had some hiss this amp does not. 
As far as looks, it looks great to me. A bit vintage with modern kicked in, the colors and presentation look good to my eyes. 
If I were to pick at anything, it would be of course made in China, but if it were made in the US it would be 3 times the price at least. And the Chinese stock tubes are terrific in my book. But to get a full complement of JJs cost me about 67 bucks. 
Hopefully with the Infinium setup they will last a while. I didn't have to worry about biasing the tubes just put them in. 
And that is easy to do, however you have to remove the metal cage from over them, and they put a bunch of screws (way more than is needed) around that and some are not exactly easy or fun to reach. I found it easiest to turn it upside down for getting that off so the screws didn't come flying down. Going forward I probably won't need to do that. 
In short, to sum up, this does everything I was hoping. It has not disappointed me in any way and if it holds up, it earns a 10 out of 10 rating from me.                 
I wish I had know about the Bugera V55 before I purchased my Vox AC30VR and eventually an AC15C1 because if I did I would have saved a lot of money.Feature that I like:I LOVE the beautiful retro look Build quality is excellent and it sounds even better than it looks.Triode and Pentode mode to cut down the power when you don’t need it.55 watts more than enough power but you can tweak the volume / tone even if you’re just playing in your bedroom. It has a pedal effects loop.Heavy duty foot switch that works well.3 year Mfg. warrantyThis amp is an absolute steal at the price….even a 2-3 times the price.Feature that I don’t like:I wasn’t aware of this amp before I purchased my other amps.none zZounds is great! I purchased this as a scratch and dent for $355. but it arrived in perfect condition with the box and full warranty. This is the second time that I ordered a scratch and dent from them and both amps arrived without any visible issues….just gotta love the deal!Remember to register you amp fro the warranty at:http://www.music-group.com/brand/bugera/support/product-registrationWith any product there can be problems and I can't honestly comment on product support because I never needed it. I hope I never need warranty service but it’s good to know that I’m covered.I can’t say enough good things about this little amp. If you’re on the fence about this amp just get it because you will love it.                
Here we go. zZounds as usual did a great job getting the amp here quickly.  Riding the fence: I opened the box, turned the amp on left it in standby for 20 minutes, about 45 seconds into playing the amp I heard an electrical noise and the fuse blew. Fuses do not blow for no reason. I opened the chassis and one of the 6l6 tubes were damaged. zZounds agreed to send a new tube..excellent customer service. But I needed to gig with he amp before it would get here. I bought a pair of 6L6 tubes and replace both stock tubes. At the gig... the amp performed without flaw. The tone was fantastic and certainly not what you would not expect from a $450.00 amp. It takes effects well and is very dynamic and clear. Please note I never listened to this amp with the stock speaker. I ordered and Eminence Red White and Blues speaker when I ordered the amp and put it in from the rip.  We will see how it holds up in the long term, but as for now I am very pleased with sound.                
I decided after 30 years of playing and never really being able to afford to, I wanted to get a decent all-tube amp.  Not having a huge amount of money to spend on it, i did quite a bit of research on best "budget" tube amps, and came across the V55.  Not being able to find only locally or even remotely close to me to test in person, i had to rely on various reviews and demos on the YouTube, and i was still a little bit hesitant to purchase the amp, but finding it on sale at another site, and getting a price match from zZounds, convinced me to pull the trigger.  I am so glad that i did.  This amplifier is beautiful.  i love to look at it.  It reminds me of the upholstery in a 50's Cadillac or Chevy.  The sound is amazing.  i love the "glassy" sound if gives my Jimmy Vaughan Strat. The gain channel is plenty fat and dirty for what i do, and will certainly get dirtier.  I find myself pulling out my cheap Yamaha Pacifica a lot more now to use the humbucker in the bridge because of how great the gain channel sounds.  I haven't spend this much time practicing Van Halen riffs since high school, and its because i love the tone of this amp.  I've seen it compared to a Fender Hot Rod deluxe, and i think that is a fair comparison.  I have a friend who has one, and while i love his tone, I'll take this one over his any day of the week.                  
I admit I was hesitant about buying this amp without hearing it first and with the bad reviews Bugera used to get.  But all the current reviews I read were saying how great it was and what a bargain so I took a chance.  I was very surprised and impressed right off the bat. Beautiful amp and built like a tank. I don't gig but I wouldn't want to carry it around to gigs, very heavy.  The sound is amazing both clean and gain. The side of the amp has a small nick in it but it's very small and doesn't bother me.  zZounds has great service and fast shipping, I love these guys!! I am very happy with this amp and would say if your borderline on it, go ahead, you won't be disappointed!                 
This is my first all tube guitar amp. I have 2 brand name solid state amps, the first is 25 watts and never could make it sound right, I have a 100 watt half stack that I do like manly due to the effects built in.  The Bugera, I love it. The build quality is great, very solid and no rattles when playing. The equalizer works wonderfully to get the tone you want. The clean channel is just that, a crisp clean sound and then switch on the gain and WOW, what a nice sound. I have 3 distortion pedals and none sounded as good as the gain on this amp. I have used the turbosound speaker built in and connected my 4-12 cabinet and again, WOW it sounds great. The reverb sounds nice if you know how to use it because it is powerful and the pentode/triode switch not only increase or decreases output but gives you a whole new set of tools to set up the amp. I tried many amps both solid state and all tube but this Bugera just works for me, I can't think of anything bad to say about it.                
My weapon of choice through the years has been Twin Reverb Reissues. I know that sound. It'll be in my head forever. I know how to dial that tone up on any good amplifier. Now what you get with this amp is bonifide tube tone with eq adjustments that you can make work for almost any situation. The dirty channel IMHO is more of a overdrive versus a 'over the top' metal channel. Which is more realistic as most will add pedals to taste. Now, as for value? You won't beat it for the price, plain and simple. Get a blemished model, your just going to use it anyway and zZounds will be giving you superior service through your acquisition!                
It's really a crying shame Bugera doesn't invest in a bit of quality consciousness. The product looks great. I've heard tell it sounds really good. Yet after unpacking my new V55INFINIUM, I plugged it in. I let it warm up. Plugged in a guitar, flicked the switch and.....POP! Blew a fuse. I boxed it back up and sent it to zZounds for a quick refund.                
Some categorize the tone as "muddy" and "dark". I found it to be to my liking, not too dark or muddy. But tone is a personal preference, to each his own. The reverb, being digital, is not all that bad. I have a Vox AC15 C2 with a AC30 true spring reverb tank in it...no comparison there, of course, but my Vox Night Train has a digital reverb in her which is rather nice. I would say this one is not much different to that one. I was able to coax really nice over driven tones from this amp. More blues/classic rock than metal. I never tried pedals on this amp, so no comment there.                
The best feature is the attenuator. That was my main reason for choosing this amp. I wanted a lower watt amp. It was between this and the Vox 4 watt model with an attenuator. This amp was almost half the price and had a gain control.                
Prior to it's "melt down", I was able to get really great tones from this lil' amp. Dialing in the sound you want was easy and I could foresee the .1 watt being a useful tool for late night home practice.                
It felt like it was well made. Great looking, The vinyl covering looked and felt like high end leather. The handle was sturdy and I believe it was made of leather. I felt it would be around in my collection for years. Had it not been for the static/buzzing issue, I'd be playing her right now.                
I hope mine was just a fluke and the rest of you get a issue free model. If so, I know you'll enjoy this amp. No other all tube amp with these features is any where near this value. Hell, I still want to give her another try someday. I'm sure mine was just a bad egg in the bunch. Or, I'll just get another Vox!                
I did not contact them with my issue, just promptly returned it to zZounds.                
The "Wow" factor is the classic good looks and the beefy tones you'll get!                
I really wanted to love this amp, yet sadly after just a few days of ownership, it began to act up. This amp looks great and feels as though it's built really well; solid construction, "leather-like" vinyl covering, classic "chicken head" knobs. This initial tones I was able to get out of her were very much to my liking and I looked forward to getting her broke in and hearing how much better she would sound over time. Yet one afternoon while playing, it began to have a loud static sound, for no reason. I turned it off and then on again with no luck. Then, as mysteriously as it began, it slowly faded away. I continued to play with no more static. Cut to a few days later. it happened again, only more aggressively. Not wanting to take a chance, I decided to just begin the return process while she was still new. I still feel a bit saddened since I really wanted to love this lil' amp.                
WOW! I can't believe how good this thing sounds. Driving tube tone at a volume that won't wake up the whole household. The reverb sounds amazing. I haven't hooked up any pedals yet. I also haven't had to ask for manufacturer support. All in all, I would say to someone who is considering buying this amp, "What are you waiting for?"                
Not nearly as "Dark" as I have read, I think that Bugera may have made some mods to this amp since it first came out. I like the tone a lot, personally, the gain is about perfect and if not over-saturated the reverb works well. It is digital reverb but does not color the tube tone, so its acceptable to add a tiny bit of chime and air to the overall tone. I have only tried to use a big muff pedal on it and was not at all impressed with how it took pedals. I would however, like to be able to add Trem to the tone. Maybe a better quality pedal will sound better not sure.Also, I do use this to driver a 112 cabinet. The bigger speaker sounds much better than the 8 inch in the combo, however, as far as 8'' speakers go, it is usable in a small venue or for practice. I like the power attenuation ability, however at 1 watt and .5 watt I do believe the tone suffers a lot, so I don't use them much. I have heard more expensive amps and they do not have this problem. I guess all-in-all for 200 bucks cant be beat!                
I picked this little guy up and wow.  First off its under to 200 dollar price point.  Second, its a class A tube beauty.  The tone on this thing is better than some small boutique amps I have played on (VHT, Fender, Handmade).  It's got a great clean tone when you want it, and an awesome filthy gritty tube tone when you want it.  The attenuator is bada** for practicing, and the headphone jack works like a charm as well.  I can't comment on the self biasing properties yet as I just got it, but I can say the stock tubes are not bad.  I've had worse.  If you're on the line, get it.  You won't regret it.  I also want to comment on the fit and finish.  This thing looks amazing.  It feels amazing and it plays amazing.                  
this thing sounds nice! dial up the gain at full and at 5 watts with vol under 1 and you have a nice breakup sound ..add some pedals and this little amp will surprise your ears                
This amp gets mic'd up at band practice and it really sounds great..the other guitar player had a solid state amp and this thing is so noticeably warmer sounding..I use a overdrive and a delay pedal with it for some grit and  lead delay..for it's price it is the best home amp i have seen also..so nice not to have to lug around big nice amps to get to rehearsal                 
Great practice amp.  Perfect for bedroom practice sessions.....
Simple, well made, and ready to fill the room with tube warmth and 
acceptable volume levels.                
Man, where do I start? I love this amp. I bought it because I didn't want to spend a lot, but I also missed the sound of a clean guitar in a tube amp. This amp is amazing. The cleans are perfect and crystal clear. I play a lot of blues and this amp is perfect for blues. I put an Ibanez TS9 Tube Screamer in the front of the dirty channel and it gives plenty of bite. This amp is one of the best cheap tube amps I have ever played. If you're looking at buying it, do it!!!                
Opened the box and wow, first thing I noticed is the packaging.. Comes in a smart aluminum hard shell case which foam lined to protect the Mic and shockmount.. The mic is in its own wooden box.. When I opened the box, ok I had my second WOW!  This mic is not only gorgeous, it is very solidly constructed and it is much larger than I imagined..   Enough on the eye candy,  Later today, I set it up in front of my Alvarez acoustic guitar and recorded my first cut with no EQ and just set the mic about 10 inches in front of the sound hole.. not very scientific I know but just the same I got a gorgeous sound with no EQ on playback..   I heard bass response from my Alvarez I had never knew existed.. and the harmonics just rang out so pure.. 
Then it was time to do some real world work, and with the help of my engineer, we cut a VO for a video I am working on.. once again, no EQ in or out and my voice over was full and also had plenty of clarity, a must in a voice over.. 
I will likely buy another soon!  Get one or you just have to blame yourself for buying a Neumann U 87 for mega cash..  when you can get this kind of sound for under $500.                
These microphones sound amazing. I researched ribbon microphones for several months before deciding on these. The price to quality ratio is very high. They are passive ribbons with somewhat low output. I pair them with the Cloudlifter CL-2 mic activator dumpimping into two Presonus Tube Pre V2 tube preamps. The warmth and detail of the sound on vocals and acoustic guitars is stunning. I look forward to using these exquisite mics more in the next several months on drums and electric guitar cabinets.
Also, the included shock mounts and Stereo mounting bar with instructions on the Blumlein stereo miking technique and a great added value. This adds a great 260 3D sound to my recordings. Kudos Cascade.
I recently ordered a keyboard stand and seat for my Casio keyboard. Everything works well, except that the keyboard stand does no sit level. It may have been because the box it and the seat were packed in was a little too small. The box the stand was in stuck out about 3-4 inches from the packing box, and showed some signs of being hit.                
Really like this Casio Piano Bench. The padding is thin, but it's very comfortable, and is very sturdy.                
Just finished a professional stage production review based upon specific music styles of Broadway Show Tunes, here in Florida. Because of the fact that some songs had to be pitched based upon each singer's range, the plus/minus buttons for the transposer were indispensable. Add to that, at all times there is an on screen indication of where the keyboard is currently pitched without having to push a button to find out. Brilliant CASIO!!                
i started lessons as a child but never finished.  so this piano is the one i recently purchased to learn as an adult and it's great. do not expect dynamics or sound quality of a real piano because this doesn't have that, but it is jam packed with a lot of features and is perfect for learning how to play.                 
As an owner of a Roland keyboard and Yamaha digital piano, I was reluctant to purchase a Casio; however, I wanted a light, portable keyboard with decent sound on a budget.  The Casio CTK-6200 met this need.  This keyboard is an excellent value and provides a lot of features for a keyboard player on a budget.  For example, the sequencer offers a lot of features, but...it is a bit clunky to navigate.  While this keyboard has a 32 channel mixer, it is difficult to quickly navigate through the channels on it; however, for under $200, the aforementioned features are and excellent value.  Nonetheless, Roland or Yamaha offer far better options for sequencing and mixing.  I have done a few gigs with this Casio keyboard due to its portability.  It should be noted that the onboard speakers are "cheap" sounding.  To get the best performance, this keyboard needs a sustain pedal AND should be run through an external sound system.  As a keyboard player that plays on worship teams, I found the default piano samples were very tinny, but...I used the tone editor to provide additional reverb, attack, and more "punch" to the piano tones.  The fact that the tones can be editted increases the value of this keyboard.  Overall, Casio makes a GOOD keyboard - not a GREAT keyboard.  For a GREAT keyboard, be prepared to invest a minimum of $1,000 for a Yamaha, Roland, or a Korg.  For a novice player or for a band keyboard player looking for a good keyboard on a budget, the Casio CTK-6200 is a decent choice.                
Reminds me of the old Ensoniq composition keyboards. Wonderful for song writing guitarists. The biggest obstacle is it is not midi and there is no way to make it midi.                
purchased as gift for daughter.. she's happy. I'm happy.  Review by Rating:
SOUND:  speakers could be a little better.. sounds really plastic and shallow.
FEATURES:  loaded. great entry level into sequencing a song or track.
EASE OF USE: not that ease for a novice.. but great learning tool to get started.
QUALITY: PLastic all the way around. Light weight. but not for alot of portablility. I wouldn't take it out the house.
VALUE: ZZounds is great, but for the price i'm not sure. depends on your needs.
MANUFACTURES SUPPORT:  Haven't had to use yet.
THE WOW FACTOR:  My daughters face when she opened her gift. AS far as that.. the features are packed.. USB a major plus
OVERALL: 3.5 stars.:
If your looking for a entry level sequencing board that pulls double duty.. this isn't too bad. If you have any experience with on-board sequencing.. then shell out another $200-$400 and upgrade to Yamaha or Korg.. or just convert to MIDI Controler and Computer for longevity.  
Would i recommend to a friend?
For entry level or beginner sequencing = YES
If experienced at any level = NO
Bought a blemished piece and I can't even tell where the blemish is. Came in well packaged and delivered as promised. 
The keyboard itself is great for people who are either beginners or have lost touch and trying to catch up after a long time. The quality of the build is nice and the sound quality is decent. It is a great value at this price.
Will definitely recommend. 
The Casio LK-280 has so many features that compare with keyboards at 4 times the price. The voices and rhythms sound good, and the lighted keys make it very easy to start playing right out of the box. I really like the SD card slot. I can play midi files from the card or save my music to the card and edit on the computer.                
Great sound. Good volume controls. Touch sensitive keys work great. Works great in different settings. Different sounds (drums, flute, organ, ect) work great. Sounds good. Light up keys work perfectly. And def help.                
So far the keyboard is easy to use. Def have to read instructions. Bunch of buttons and different features. Pretty easy once you know what your doing. Haven't hooked up MIDI cable yet. So I'm not sure how easy it is to download more songs.                
Seems pretty sturdy. Seems like it will last a long time. Doesn't feel flimsy and cheap.                
Everything about this transaction was terrific! I brought a blemished keyboard. Can't even tell where a blemish is. Works perfectly! Worth the price. Great product. Fast shipping. Would gladly do it again. Thanx zzsounds!! :)                
While not the best sounding Casio keyboard, it does have its niche. I bought this for my girlfriend and the great thing about this is that she loves to play it. Even though she is not very good it makes her feel like she is really playing and she has fun doing it. The lighted keys makes it simple for anyone to play and it has a good selection of songs. This is a great keyboard for a beginner to get their feet wet on.                
Love the LK-280 keyboard! Only suggestion is to have "Grand Piano" deeper and richer. Fantastic shipping from ZZounds - in time for Christmas!                
I am completely satisfied with my purchasing experience with zZounds. The quality of the piano was much more than expected. I'm still discovering tones and sound this model makes. The bag was also well made as was the stand and sustain pedal I purchased.                
I am new to playing keys and have been playing on a low line Yamaha with bad action. When I looked for a better one, I looked real hard to find something in the $500 with great action, versatility, and could hook to my DAW. This is very much what I was looking for. All details I wanted are there. The hammer action thumps a bit, I am not sure if that is normal, but I fixed the problem by turning up the volume.                
The Casio PX-350 relies on both the Tri-Sensor Scaled Hammer Keyboard and the AiR which means acoustic & intelligent resonator. These to features combined produce an unprecedented sound and feel that wasn’t seen before in a keyboard that can be purchased less than 1k. All of the piano sounds are great, but some of the other 250 tones are hit or miss. The beauty of having Midi or USB Midi is you get pretty much unlimited amount of tones. As stated earlier the on-board speakers sound great as long as you stay under the max volume (the highest I go is about ¾ the way) then you lose a bit of dynamics and in some cases may experience speaker popping. Audio recorded to an USB Flash drive sounds amazing. It will produce a Wav file, but I noticed that the volume is tad on the low side so I suggest normalizing it using an Audio application such as Audacity. Audio through a PA or amps sound great as well.                
There are so many features on this digital piano that makes it way more valuable than it is priced.                
Overall it is fairly easy to use...                 
The Casio PX-350 is built for the traveling performer, it is light weight and easy to travel with. The built in speakers are sufficient for playing in small to medium sized room without the need for amplification. I congratulate Casio for making it look and feel less like a toy, but I guess that goes for all of their Privia line instruments. I love that they put a Standard USB port on the front of the Keyboard that will allow you to plug in an External Hard Drive or a flash drive to record audio to in either WAV or MIDI format. I also found this port to be useful for charging devices like my tablet or phone or power them while I'm lead sheet reading. It is also very useful for plugging in USB lights and fans. On the downside I don’t really like that they placed the headphone jacks on the back of the instrument. The front or even the side would have been more practical if you ask me. I have also noticed that over time the keys seem to make more noise than when I first got it especially my F# 1 key…                
This is a awesome Digital Piano and i highly recommend it.

There are many digital pianos less than 1K but not many are as feature packed as the Casio Privia PX-350. Are there ones with more features? Yes, but in end they are seriously lacking in other areas. You are getting the real deal when you purchase this instrument. The Sound it produces is very dynamic and expressive, that is rare to find in digital pianos less than 1k. The synthetic Ebony and Ivory feel is unheard of in digital pianos under $2500. Normally Casio is playing catch up in the digital piano game but as of late they have been a step ahead of the game and raising the bar enough to make it competitors nervous. I’m Curious to see how Yamaha will answer to this. Their last Digital piano in this class was the Yamaha P155 which is still a beast in its own right but it is starting to look a bit dated.                
Awesome! It is perhaps the best word to describe the new Casio Privia PX 350.
Having researched many hours and having read countless reviews I decided to buy this fantastic Digital Stage Piano. I was right! The most amazing is the realism and the hammer action of the piano, particularly the Grand Piano , in my opinion has better pianos than the  Roland RD700NX , Kurzweil SP4-8 or even Nord pianos !!!!
The design is minimalist ,his intuitive  banking system is perfectly  friendly to use. Casio engineers did amazing work to emulate the hammer action of the keys very very close to a real acoustic Grand Piano.
If you are looking primarily a quality piano as his first priority then the Casio Privia PX 350 is the best choice in the price range below $ 1,500. The sound of the instrument is really appreciated in all its dimensions when it connects to the headphone, mixer or amplifier,  as built-in speakers do not have enough output.
It is important to clarify that the Casio Privia PX 350 is not a Digital Arranger, despite having 250 tones and a 17-track sequencer that will be of great use to translate good ideas of all the music you want to create and play.
Bottle line for the price it has no rival , you don't need to be a scientist to know is good , just listen to believe
PD : ZZOUNS GREAT JOB , YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST                 
I have had almost all the big names in keyboards/piano's over my 30 + years of being in music and hands down this is one of the best sounding and playing pianos. It just has the right feel of being as close to authentic of a real piano as any I have played and I like the texture and bounce of the keys, it just feels right. I currently own a high end Korg and a Roland as well but they have been getting lonely since I bought this Casio and I spent a bunch less money on the Casio as well.  I only have one big complaint and it's simply the damper pedal they send with the keyboard is pretty much junk, meaning that although it works as a damper pedal, it's so light it's nearly impossible to keep it from creeping away from your foot while playing.  The only replacement that Casio mentions in it's manual is a sp 33 (with it's associated stand and three pedals).  Now if you simply are playing the piano at home that would work fine but if your gigging it's another piece of gear to haul around.  After extensive searching on the internet and forums, no one was able to give any concrete ideas on a alternate single damper pedal.  I even called zZounds and the representative at zZounds couldn't help me either.  My email to Casio was no help either, so there you go.  But all in all it's a great piano I wished the electric piano sounds were a bit more in-depth and sounded more authentic but that is a personal thing.  Eventually I will work out the pedal problem and overall it's a rather small issue.                
The PX350 is a great board at a great price.  The finger-sound-brains connection is great.  I use it in a rig along with a Yamaha MOX.   
The built in speakers allows me to "feel" the piano just as if I were playing my acoustic grand at home.
Despite what the manual says, the sound from the line outs to FOH is perfectly fine while simultaneously having the speakers on.  No need to plug the headphone jack to silence them when running to FOH at a gig.
The piano sounds are wonderful!   Organs need help, but that's not why I bought the board.
Overall quality is great, and at 25lbs, it's easy on my old back at load in and load out.                
This was given as a gift to my 18 y/o as a Christmas gift. He is a gifted musician--self-taught on guitar and played several years of trumpet. He loves this instrument and is picking up playing very quickly. Another child of ours is associated with a local music school that has 3-4 Casio 150's and the owner swears by their dependability. We are very pleased with the new piano and zZounds as well--fast delivery, excellent communication and tremendously competitive value.                
I purchased this keyboard after doing a lot of research and I am very satisfied with the way it performs. This is not just a practice piano as another reviewer suggested. This is a workstation with features that you would find on a a keyboard twice the price of this one. Sounds are divided into separate banks (piano, organ, strings, etc.) which you can easily scroll through with up and down buttons. You can also create your own sounds and store them. I have no problems using the keyboard at gigs unlike a previous reviewer. Buttons are logically laid out for easy access. Most of the sounds are pretty awesome but I have found some that I like to tweak at the PA mixing board. Keys have good responsive weighted action and have the feel of ivory not plastic (really nice especially if your hands sweat). You won't find a comparable keyboard for under $1500.00. Get this one, you won't be sorry.                
Not only was the delivery made fast and swift, but the music that comes out of the PX350 is "OMG" without a huge budget, now I can experience the sound and "feel" the keys on this Piano like nothing i've had . Thanks for making it easier on the small studio zZounds.                
I have owned a few Casio keys and the feel never inspired me to play much. When purchasing an instrument most musicians will admit how it feels is just as important as how it sounds. (The moment I placed my fingers on it to begin playing, I grew the biggest smile) The weighted keys feel just like a standard piano, though you have the ability to adjust tone and volume like a keyboard. I really enjoy playing my Priva. I recommend it for anyone who wants to enjoy the sound of a grand without taking up all the space. Oh and it's really pretty too. :) Money well spent!!                
I chose this keyboard entirely by online reviews, and could not be happier. It was unreal to choose a Casio over a Yamaha- but it is easy to see why this keyboard received the highest ratings!                
My church purchased this piano about 3 months ago to replace an OLD 67 key, organ touch Casio that was just bad. After reading a lot of reviews for several different pianos on various websites, we decided to pull the trigger on the PX-350.Sounds:This piano sounds are very nice after a bit of EQ. We don't use the organ sounds much. The synth sounds are pleasant and have a wide variety of tonal characteristics for multiple genres. The string and pad sounds are OK at best. When using this piano through a PA mono (which is how a 'stage piano' will be used 99% of the time) the low end on almost every patch has a very noticeable pulsing sound at about 80Hz and below. This drives our sound tech CRAZY. I suspect (and this is only a guess) that all the patches are designed to be stereo and the 'pulsing' is a result of mono summing.Weight, Touch & Feel:The overall weight of the keyboard is extremely 'gig' friendly. Very light and compact; easily fits into the back seat of a car. That being said, the piano is not very deep and has a hard time sitting correctly on a standard piano stand. We had a carpenter in our church cut us a board that is about 14" deep and the same length as the PX-350. We set the board on the stand, then the piano on the board to keep the piano from sliding around. The weight of the keys is nice and feels as natural as semi-weighted keys can. For some reason (and I'm still trying to figure this one out), instead of a smooth plastic finish on the keys like EVERYONE else has, Casio decided to imprint the keys with a 'wood grain' pattern that feels awkward and extremely unnatural to play! Myself and the other pianists at church have had tough time adjusting to it.Features:Too many buttons! When we first opened the PX-350, my first thought was "Crud! I'm going to have to spend an entire afternoon just reading the manual!" You cannot create presets and assign them to a punch button. You can store them in a bank, but you must hit the up or down arrows and scroll through every other sound in a bank to get to the one you're looking for. Layering sounds is quite difficult and NOT something you can do on the fly in a live situation; we tried and it went horribly wrong. While there are a lot of sounds to choose from, most of them are not realistic enough to be used in a live situation. There are buttons for all kinds of recording, playing, drum beats, and everything else you can think of; most of them completely useless for a live playing situation. I suppose if you're a one-man-band, or a solo artist you may find these useful.Overall, this is at best a PRACTICE piano, not a professional stage piano. Ultimately, our church is in the process of building a new building and we will keep this piano as a backup or put it in a classroom. When it comes time to buy another, I imagine we'll go with a KORG, Yamaha, or Roland.                
Excellent piano action, very good to excellent sound limited by built in speakers.  Touch screen makes navigating easy.  At price point, nothing compared.
Primarily, I use it for practicing piano lessons with headphone when acoustic upright cannot be played. My kids use it in their piano studies and band.
Pro...too many to list.  Outside of Kawai MP11 or maybe ES8, nothing close at 2 to three times price
Cons..Tough to keep reading about entry level keyboard, yamaha superiority, Roland and Kawai better, etc.  Enough to make me question purchase until I play it  again.                
OVERALL:
I purchased the PX-560 in 2017 and I have owned it for several months. I wanted to play it and become familiar with it before writing a somewhat detailed review. First of all, everything about the PX-560 is excellent. There is not a bad sound on this instrument anywhere. Every keyboard manufacturer has their interpretation of what a grand piano sounds like and what a B-3 sounds like and they are similar, but different. At a certain level, the sounds of every quality keyboard built by every manufacturer are good. Again, different, but good. This is very much similar to the argument that guitarists have had for decades; Gibson Les Paul, Fender Stratocaster, or Ibanez Steve Vai. All are great guitars, but different. If the player wants warm and creamy sounds, the Les Paul may be the guitar of choice. Those seeking some twang and bite might opt for the Stratocaster. The shredder guitarist will most likely prefer the Steve Vai. The high-end version of each of these guitars is of excellent build quality but each has unique elements that makes them different. The same is true of electronic pianos and other electronic keyboards..
I was in the market for a high quality piano when I decided to be open minded and look at and play as many keyboards as I could and what I discovered was that the PX-560 can't be beat for the money spent for any keyboard. Certainly, it has it's nuances that make it different from competitors' keyboards costing substantially more and, like any keyboard built by any of Casio's competitors, it has its limitations but overall the PX-560 is excellent. Secondly, it is very important to keep in mind that it is necessary to spend some time learning how to navigate through all the features of this keyboard in order to fully appreciate everything the PX-560 is capable of delivering and delivering well.
FEATURES:
I am not sure what Casio was trying to achieve with the PX-560 but it seems as if the design engineers at Casio did all their homework. Was it intended to be a piano, synthesizer, organ, or multi-sounding keyboard? I'm still not sure but the PX-560 is absolutely loaded with a ton of useful features and sounds that will allow the keyboardist to make it their only keyboard. It is a great piano with excellent synthesizer sounds, fantastic strings, very good organs, very good horns, and tons of other sounds that are all somewhere between very good and excellent. Certainly, as with any keyboard, there is a required learning curve but that is no different from any of the keyboards built by Casio's competitors. And just like any keyboard, it will take some getting familiar with. The built in speakers are an added plus.
QUALITY:
I have had this instrument for several months and I have no complaints or issues with the build quality or sound quality. Everything about it is excellent. The manufactured ebony and ivory feel of the keys will take some getting used to. I still have Roland and Yamaha keyboards that I purchased in 1985 so I hope it lasts as long as those. If you are a gigging or traveling musician, I would strongly recommend a decent hard case and not a gig bag!!
MANUFACTURER SUPPORT:
Have not needed to contact the manufacturer for anything other than to register the product.  
SOUND:
There is not a bad sound on the PX-560 anywhere. Everything sounds somewhere between very good and excellent. Again, every manufacturer has their interpretation of what a grand piano sounds like and what different instruments sound like but this is subjective to individual tastes. I am very pleased with all the sounds on this instrument. There are a number of ethnic sounds and other sounds that I may never use and some sounds that I do not like but the choices make the PX-560 even more versatile than competitors' keyboards costing much more. Also, the ability to layer sounds and control the nuances of every voice of the layered sound is a great feature. The keyboard split function makes it reasonably simple to split the keyboard into desired sounds with an adjustable split point. Cool! 
EASE OF USE:
Like any musical instrument, it requires some time to get familiar with. A little patience is necessary to take advantage of all that this keyboard will do. I am still discovering some things about this keyboard. The owner's manual is well written and It is important to read the owner's manual first. It will save a lot of time.
VALUE:
After substantial research and playing keyboards by other manufacturers, I have not found, and do not believe, any other manufacturer can get close to offering all the features and sounds for the same amount of money. The PX-560 is the best 'bang for the buck' on the market. Roland, Korg, Yamaha, Kurzweil, and Nord are all costing more and substantially more for similar features. The only limitation is that it does not sample. I would have been willing to pay more for a keyboard with this many features that had sampling capability but all I wanted was a real good piano and what I ended up with was so much more. A great buy!
THE WOW FACTOR:
I have played keyboards for more than 30 years. I have owned Yamaha (DX7, SY77, SY85), Roland (Juno 106, DS88, FA-06, EP-50), Hammond (SK-2) and all are still going strong. The PX-560 is a surprisingly great keyboard. I would highly recommend the PX-560 to any keyboardist seeking a great piano or a keyboard that will do everything pretty well except sampling. I was not disappointed. After reading this somewhat lengthy review I hope it proves helpful. I paid full price for this keyboard and I do not work for, or own stock, in Casio. zZounds made purchasing this keyboard a truly pleasant experience. I will purchase more from zZounds in the future. The Casio PX-560 can't be beat (maybe with a stick, perhaps). Those who decide to purchase one of these instruments will not be disappointed. Read the owner's manual and take the time to learn your way around it.                
I'm still familiarizing with all the many features of this machine. LOTS of voices and features to enhance performance, and, like all such instruments, a fairly steep learning curve. But some features seem like they were designed by programmer/engineers, rather than musicians. So far, my biggest disappointment is that the user can't name the stored registrations -- that is, songs -- (you get 96 slots for them). If you're in a concert situation, you have to list your songs and their locations elsewhere(!), even though you can key in titles under the pre-packaged "User Presets" category. Really inconvenient!                
THIS IS A FABULOUS DIGITAL PIANO!! Fantastic piano sounds, and the ability to customize the sounds, adds amazing flexibility. I have both a Casio CGP-700 and the 560. THERE IS NO COMPARISON as to the piano sounds!! And the inclusion of a modulation wheel on the 560 makes many of the "tones" sound so much better! For the money there is no better digital piano out there- NONE!                
This is in my opinion the best Stage Piano for the money! The piano sound is excellent, and the ability to modify the parameters just adds to the quality. No other digital piano in this price range even comes close! It's expressive, and full sounding and yet can be played as fast as you can work the keys, very impressive. The strings are outstanding, and the ability to assign functions to the K-1 to K-3 rotary knobs adds greatly to live performances. You would have to spend 2-4 times as much to beat this piano!                
Lightweight keyboard with fantastic weighted action, that was enough but there's so much more! Lovely piano with undetectable samples and smooth dynamic response, everything you need as a controller too, very satisfied with this purchase!!!                
This is a wonderful digital piano - touch wise, sound wise, appearance-wise, pretty much everything.  I use it as my main keyboard onstage and also record with it because the sounds are very clean.  It replaced a much heavier Roland keyboard that couldn't put up with the Florida humidity - hopefully this one will do better!!  Only things I critique are the layering, splitting, and transposing functions because they are not as quickly accessed, which can be tricky onstage if you need them.  That design should have followed other manufacturers.  Overall, though, a great keyboard.                
This is a great value and a great piano. Not only does it, out of the box, do pretty much everything I need it to do as a worship leader, there is so much more I haven't even looked into yet. The concert grand piano is great and especially for what I do, the Ballad Piano with the layered strings is phenomenal. I love that there is such a community of users for this stage piano! There are tutorials, clinics hosted by Casio, and a whole user forum where you can get pretty much any question answered. Definitely worth the price!                
Casio has always been a great designer of sound engines - What they've given here is incredible sound PLUS the ability to model your own sounds with great flexibility.  I've been around keyboards and studio equipment for thirty years and I am still in awe when play synth chords from this keyboard that reverberate my soul....Piano, organ, love the clavs with the pedal action for the clav/wah sounds....synths are amazing and so customizable...these are my favorite - love the kick drum sounds as well.....very deep with the quality of hip hop/mpc flavor.
This keyboard comes with presets that have been tweaked and tweaked until they are their most presentable and usable (as evidenced by Casios Mike Martin via Youtube and his continuing sound uploads).....They aren't the presets you "delete right away because youre a purist sound modeling expert".                
The most useful feature to me is the ease of finding the sound I want without touching the next button 439 times as is often the case when given an overwhelming amount of options (producers who have hundreds of thousands of samples to look through/choose from can appreciate this as well as those who just want to pick out the "right" sound)......The PX5S gives you the option to select tones that are compatible with the type instrument you want as well as the 100 stage settings that may comprise several different sounds.  
I have noticed some people being dismayed for the lack of a sheet music stand or holder - If this was a requirement for me and I didn't buy this keyboard for that reason It would be one of my biggest nonpurchase failures.....buy a stand - get creative - do something else but don't let it be the reason you don't buy this keyboard.                
The presets already give you a great place to begin.  Sounds can be tailored easily to your liking and needs.  Ease of use with other products: the connectivity options make compatibility a no brainer - The only thing I bought extra was an apple camera connectivity kit to connect my ipad to the keyboard so I could select stage setting via the app "set list maker" as seen in some Casio PX5S review videos via youtube.
Learning curve - The Casio manual is basic, but is designed to acquaint you with control/selection operations.  Then their is the Casio tutorial manual - a deeper look into what the keyboard is capable of and how to do it.  Both are to the point but neither gets you where you feel you've passed the learning curve.  You must - in my opinion be prepared to jump into the youtube tutorials (specifically Mike Martins Clinic #1 and Clinic #2) in order to feel you can now see the light.... - learn that there are settings not only for each "tone" but for each stage setting that may comprise several tones - examples would be compression, eq, filters, pitch variations, etc.....                
The product is made exceptionally well - I wasn't sure how id like the key "feel" after reviews often talked about them being different than synth or other keyboards but I found it was because these keys feel "real" with the way they're designed/made versus the plastic crap we find ourselves accustomed to.  I like them very much and they add to the "make me want to touch it" criteria.  I don't like the knob design as there isn't a visual indicator from my vantage point of playing to indicate where the knob is adjusted.......I did however add small Swarovski crystals to the center indicator of each knob to give me a visual reference.   The crystals are very small but refract the smallest amount of light so I can always glance and see where theyre adjusted.                
I could see this keyboard doubled or tripled in price easily.  A Steal..... I didn't think id every drop this much cash on a Casio but like many people I was blinded by the glitz and glimmer of the lit pads and other nonsense on much lesser abled keyboards.  Casio is underrated and underpromoted in my opinion.  Genres that rely on midi keyboards with pads, etc need to look at this keyboard instead (hiphop, pop, r&b, funk)                
I have not had a reason to deal with the company but would consider the support via Casios Mike Martin on youtube to be an industry best as far as manufacturer support goes for teaching their product.  You cant have this keyboard and not watch his "how to" videos on youtube.                
Knowing what it does is the wow factor.  However - it isn't as sexy as other keyboards.  the white and blue seems a throwback to early small casio days. Ive seen several that were "customized" and in my opinion its a great canvas for that.  Best that Casio spent its resources on sound and possibilities than trying to appeal to the "all show no go" crowd.                 
My buying criteria: 
1 - midi compatible for home studio use
2 - 88 key - preferably hammered keybed
3 - professional level sound engine and sound modeling ability
4 - Dual purpose keyboard - one I could sit down and flesh out ideas or play - and one that was the main keyboard for my DAW (Ableton Live 9 Suite)
5 - SUPPORT!!!!! - ie - video tutorials - something to ease the learning curve
6 - I had to know I was the owner of a bad ass keyboard - had to feel it every day     when I woke and looked at it.....I wanted it to make me want to touch it.....
This keyboard compliments my:
Home studio which is comprised of Ableton Live 9 Suite and Ableton Push midi controller.  
I previously have owned and am experienced with:
1: full size upright piano
2: Akai mpk 61
3: Casio wk 210 
4: Yamaha keyboard 
5: various midi controllers/pads/interfaces
There are 2 things I do:
1.  Sit down whenever I feel like it, turn on the PX5S and just jam, flesh out ideas that will go to the DAW later (which I can record to jumpdrive as im jamming) or just experiment with the vast amount of possiblites in sound design/modeling.....
2.  Turn on my Digital Audio Workstation (Ableton Live) and, with my keyboard connected via USB, create tracks with any virtual instruments I have access to via my computer - as well as loading the WAV files I recorded from my actual keyboard jam sessions - 
I will probably never use this keyboard as a "stage keyboard" as I don't actively play in a band or entertain.  I create and produce within the confines of my home studio.  for this - the Casio PX5S has been incredible.  Its Data Editor that can be downloaded for free opens on your windows or mac computer and with the opening of it you can see each parameter on the keyboard and its possible settings.....new sounds can be downloaded from a very solid user group online and easily loaded to your keyboard via this editor (by use of usb cable from keyboard to computer) or via your jump drive that can move information to and from the keyboard.  The possibilities are endless with this keyboard that has no competition in the below 2-3K price range.  
I'm a 30 year guitar player but pretty much no piano experience. I bought this piano to learn on. I have dabbled with pianos on and off and to start, the keys feel amazing. I have had really good piano player friends say the same thing.  I've messed with some of the extras but honestly I wouldn't really know how well they work until I get some ivory tickling time under my belt. 
I gave features less than 5 based on my lack of knowledge about electronic pianos in general.
I gave quality less than 5 because, while the keys feel amazing and it sounds great, it does not feel like it could take much of a beating. I'm guessing they had to compromise on build quality to make the keys and other features more affordable. Don't beat it up is all I can say ;)
Also I havent had to contact Casio so I gave it 5 because I didn't want to give it 1 and it won't let me NOT choose.
Overall, after having it a few weeks, I am more than happy with the purchase and of course, zZounds payment plans are great!                
I have to admit imho the sounds of this keyboard are still a little shy of the quality of some of the others that have dominated the professional scene for many years, but Casio has come light years beyond what they used to sound like and I have no qualms whatsoever about using it along side of them or by itself. It may be that if I take the time to really learn how to modify the sounds to my liking it would be every bit as satisfying, but I tend to use stock sounds out the box and usually trade up to something else before I ever do so. To me, where this keyboard excels the most is the price/performance ratio and the form factor. For under a $1000 you get a really good feeling weighted 88 note and great sounding keyboard that weighs 25 pounds and fits sideways in probably all but the tiniest of cars. To me that trumps the minor perceived increase in quality of sounds. If the next one they put out is as much of an improvement as there was between the PX3 (which I almost bought) and this, forget everybody else's products. Btw, these are a steal on auction sites and used if you can find them and if you have the cash, but if not, you can't beat zZound's payment plans. :D                 
I bought this keyboard because of many features! I am just scratching the surface, right now, as to what this keyboard is capable of! I am very happy with my purchase and now am looking for a system to amplify this baby! Using headphones is getting old.                
You know this an awesome keyboard. It does so many things. But there are just too many button pushing so to get things done. There isn't any quick way to get to anything. So if you are going to use this keyboard as a multi sound instrument. You won't be making quick changes of sounds!  The keyboard bed and act are awesome. Definitely a great piano act! Sounds on board are good the pianos are great.                 
I couldn't be more pleased if I tried. This piano is everything as advertised with realistic piano FEEL and SOUND! And excellent MIDI controller for my DAW studio. Thank You Casio and Thank You zZounds!                
The piano(s) sounds great!! Lots of variations and subtle nuances in each voice.
My favorite is the Bright Piano although the default Grand Piano is amazing.
The other sounds are pretty good ranging from orchestral to world instrument sounds and General MIDI.                 
This is a perfect blend of a traditional piano with current technology. In addition to being a great piano it also has the features of an upper end portable keyboard with auto accompaniment, computer integration and more. Read the specs for more details                
Turn it on and it's a piano. Easy. Scroll up or down to get to the different piano sounds.
Select a different bank like Elect Pianos or Strings and scroll though those sounds. Basic stuff like recording is pretty simple. Press record and go. 
It gets a little complex with some of the more in- depth functions that most people might never even touch. Lots of "hold this button while pressing another button" type of thing. It works though otherwise you would have a zillion buttons on the front panel. Owners Manual is actually pretty good.                
Key action and feel is superb! Not cheap and plastic-y but has a classic ivory like texture. On a traditional acoustic piano, the keys in the lower register are heavier and respond differently to the lighter touch for the upper end. This accurately and beautifully recreates those nuances. The instrument is relatively small and compact although not intended  to be a portable keyboard. Very study and they paid attention to the important yet simple things. It has extendable support feet to prevent it from tipping in case the instrument is not against a wall. Also the 3 pedals are reinforced underneath so it is well supported. the music stand is easily removable and allows you to set a laptop in its place.  The sliding key cover is a nice feature usually not found until you get to a much higher price point.
The only thing that would be an improvement aesthetically is to provide a larger modestly panel like they do on the Casio PX-850 which does not have all the additional sounds and features of the PX-780.                
There are other products that have similar features as far as number of sounds and other bells and whistles but you do not get in to this quality with other recognizable brand name manufacturers until a much higher price point.                
I have only had the instrument for a month or two so fortunately there has been need for support yet                
When my daughter's vocal music/piano teacher came to our house, she played this instrument. She loved the sound and feel of the keys and asked where we got and what it costs because she wanted to get one for a small studio space. So WOW from me and my family and WOW from a professional music instructor!                
My wife and I had been kicking around the idea of purchasing an inexpensive used piano for some time. My daughter is very involved in school vocal music and we were looking for something that she could use to practice her scales and exercises and improve her musical abilities. We finally decided on this instrument based on versatility, great reviews and the zZounds Pay-as-you-Play option. This is not a plug for zZounds, just a fact.                
Very nice for the money. Sound quality is excellent. The key action is awesome and so is the simulated ivory. Haven't really explored all features. There is a lot to learn about how to even use them effectively. It would be nice if they had a video tutorial to learn more about all the tones, rhythms, splitting the keyboard, how to use the 16 or 17 track recording unit. There's definitely a whole lot of bang for your buck. The assembly took about 2 hrs. I did it by myself and that included the unpacking and disposal of all the cardboard, styrofoam, plastic and so forth. Just overall impressed with the whole unit. Very happy with my purchase of my Casio Priva PX 780. Would do it again in a second.                
Bought this from zZounds 5 days ago on the "Play As You Pay" plan. It was delivered by FedEx earlier today, in pristine, undamaged condition.
From the fit and finish to the feel of the keyboard and the sound, this is a high end digital piano that is, from my research, one of the best values currently available.
If you're looking to spend about $1k on a digital keyboard with weighted hammer action, then I don't think there's anything better than the PX-780 out there. ( If I thought there was I would have bought it instead of the PX-780. hahahaha)
PROS:
1. Weighted, graded, hammer action that feels like a real acoustic piano.
2. For the default concert grand piano voice (at the default settings) at least, the tonal quality, the dynamic range, timbre nuances, resonance(s), depth, and fullness, especially in the mid-low frequencies, are all of very high acoustic realism and quality.  This is the voice that I will be using most, and I'm very happty with it so far.
3. Dual headphone jacks on the FRONT left of the keyboard.
4. Onboard 16/17-track recorder to develop tunes with.
5. Audio recording of user songs done on the multi-track recorder directly to a USB flash drive device (which connects underneath center -- easy access) in .WAV file format.  (Which can then be transferred to your computer for post production tweaking and subsequent mastering to a CD or DVD, and/or rendering in .MP3 format for uploading to various online music sites, or an .MP3 player or whatever.) 
6. The included 3-pedal system is a really nice feature, and so far mine works flawlessly and with partial pedalling.
7 to whatever.  Stuff that just doesn't come to mind at the moment.  But I think that there's definitely more positive to say about this keyboard than I've said in this 'review'.
I would definitely highly recommend the Casio Privia PX-780 digital piano anybody.  Especially those who want the feel (and sound) of an acoustic piano.  (It feels and sounds more like a grand than an upright.
I've been primarily a Yamaha guy over the years, but I truly think that Casio has hit a home run with this PX-780 Privia.
CONS:
None that I can think of at this time.                
I have been wanting a digital piano for years. I've had my eye on the Casio Privia line ever since it was produced and have always been told it was an amazing piano for an amazing price. Well, right before Christmas, I decided to treat myself to the PX-780. I'd be lying if I didn't confess that the 12 interest-free payments didn't help make that decision for me! Wow, what a great great service zZounds offers in that. PLUS free shipping. I got the piano in less than four days too! 
As far as the sound goes, the PX-780 blew my mind! Casio has taken every opportunity to make the piano sounds on their Privia line the most realistic in the industry as far as I'm concerned. From the realistic feel of the faux ebony and ivory keys, the realistic response, to the fact that you can even hear the dampers on the strings (even just pressing the damper pedal, you can hear the dampers move which shocked me!) 
I'd say the PX-78 has proven to be one of the best digital pianos in the $1,000 or less price range. 
I guess if I had just one tiny thing to say, I'd say I wish there were more room on top for lamps or a music light. That is something I'm working out at the moment. Other than that, I give it a solid 8 out of 10.                
Bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas. It is a good beginner keyboard with some fun features my son enjoys. For the price it offers more than most other small keyboards. I do see him growing out of quickly and needing something more advanced. I don't regret the purchase at all. On a side note I bought a "blemished" version. It looked brand new, the box was a little banged up but for the money saved it was well worth it since the box just went into the trash.                
This is an ideal piano for a preschool aged child. The mini keys are perfect as is the piano size and weight. I also like that it can be battery powered - much safer than using a cord. Also, the child can carry his/her little piano to grandma's, etc. HIghly recommended as a starter keyboard for litle ones.                 
I wanted a keyboard that was easily portable with more than two octaves but less than 61-keys.  I needed sounds that were pitched an octave higher and lower to get the range I sometimes needed.  I needed it to be in concert pitch.  This was the only current model I could find like that. zZounds delivered it to me, several states away, in less than 24 hours.                
For it's price range it's a great little instrument.                 
There are no accessories - which is why I gave this a 8. Had the keyboard come with a power source I would have rated it a 10 as the features are wonderful for such a small keyboard. It has a great variation of sounds and even has little drum sound pads on it.                
Very easy to use and carry.                
Rated this in the middle as I never had to call the company.                
Sex appeal??? It's a keyboard - and yes, it looks nice. But "sex appeal"?????                
Cute keyboard! My 2 year old feels like a rock star! The only minus is no power cord included, when there is an opening for it?! Weird.                
My 7 yr son wanted an electric Keyboard, Not sure how this fad of his will pan out and I didn't want a big abandoned piano take up space. I got him this one which can be tucked away in a closet when not used.If he will get serious with playing the piano I will buy him a more sophisticated oneSounds, construction is great                
Great little keyboard for my beginner piano player                
Good, but not great because of the smaller width keys. You can practice on it, but then have to re-program your finger's muscle memory to full width keys. For the price, met our needs, but if I had to buy one again, I'd look for one with full width keys, even if it was longer. Didn't need all the electronic "features".                
The reason I'm bothering to comment about its features is because, when plugged into a MIDI controller, it works as another MIDI signal trigger just like a key, fader, knob, etc, would. I use this to trigger the main function button of Ableton Live's "Looper" device, which allows me to start recording my microphone's signal without having to touch the computer. Really handy when I want to get something down quickly and accurately but don't want to take my attention away from the instrument. Look at this Sustain Footpedal as another MIDI controller of its own!                
I got one of these with the Casio Privia PX100 years ago. I've never had any problems with it. It just works. Doesn't fall apart.                
It's totally worth the $19. I'm selling my PX100, and the smaller MIDI controller I'm buying doesn't come with one of these, so I'm buying one from zZounds now.                
First let me preface this by saying that I am a professional musician with over 40 years of performing and production experience and have been playing piano and keyboards for over 50 years. Piano was my first instrument, but I am a drummer/percussionist for the most part. I have a very elaborate keyboard rig that I use mostly for production and in the studio.
Recently I was hired by an established band as their percussionist but when they found out I play keyboards as well, they wanted me add a keyboard to my rig and play that on some of the songs. Unfortunatly taking one of the instruments I already owned would create a big hassle to pull out of the studio rig and reprogram it for every gig.
So, I was looking for a new, light weight keyboard with good and practical sounds that would be easy to transport and had everything I needed in one instrument. I didn't want to spend a fortune on it as I already have enough invested in equipment. So, after researching pretty much everything on the market for a month I decided on the Casio WK-6600.
I picked this one because it has a lot of great sounds on it that are going to be usable in a professional working band. Things you are going to use like accoustic pianos that sound real, electric pianos that give you almost every option of sounds from classic models like a Fender Rhodes and many others as well as over 50 excellent organ sounds. The strings sound terrific and there are a lot of recognizable brass and lead synth tones as well. All sounds are customaizable and you can add a boat load of digital effects so you can get a lot out of this instrument. 
That being said, you can also pretty much take it out of the box and give the instruction manual a five minute glance to see how to select the sounds and take it to a gig. The on-board sounds are terrific and for this price, they will blow you away.
The WK-7600 has actual drawbars so if you are big into the organ thing, you will love those, but for my needs they were a little overkill, but I did need a pitch bend wheel so I opted for the WK-6600 over the WK-245.
The on board speakers sound pretty good and for practicing and working on arrangements will be all you need.  No, they aren't going to blow the guitar player out of the room, but run this through a good keyboard amp and you can hold your own in any playing environment.
The workstation part of the deal was an added bonus for me and works like most top end workstations so it will serve me well as an option for doing work at home or in a different studio than the one I work at.
Now, it's important to note that this is not built like a tank, but neither is a violin or accoustic guitar. You need to take care of it and carry it in a case. It has a plastic chassis so dropping it off the end of the stage isn't going to end well. On the flip side it's also about half the weight of most of my other keyboards which is what I was looking for. It makes it super easy to transport.
The keyboard action falls somewhere in between a typical organ/synth style and a fully weighted piano style action. It's velocity sensitive, so you get dynamics, but not as heavy an action as a piano. It's actually kind of a nice blend.
No, it's not a $5000 instrument, but it functions very well in a pro environment so if you are on a budget and need something that's going to cut it on a real world gig, check this one out. As a writing and arrangers tool, you will be very happy using this as well.
I would highly recomend this to anyone looking to get a lot of bang for their buck.
Good quality sounds ! Rebuilding my studio on a tight budget ! It works just fine ! Love the easy recording set up ! You can make beats right out the box ! You will have to tweek your sounds to get them the way you want them to sound but for the most part these sounds are some of the sounds in the big name keyboards! I have owned several big names and this cheap baby can hang with them ! For this price point you can't beat it with a stick ! If you need MIDI keys for your DAW This baby can handle that ! needed more keys every thing has only 61 keys or less. The keys feel good and it is easy to use !                
I could not be happier with the Casio WK 6600!!!  The sound is fantastic and it is easy to navigate...I am just diving in to all it can do but WOW what a great buy for a bargain!!!!!                 
Love it. Sit it on my desk and everytime a tune comes in my head, walk over to it and sound it out. All I need to do is press the on button and play the piano which is the default. Get finished with the keyboard and transfer my notes to my guitar which is my main instrument. Simple, direct, fun. No more trying to work a tune out on my fretboard. Bought it used and blemished but I cant find a flaw. I am new to keyboards so don't expect a comparison-to-other-keyboards type review.. This $220 deal has changed the way I sound out music forever. I simply give it a 5 star because it totally fit my needs. Your needs might be different.                
If your looking for a Korg, this isn't it, but it sounds good for the money.                
After having used a Casio WK-3700 (silver one) for many years as a live workstation, I went ahead and bought this which was supposed to be the new model with 76 keys. Well, this one felt like a toy, the volume knob is about to break, it feel tough to move, crappy speakers, the previous silver model had great full sounding speakers, but the biggest reason I can't even use this is, it has NO KEYPAD to quickly select your patch, so you have to use a bank button, THEN a rotary knob to get to patches. The older model had a keypad which meant I could quickly dial in a patch live. I am considering swapping this one with my old one.                
My review will be short to due my limited time with the WK-7600 and my lack of playing skills.  I'd say that an arranger type keyboard like this would be a bit much for a beginner or novice as it has an amazing set of features, knobs and sliders. For a pro, it might be a bit underwhelming. For the budding artist or someone on a budget, it's a steal.                
I received my item in a timely manner and is enjoying the my keyboard.                
Ok, let's start by telling my story on how I ended up buying this beauty. I had a Yamaha MX 61 which I played every day until some crooked hominids broke in my house and took it with the rest of my musical toys (acoustic and electric guitars, Tascam recorder, etc.....)Anyways.....I used to buy my "toys" at another virtual store until I found this musicians oasis on the net, zZounds!!!!Thanks to the easy payments programs with no interest at all, I was able to get my life (yes, music IS my life!!) Back!!!!That being said, I got the Casio XW-P1 a few days ago and I am amaze with all the features like the Hex layer mode and the performance mod, were you can modify your tone and rhythms on the fly is amazing.The sounds are satisfying for my needs and likeness. I do not play in any band or jam with friends anymore but with this, I can do all of that and more.I am still learning and I know will take me a while until I discover the full potential of this synthesizer. My only critic is that the manual IS NOT USER FRIENDLY. But, you can find plenty of tutorials videos all over the net. Very helpful indeed!Price wise, you just cannot beat this one, especially if you buy it here at zZounds.The hardware is not design to take the "every night at the bar gig" beating, but if you take the necessary care with it, I am sure it will last for a very long time ( I still have my Casio HT-700 since 1988) Came with the power cord, instructions (not very clear though)All in all, I do recommend this board, and especially if you buy it here at zZounds.                
You simply can't review this keyboard fairly without consideration of its low price. It is NOT a first-tier, pro-quality keyboard. Most of the presets are cheesy, the color scheme is questionable, and unless you put the D batteries in (!!!) it's light as a feather. But let's look at what you get for the money. First of all the MIDI implementation is spot on, which is more than you could say for the CZ line of yore. (My CZ5000 didn't even have a Local MIDI Off!!!) The Hammond emulation with the mini-drawbars is pretty damn good, even if the Leslie simulation is less than. The sequencer/arpeggiator is surprisingly good, making it a very useful musical sketchpad, as well as a performance feature. The PCM tones are nice if not superlative, the Hex Layer implementation is very flexible and great for people who want to mix tones rather than get into deep synth editing, the DSP is more than serviceable for live performance--basically it's all done well, with no major lapses in function. Consider for a moment why I bought this keyboard. I used to play keys back in the day, and have some rudimentary skills in performance and synth editing. Bass is now my main ax, and I'm putting together a band to play upbeat oldies, and was looking for the cheapest instrument I could get to do decent vintage sounds--Vox , Farfisa, and Hammond organs, Wurlitzer electric piano, clavinet, and acoustic piano variants--to be used in a live context with a loud, rocking band. (Not your most critical situation.) I figured I could work on the sounds while I was looking for someone that could play the instrument. I found out online that someone had already developed a set of patches to do the Farfisa and Vox sounds using the Hex Layer configuration, so I bought it. Now that I've started to play with the thing, I've discovered that the vintage sounds are all good enough for rock'n'roll--but that layering the sound with some of those cheesy synth presets makes them rock even more! The charm of Vox and Farfisa organs, for example, is the limitations. They weren't rich instruments, they were transistor-driven kazoos compared to synths from the Eighties on--but they rocked, damn it. You could use this Casio as a poor man's Clavinova if you want, but that's not what it does best. What it does best is make Noises That Rock--and if you have any punk sense of adventure in you, you're likely to love this nearly as much as that vintage ARP Odyssey you can't afford.                
Played a wedding with the xw-p1 this past Saturday in a five piece band. After having several practices with it and getting my settings configured, I had everything set and ready for the show and it went very smooth. Switching settings was fast and easy, and learning the controls took very little time after reviewing the manual.
I think one good feature to add would be a user bank of mixed sound presets from different categories. (Each user bank can only be in that specific category, like all organs are in the organ presets).
Otherwise, the build quality is nice, the ability to run on batteries is fantastic, and the look of the unit is great.
Love it!                
I went into the local music store with buying the Roland Juno in mind. When I tried these 2 out side by side, the Casio won hands down. The first thing I noticed was that the Juno has smaller keys than the Casio. The XW-P1 just feels better to play than the Juno, and I am a big Roland fan, owning several of their keyboards. Now if the Casio will only last as long as the Rolands, I'll be hooked for life!                
After watching all the videos from NAMM, I pulled the trigger and I just received a XW-P1 a few days ago. I admit that at first I wasn't so sure about it, but things thing has blown me away. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun with a synth. The lead sounds are wicked and it is easy to edit and make your own. The Hex Layers are really cool too. The drawbar organs seem cool but that's not really my thing. The Step Sequencer was a little confusing at first but now I'm using it to control some of my other synths over MIDI. For EDM this sequencer is amazing.I wish it had aftertouch but overall the XW-P1 is one of the best hardware purchases I've made in a while.                
This is an excellent entry-level keyboard.  It has a good collection of voices and features such as the sequencer and arpeggiator. The drawbar organ emulator is worth the price of the keyboard.  The piano voices are a little weak.  If you already have a pro-quality keyboard, this won't add much.  But if this is your first  'board, it's an excellent value.                
This is by far superior to any korg , roland or yamaha in the same price range. All the features are excellent. I use the organ with the VENT and the sound is marvelous, inspiring and heavenly. I do declare that it is high time we stopped believing in brand names and face the facts. This CASIO xwp1 is the way to go . I cannot understand why korg, roland or yamaha do not want to make a $500 keyboard with these sounds and features. They would be selling them by the thousands. Well, I understand companies want to make millions, but Casio is the only one who is giving top quality for 500 bucks. INCREDIBLE, UNBELIEVABLE. Go for it CASIO, I want to buy your next synth with 120 polyphony and over 1000 sounds. Please do not dis this machine because it is not fair. This one has very powerful sounds and I am more than pleased.                
Wasn't too thrilled with this one. Sold it after a week and got the Korg Microstation instead. MUCH better keyboard!                
This review is simple and to the point.
This pedal is a great foundation pedal for your effects chain.  If you play the blues or classic rock and you want that 1959 Fender Bassman holy grail tone then this is it.
I know because years ago I owned an original 59 Bassman. I never thought a pedal could come close to that amazing tone but this comes so close it's hard to tell the difference. Dial it in correctly and Bam there you go.
It's made like a tank and the controls are very effective.
Get a 18 Volt DC power supply for it and you get even more headroom and a clearer tone that way.
zZounds as always is the best to deal with, period.
that should have been 5 stars for sound, I miss hit the star.                
I had been looking for an Overdrive that was not a typical Boss or OCD. I started watching Youtube Videos and found this pedal there. SO many reviews. I asked my buddy about it and he says he has on at home and at his recording studio also. HE says it it unreal with its Bass tone as well as treble and mids. He then says it adjusts just like a Marshall Amp so I ask, but, you already have a Marshall? HE says he doesn't have to run his Marshall at deafening tones to get the break up that this one provides and that I should quit bugging him and just get it and thank him later. I thanked him later. I have to use three different pedals stacked to get the tone of this thing. It hardly uses any power so I can run it for a very long time on a Battery if I wish. IT is my favorite pedal on my whole board                
This review is for Super Lead mode only as I have not tried the Super Bass mode. In Super Lead, this really does give you access to a range of Marshall amp tones. My target is something from Plexi to JCM800 depending on my needs and this pedal delivers. What you must keep in mind however is that the pedal reacts VERY differently based on input voltage. I honestly was not loving the pedal on 9 volts. It is billed as variac-like, and there may be some truth to that, but for my liking the tone was just way too loose and soupy and not to my ears what I like about the Marshall amps listed above. I decided to try 18 volts and whoa, that was the ticket. Much tighter, more "precise" but still has that tube amp feel. Very reactive with the guitar volume and picking dynamics.I should also mention that this pedal reacts very well with other pedals in front of it. A good screamer variant (I have the Cusack) gives you a fantastic gain boost for super sustaining solos or other work requiring extreme amounts of gain. A clean boost also works well, like the Xotic EP and I particularly love the DLS paired with my Xotic SP Compressor. It is this combination of the DLS and the SP that give me such an outstanding Marshall tone. Balanced, just enough gain, great sustain. Very inspiring and just makes me want to keep playing. Now I have access to all kinds of classic Marshall tones from 70s classic rock to 80s hair metal and everything in between. Works well with all my guitars from Duncan JB and 59 to Gibson 57 Classics to Barden Tele to EMG DG20 set.                
I tested every OD pedal in my guitar shop and it was clear that the DLS was the winner. While other OD pedals sounded a little tinny or thin, the DLS sound incredibly thick and saturated.  Goes great with Gibson SG in Super Lead mode. Super Bass mode sounds great with a Tele. This pedal will make any amp sound like a Marshall                
Hey all garbage pale kids out there in Tupac land. This is the Epoch Delay. The effect pedal that’s going to do great things when it grows up and maybe even save a company from the depths of hell. It will assist you on your sonic journey and might even help you find Animal Chin. Lay down all you’re other delay devices and worship the one true Slapback god. Worship no false idols before it.....The Epoch Deluxe Delay will save your wretched soul, soul, soul!                
Apart from various "demos" on this pedal many already using an LP. It does not reinvent the Page tone but it is a nice foundation stacking OD which I find adds warmth and more amp like tone to an already good tone. My best Pagey tones are using a Pinnacle on vintage around mid on the tones the RAH in front and often a clean boost or another drive in front of the RAH. Killer Pagey stack ranging from cleaner blues to Physical Graffiti tones. Do not presume this pedal alone will give you instant Pagey, it will help but it is a foundation stacking pedal more than a stand alone.                 
This pedal has awesome functionality and awesome sound. Smooth plate reverb will improve the sound quality of any rig! I had to contact customer service because I broke one of the knobs, and they sent one right out the same day! Awesome!                 
I listened to many tremolo pedals before I got this one. It’s simple, well-built, and you’ll swear you’re listening to a vintage tweed amp. This one’s a keeper.                
Great, Awesome sound. Finally a Flange that's just not a preset sweep. Really organic. You can control the amount of sweep by holding the button down and depending on the pressing and releasing, you can start the sweep before the end of the last and really have something more like studio controlled analog flanging. A must have. I can't imagine not having it in my chain.                
Being able to manually trigger the start of the sweep is the feature I have being looking for. Build quality is good and the sound is real good. I might wish for a feedback control to intensify the effect if they come out with a version two. But overall very happy. It does what it's supposed to.Haven't needed factory support so can't really rate it.                
I just receeived this adapter. There is a loss in the signal, in terms of both tone and volume.  The resulting sound is very dull, compared with the one what you would get without this adapter.                
It is a simple female-to-female adapter.                
Easy to use.                
This is not something I had expected.                
Don't know yet.                
I will not use it.  I am searching for a better adapter with little or no signal loss.  If you are serious about tone, don't get this one.                
these would be great if every pedal had the inputs/outputs at the same height.  since all pedals are different these may not work well for you with out putting your pedals at a weird angle and in a bind.                  
Work as advertised.    Ignore the effects comments by the poster trying to connect a pedal -- OF COURSE IT DOES NOT WORK.   It's for rack gear (Balanced connection!)     Clearly the person trying to connect it to a pedal has no idea what they are doing.                
No features to speak of.  It's an adapter.                
Plug it in.  It works.                
Excellent physical build.                
A bit on the pricey side especially when you compare it some of the Neutrik and Switchcraft options.                
Comes apart and doesn't have a notch to hold it in very well with screw.  The fact that you can take it apart can be a great thing for some people so these are very subjected.                
Great ends, quality Beldon Cable, good workmanship and made in the USA.                
I purchased this cable NEW from zZounds and it lasted one show!  I used it for one gig, then during rehearsal a couple of days later it starting cutting out.  Geezzz - truly you get what you pay for.  I will return back to my Monster cable.                 
used these cables before their great but dog hair sticks to them.only draw back! ha ha                
I purchased 3 of these at a great price to use at one of the churches I play at, since the 6 input mixer couldn't handle all of the microphone pairs I wanted to use.  I have freed up 3 channels and am ready to expand my setup there.  I am ordering 6 more to use at the other 2 churches in my parish!                
with out question the very best cable on the market.  As a DJ/Karaoke pro I have to nothing but the best, so that my customers can enjoy the very best other wise I go out of business.  If you wanna play you gotta PAY.
Your Customers will never forget a good experiance                
N/A                
You can get them in any length I got 1 foot since I use it for my drum module and my hi hat isnt far from it and I dont want a 3 foot cable on the floor. The one foot is perfect might purchase a 6 foot one for my Bass                
Easy Install                
Built Sturdy                
Best Bang For Your Buck                
N/A Probably Wont Have To Either                
The metal around the inputs makes it sexy lol                
Gets the job done and wont disappoint                
Well as sound isn't "really" effected by cables which are better then cheap...ill just say 10                
Its a cable and at that it does well.  I found it not to twist THAT easily, which is nice.                
I find it to be made well and its back by a 10year warrenty.  Also its made in the US                
for $14 for a 25 foot is great especially at this quality.                
I haven't delt with or needed to, but as i said it has a 10 year warrenty.                
Its practical but i guess cables can have sex appeal? Its simple and gets the job done.                
Well i hope i dont have to use the 10 year warrenty but its nice to know its there so i plan to use this cable for a while and actually own 2 (one as a backup)                
Nothing special, just a good price                
First off, its a cable and it does what its supposed to, connect my guitar to my amplifier. Now if your an audiophile and absolutely want the best tone, there are better options such as mogami or monster cable, etc. However given the price to performance ratio, you cant get any better than these cables. I use several of these to connect guitar, amp, and pedalboard together and I notice no loss in tone compared to more expensive cables (I have some mogami cables as well and did a comparison). I'm not saying that there isn't a difference between these cables top of the line ones, I'm just saying i couldn't tell a difference.                
Its a cable, self explanitory                
Pretty easy to plug it in                
The soldering is top notch and it is heat shrinked for extra reinforcement. I would expect these cables to last a while                
Like I said before, for the price you can't get any better performance than these cables                
Haven't dealt with the company                
For this price?
Can't be beat. Sound is true enough when tested against my other cables, like Monster cables. Can't tell a bit of difference.                
Like the right angle / straight sides for hooking up to my effects and loop.                
Its a cable                
I give it an 8. Could it be a little beter made? Sure, but you'd have to pay more. This is a bargain!!                
Can't beat this price                
n/a                
just a practical addition to my setup.                
I am satisified for now, but always have backup cables, just in case. Only time will tell if this was a real bargain.                
Tried out the Gold Rush 10' on usual equipment and was a little shocked at the wide range of clear tones. Did have a Hosa, Fender and Monster cable before this. Very happy with the results. The cable is a true beauty, thin and stiff. The gold appears and disappears depending on the angle. Once again, I could not be more happy than with this CBI.                
It gives your tone the fullness that most cables kill.  It has a vary full tone.                  
Its a cable how can it have more features?                
The cable does not get kinks or knots.                
Best you can buy.  It is so reliable.                
If you want tone, buy this.                
CBI is a great company.                
It is cool looking.                
Totally great.  Good full tone and road tough.                
Good, very full tone                
NEVER gets knotted up or anything!                
I don't gig regularly but it seems like it would most definately hold up on the road                
I like the gold inputs and the black cable with specs of "gold" in it                
I love it. Would replace if stolen or something of that nature                
Bang on. Ad was accurate. Product was as good or better than expected. All circuits tested perfectly. Build quality, labeling, stress wrap is excellent.                
Would it be possible to design an easy-to-use wrap and carry system.  Might detract from the cost of this system which I was VERY pleased with.  I just realize, now that it's in use, that carring 100' of cable with the box on one end and the connectors on the other end puts the system at some risk.                
Our grougp just put together a system with JBL bottoms and Yamaha tops. Yamaha 20 channel board---2500 Crown Amp for bottoms and 1500 Crown for the tops--Using an SHS 2500 amp for Monitors--DBX Crossover, DBX EQ for main and DBX for Mont. other effexts in the rack as well....Snake 100 ft and easy hook as expected---Rock the hell out at a gig Oct. 29th---excellent samll clug hook up                
all                
#1                
great construction                
yes                
had no need to                
great                
yes                
This, by far, has to be the worst cable I've ever owned. It is a light gauge cable and the connectors are poorly made. It failed *just outside* the 30 day warranty period. It did come with my mic package (mic, stand, cable), so it was practically for free, which is why I'm not too upset. However, I would have gladly paid more initially for a better quality cable to be included.
Even though I have not used this cable in performance, I can definitely say it is not road worthy. I've had cables that had really harsh treatment on the road and outlasted this one by years.                 
I could have pursued this as it was still covered under manufacturers warranty, but decided it wasn't worth it. David @ Zzsounds was helpful and offered me a discount on a different cable.  My only disappointment was that I feel a 60 day warranty would be much more useful (which is why I shaved a point off).                
Used them last night, sound was fine.                
Mic cables, what can you say?                
N/A                
Hey, they are economy cables. They do not appear sturdy enough for heavy-duty use. I used them for my drum mics, which have a fairly low amount of tension.                
low price - quality proportionate                
N/A                
N/A                
I am overall satisfied with the product.                
The sound is very good.                 
This is a cable, dosent have any features                
Plug and play!!!!!                
Do it. It's a pretty good cable for this price. If it cost $30, i'd still buy it.                
I have not needed any support, yet.                
I've had it for about 3 month and they held up. My sister can through one day and accidentally tripped on the cord and pull it really far (like about 30 feet!!) and it still works good                
I bought 6 less than 6 months ago and have systematically thrown them all away.  Nothing like your karaoke singer's mics cutting out mid song.                
Wire is flimsy weak junk. Plugs don't work in new jacks like the good one's are Switchcraft or Speakon. Don't Waste your time with these. Most times won't even plug in and make connection                
If it don't plug in and make connection, then obviously this is useless. Wasted time and money.                
CRAP.                
A HUGE NO!!!   The money you spend for product and shipping, and return shipping, You could have bought 3 good ones.                
Why bother their stuff just don't work with pro gear.                
Don't work, DON'T WANT IT !                
Trashed them first day. Not worth sending back. No one should not be allowed to sell this crap.                
Extremely poor quality. Two of three cables failed in less than 7 months. The wire is flimsy and solder connections are VERY poor. I finally trashed them all.                
Every time our church needs new cables, I buy these. Years ago, we used to buy the bargain "3 pack" of another brand for $15. They don't last. Spend a few extra dollars on these, and you wont be sorry. I'm not sure why, but about 3 years ago (and earlier) these cables came with a "Lifetime Warranty", but on our most recent purchase, it says that they come with a "10 Year Warranty". Regardless, we have never (as of yet) had to have one of these cables replaced. If we get 10 years of use out of these cables, I probably wouldn't even bother with making a warranty claim. Now, they don't get used, or get abused, like a working band would use them, but for our purposes, they work great.                
I am very happy with this cable. It performs very well, and appears to by quite rugged. I use the cable between my mixer board and a powered speaker. ZZounds was good to deal with and delivery was prompt.                
This is great. The Neutrik Connectors snap right in and made of metal. I'm confident they will last a lifetime.                
Good quality, low noise.                
I guess it has good features, the neutrik connectors are good.                
Good quality with belden cable and neutrik connectors, low noise.                
Good price for the quality                
Good warranty.                
it looks pretty good, discreet black connectors                
Good quality overall.                
I recently switched over from passive to active speaker set up for our band's PA.  Had to change out all the Neutrik cables for XLR.  Running EV ZXa1 subs with JBL EON 610 mains, and bought these cables to connect to the mixing board.  So far so good.  Can't comment on durability since I've only used them twice, but they seem like good cables.                
I usually just use Live Wire or Monster because of the lifetime warranty.  We gig full time in a cover band and play the usual bar and grill, island resort, and occasional casino gig, so the CBI's do plenty enough of a good job for me.  However, on the fly, I prefer to buy Live Wire because you only have to buy it once replace it for free if it goes bad.  And the clips on the Neutrik female ends of my CBI cable keep getting stuck and I have to pry them out with my fingernails.  Other than that, I'm happy.  You can't beat getting two 30' mic cords for $45!                
Very good mid-priced cable, not noisy                
Good connectors, heavy cable                
works as it should                
not really appealing, just a mic cable                
seems durable and quiet, thats really all I need                
Ordered a pair of 50 ft. CBI microphone cables and had them at my door the next day!                
These are some of the best budget cables or the price I have ever own.                
I was amazed at how quick the items I purchased arrived. The microphone cables worked just fine. I have another project at church and will order more cables for our fellowship hall. Very Pleased!                
Quality cables good value.                
This is a pretty decent sounding cable. I don't know if it compares to handmade, or Mogami studio cables, but nice nonetheless.                
It has everything a cable should.                
It works like a cable.                
Well, the Belden cable and Neutrik connectors should speak for themselves. Time will tell.                
Eh, a dollar a foot for a good quality cable doesn't seem outlandish to me.                
Didn't talk to anyone.                
The Neutrik connectors look nicer than cheap ones...                
I would think it's a solid purchase for anyone looking for, well, a cable. Take a step up and have some made if these don't cut it for you.                
Very Good to excellent

I purchased these cables for use in our church. They get a lot of use because they are connected and disconnected at least twice a week, for band practice and Sunday service, plus whatever other programs that go on during the week. You pretty much get what you pay for when it comes to cables, and so far, even though these are not high end cables, seem well worth the price paid. I would suggest that whatever cable you get, make sure it has the Neutrik connectors. You won't be sorry.                
I bought several of these cables with the highly touted Neutrick connectors. After only a few months several of these connectors screw on back covers split for no apparent reason. Some were in fixed rack equipment with no movement or any other physical abuse. Although the wire quality and assembly seems good I won't be buying any more. Other brands of similiar age have shown no problems.                  
I tried to find the back covers to replace the split ones and no luck. I finally replaced the connectors with some quality shell and insert types.                 
The 2 out of 8 that I ordered that work sound good.  2 DOA 4 failed within a few months while 30 other brand cables that I use work fine under under same non-abusive use.                
It's a cable.                
Easy to troubleshoot when no signal.                
New cables DOA or going bad in a short period of time by no fault of the consumer have a negative value.  I would have paid for the knowledge not to buy CBI.                
Sent letter to VP of company.  No reply.                
Absolute junk!                
CBI has all the best cables. They never short out or anything.                
No comment, it is a cable.                
Best cables you can buy.                
See above.                
They have lifetime guarantees. This makes this cable really shine.                
Awesome cable.                
Best cable company there is.                
your speaker cable are far superios to any i have owned.  the sound and quality of construction are great.                
i love the plated ends.  plus they roll up easy and can take a beating.                
the guitar sound was superior to the cables i got with the peavey speaker system.  i threw out the cables that i had because they constantly lost connection.  your solder joints at the cable ends are great and heavy duty.                
it will last forever                
i purchased 2 speaker wires from radio shack.  radio shack was almost twice the price and was 5 foot shorter then yours.                
the company was helpful and informative                
i would not buy any other manufacturers speaker cable or microphone cable.  your product is superior                
These are thick, well made speaker cables suitable for connecting mains or monitors to your amplifier.  The 1/4" plugs are well made and the cable itself is very thick compared to the original cables that came with our system.  I have used them only twice but we observed no buzz or distortion through our system.  My only complaint is that I wish they were ten feet longer.  The next size up was much too big.                
  I really like these cables. They feel good and heavy and I'm sure they will carry the signal with out any loss of strength.                
These cables are worthy! Needed some longer cables for bigger spread on our speakers. These are better quality than I was expecting. I'm pleased!                
The cables are nice and thick and feet quality, but ends have metal shells and are twice as thick as what the picture shows. These cables cannot be plugged into my audio interface, both at the same time, which is not right. The whole reason why I got them is due to seeing CBI cables in the recommended section                
These 14-gauge cables deliver good sound even at lengths of 175 feet from amp to speaker.                
The PVC jacket is rugged but stiffer than rubber, but seems to endure better regarding sharp surfaces cutting or nicking the surface.                
It winds well enough --but the stiffness, especially when new, can be hard to overcome, so it is important to always wind it correctly.                
After three years the connectors are finally failing. The 1/4" sleeve portion of the plug comes loose where it is riveted onto the fiber disc. It can't be fixed, so the connectors must be replaced. When they get loose, there is the danger of a short happening, or just an outright lack of a connection, which could damage the amp. I got a terrible high end hiss one time because of the looseness--not sure if it was amp related or a bad connection into the speaker. The outer cover had an oversized opening for a larger cable, and the play it allowed from the extra space may be contributing to the early loosening. In the picture of the connector, it does not appear to be the oversized-opening type. Maybe it was a quick exchange during manufacturing due to a lack of a smaller-opening outer cover being available. The opening should be as small as possible for the cable jacket to fit in. My cables are not subjected to excessive abuse or use, and I am always very gentle with them despite this eventual and increasingly evident problem.                
Despite the connector issue, I would still prefer them for the value.                
Not attempted.                
It's just a cable with connectors on it...for sex appeal, a cable can be considered phallic in nature, especially with oversized connectors.                
It does the trick for now.                
Not much to say but it connects my amp to my speakers, much nicer then the overpriced other cable I'd been using.                
The CBI cord may not be as good a quality cord as say a monster cord, but it seems to be able to stand up to the abuse that I put them through. I,m a DJ and work about 2 weekends a month. My prier experience with CBI speaker cords and as a Bass player in an active band and used the CBI instrument cords believe that they are great product.                
One of the CBI's was defective and was quickly replaced. Had a 10' & 6'. It had an old style package. The new one is flawless. The soldering is okay, definitely done by hand. These are about 1/2 of the weight of Monster, but I switched to avoid Jac damage. The package says there's a 10 year guarantee.                
We purchased two 25' and one 50' CBI 14 Gauge Speaker Cables. Good, solid cables at a reasonable price.  We will be purchasing more in the naer future as we replace older cables.                
Sounds great, looks great. Very satisfied.                 
Perfect- No issues with sound quality.                
I did not know I would need to open up the cable and 'redo' some connections to use the cable in a "bridged-mono" application. Even though some work was needed to be done to it so it would fit my application, there were no issues and I was up and running in minutes.                
Plug it in! If you need to change some polarities on the connectors it's no big deal. Very simple product.                
Very high quality. Upon opening up the connectors, I saw that the connections were very solid and any soldering points or points of contact were manufactured very well.                
Value is great. This cable will last an incredibly long time as long as you don't do anything stupid with it. I honestly think you could use this cable as a tow line for moving a broken down car. This thing is rugged...                
N/A                
Roger Ebert gives it "Two Thumbs Up"                
Purchased this cable for connection between a power amp and subwoofer. Cable is very heavy and definitely 'road-worthy'.                
High quality cable, high quality connectors. Can't go wrong.                
Have use the CBI cables for about 20 years and have never had a one fail me.  A great product for the price.                
Great cables.  More boom in the subs.. cables do matter                
behringer  EP1500 amp  yamaha  A500  speakers  use to use cheap gemsound cables upgraded to cbi amp doesnt run as hot tighter low end                
simple plugand play                
very solid previous cables i used speakon connector came loose                
oh yeah                
havent had to contact them no problems                
great                
dont have to look im satisied                
It worked fine for 2 months then it quit working completely. Took the ends apart and the wires are connected solidly but it does not work at all. Replaced it with a monster speakon cable. Hopefully it will last longer?                
Im going to send them an email through their website and see if they will replace it?                
IT IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED.MYSETUP IS MUCH QUICKER AND I DONT WORRY ABOUT PROBLEMS DURING A SHOW.                
WORTH THE $$$$$$ PAID!!!                
DID NOT NEED SUPPORT YET..THEY WORK FINE                
OWN IT                
SHOULD LAST FEW YEARS OF USE.                
Definitely worth's it's money, very well made                 
Don't mess w/ 16 guage - these are the cables you need.  Tough duty rubber covering stands up to hard use, connections to plugs are solid, 1/4" and Speakon plug ends are heavy duty and make tight connections and 14  guage wire gives less signal loss.  You can spend more but you can't get more for your buck.                
better quality cable                
u can conect a jack input speaker from a speakon                
great cheap cables very good plugs 1/4 and the speakon as well..                 
Only worked for 3 months, guess I should have paid more for a better cable.                
Sound is not really the issue here, it is ease of play, which improves your music, but it does not actually change tone or pitch.                
It helps with the clammy or sticky feel a guitar can sometimes have, based on humidity, temp, your hand's chemestry, cleanliness, etc.  I have used this product for 20 years.  A can lasts for years.  I hold it in my right hand, and spray it to hit my fretboard, left hand and back of the guitar neck in one brief spray.  It is usually good for a full set of playing(45 min to an hour).                
every can consistently good, lasts a long time.                
Never had to deal with them.                
I always have this product sitting on top of my amp, in quick reach for all practice sessions, and gigs.                
All good, no negative comments                
This stuff rocks. And it lasts forever. I bought one can 10 years ago, and I just now ran out. I figure if I buy 4 cans of the stuff, I'll be good until I'm ready to start collecting social security. Typically, I use lemon oil on my rosewood fretboards, but only after I've cleaned them very well with rubbing alcohol. However, I love the look and feel of a high gloss finish on maple. Problem is you can get tacky/sticky issues. That's what I use this stuff for. I use finger ease on the back of my guitar necks, and it plays and feels wonderful. Try it, you'll like it.                
Does what it's supposed to do. And only a dab is needed. I spray a very small section of the back of my neck with the stuff, and then take a clean cloth and rub it up and down the guitar neck.                 
Couldn't get much easier.                
It's good quality stuff. I've never had any issues with it discoloring my finish or anything like that.                
I used a similar product before that came in a tube. I don't remember what it was called, but finger ease is a better product in my own estimation.                 
Never needed support.                
are spray cans sexy?                
It's good stuff.                
Cuts down on string noise                
I paid seven bucks at a guitar store.  Not worth that much!                
good product to cut string noise and makes it easier on callouses.  If you get it on your pick fingers, its almost impossible to keep hold of the pick.                
Been around and using it since the mid or so '70s. Clean, effective, no harm to strings, neck or fretboard. just cover your frets. Afterward after wipe down, spray some on a clean white cotton sock and finish the strings all the way down in the pickup area. Great stuff. Makes for easy smooth playing and keeps strings clean. Excellent on back of neck. Allow to dry for a couple of minutes or so and then wipe down.                
Overall this kit sounds very nice for the money. The stock heads are okay, but not great. I will be replacing them with some nice coated heads in the near future. That being said, I did some recording with them today and was impressed. The drums were tuned pretty tight from the factory but we're easily tuned to my liking. The kick drum is like a Canon, very punchy. I was probably most surprised by the snare drum. I didn't have high expectations but was pleasantly surprised by just how good it sounds.                
The biggest selling points for me on this kit were the Virgin bass drum, and short tom depths. The stand mounted vs kick mounted toms were a must have for me. The kick drum legs have two positions. Open and closed. It is a simple and sturdy set up, and it's nice to not have to mess with setting them evenly. The hardware pack was an added bonus, but I would have gladly paid less for just the Shell pack, and got different hardware.                
It took me about 2.5 hours to set up from unboxing to playing. A beginner might find some of the set up a bit challenging, but if you know drums you shouldn't have much of an issue. The memory clamps take some time to dial in, but once they are you won't have to do it again. The mating function really helps to speed up set up time in a fast paced gig situation. The lugs on the drums must be aligned just right in order to get the screws to thread. It came with some grease for the kick drum lugs but was still quite difficult. Thankfully the kick is the only drum that requires this assembly, until you want to change heads.                
The drums themselves are well made. The bearing edges are very precise, and the wrap finish is nice. I did have some difficulty getting some of the screws to thread, but eventually worked it out. The hardware pack is pretty cheap. The rivets in the stands don't seem like they will hold up to constant set up an tear down. The cymbal stands have some play in the legs which is bothersome. The kick pedal is not awesome. The beater is cheap and will need replacing if you intend to use the pedal. The chain linkage seems light and cheesy compared to other entry level gear. Same for the hit hat stand, although the hihat does have good action. The tom mounts are okay, but I cannot speak to their longevity quite yet. They do hold nice and tight, and are easy to adjust. Good design, but the material is rather cheap. All of the threads on the hardware were a little finicky and I would advise using the grease and some care to not cross thread anything. I'm hoping that this will get better as they break in and get used more. The hardware is functional but will leave a more advanced player wanting more.                
This kit is definitely worth what I payed. If I could have purchased just the Shell pack for $599 it would have been even better, but I am satisfied with what I got for what was payed. The hardware pack is somewhat of a let down but is functional for now.                
I have not dealt directly with the company, but am awaiting an email from zZounds about some replacement kick drum lugs to replace the ones that were damaged in shipping. Hopefully they come through.                
The overall look and presence of this kit is sharp. Very presentable for gigs, but still affordable. It's modern and sounds very good for it's price point.                
I recently decided to pull the trigger on this drum set. It was a long time coming, and I was definitely due for a fresh kit. After a long debate between several different kits available, I decided to go for it. I play in several bands and play gigs regularly. I needed something that sounds good, but that I am okay with taking out of the studio. I also was hoping to spend less than 1k. I had some doubts and reservations but am happy to say that I think it was a good choice. When I received this in the mail there were two holes in the box, and without opening it I could see that some of the kick drum lugs were damaged during shipping. Mostly cosmetic, but it was a bummer. We will see if crush will make it right, but for now it plays fine as is. The factory packaging is pretty weak and I would imagine this is not an isolated incident.                
This speaker is very true to what you put in. No frequencies are hyped across the guitar spectrum but yet it still sounds like a good guitar speaker and not sterile or hi-fi. Has the openness of the American speakers but retains some British smoothness. In my opinion one of the most versatile speakers Celestion makes. High end is crisp and present but not piercing and the low end is full but not loose.
Highly recommended!                
I am a Marshall DSL 40C owner,even after removing the C19 cap its still has a lot of high end harshness because of the 70/80 celestion stock speaker it came with. After installing the A-type 16 ohm,I now have a much warmer low end omph,relax mids,much fuller over all sound with a sweeter high's and still retains that Marshall sound that I dig alot! I thought about an Eminence but to my experience,Marshall and Celestion go well together for the sound I'm going for and also the SM57 seems to be much more friendlier on picking up those combination on a live gig situation, with very little tweaking done. I mainly use 90% bridge humbucker(Dimarzio PAF Pro) on alder body maple neck. Sound" IS" subjective but I really dig my live results. Highly recommend it,especially for Marshall amps...                
I replaced the stock celestions in my Blackstar HT Stage 60 and what a different amp. The amp really came alive. Crisp highs, punchy mids and great bottom end. Well worth the investment.                 
There speakers and reproduce the sound to it's full potential                
Again there speakers. Easy to replace. Just make sure you know the correct ohms 8 or 16                
Never had a failure with a celestion                
For the difference in the sound. Worth every penny                
Haven't had to use there support                
Again, when I replaced the stock 70/80 celestions. I couldn't beleive the how much better my amp sounds                
I would replace them tomorrow                
Wanted to take my Rivera 100 Duo Twelve back to close as original as I could and these were recommended as replacements. They sound great, no flutter in the lows and crisp and clear in the highs.                
I put this in a Vox Pathfinder 15r combo amp and after a 80% break in period I notice this speaker was louder and clearer even with max volume, I have a 2nd Pathfinder with original speaker in it to compare. This definitely has that Celestion sound, kinda G12h30 meets an Alnico Blue vibe to it. Takes distortion/effects well. Just clear as a bell. What can I say I'm very impressed how full and loud this sounds for a 8" speaker. The advances we have today in musical gear is amazing ! Buy this speaker its a worthy upgrade.                
I bought this to replace the stock 'Gold Back' speaker in a 1997 Marshall Valvestate VS15R. The 'Gold Back' is typical of the lower grade OEM Celestion speakers. It didn't sound bad but it didn't really sound "great". This little amp kicks but I knew it could sound better. Upon opening the box I immediately noticed the metal frame on the 'Eight 15' was thicker and felt more substantial than the 'Gold Back'. The improvement in tone was undeniable. Now, granted the Gold Back was 21 years old, but... With the 'Eight 15' the highs were more sparkly and generally had more presence in all settings. I know it will only sound "more better" once the break-in is complete. (I used an HSH Fender Strat with a coil splitter.) The VS15R is unique in that it has dual pre-gains. I dimed both pre-gains and the amp howled like a wild animal. I can only comment on this one amp and speaker combo but it was a huge improvement. And for $29, it was a purchase with great economic value.                
I got this to drop into my Fender Mustang I that I keep handy in my bedroom. Even though this speaker is only rated at 15w, it handles the amp which is rated at 20w without blinking an eye! The more power I give it the better it sounds. It totally opened up my amp sonically. I had recently put a set of Seymour Duncan Seth Lover's in my Epi Les Paul, and although they sounded great, they just seemed to fall flat. In came this unassuming little Celestion speaker and BAM! I don't think that I could ever ask for a better sound out of the rig I'm running. Crunchiness is so nice and open now but it sounds just as good when I back off and clean it up. I cannot recommend this speaker any higher. Thirty bucks made my Fender Mustang sound like a Marshall. Getcha Some!                
i bought this speaker for my small marshall mg15cfx practice amp. the stock speaker started to crackle during strumming and bassy notes. i figured i would take a chance and replace the speaker. i ordered the 8 ohm version and received in a couple of days. originally it looked like the screw holes weren't going to line up but they did. now i have not had a chance to break in the speaker yet, but already it sounds significantly better than the stock speaker was (even at its best). it is a cleaner, clearer sound. Anyways what I'm trying to say is that if you are thinking about a replacement speaker for a cheap practice amp, you can't go wrong with this. It is really a fantastic speaker for the price. The only reminder I will give is that it is only rated for 15 watts, so if you have a 15 watt speaker and use overdrive pedals and crank the amp, you might want to look for a 20-25 watt speaker instead. but as long as you're not aiming every dial, this speaker should do just fine! do yourself a favor and try it. i am sure happy i did.                
For the 15" woofers in my Mackie Thump 15s. The difference between these speakers and the stock speakers is truly remarkable. I was running a sub at 120hz. before acquiring these and now I will only drag my sub out for outdoor gigs in the park. The clarity of the midrange is immediately there, and the tight, solid bass is much improved over the stock item. I heartily recommend....and you need to buy from zZounds. I am a long time satisfied customer and they will always "do you right." The "wow factor" and "manufacturer support" are all about a solid and reliable speaker which needs no "support." Mine works perfectly, so I have not contacted the manufacturer....if I did, it would be to thank them for giving out excellence with value.                
I thought there was no way the sound of my Fender Super Champ X2 could be improved on, I was wrong. With this speaker, (even though it's made in China) in my treasured Super Champ the sound quality is just so unreal. I will gladly put my Super Champ head to head with any so-called "boutique" amps anytime, anywhere. All guitar players out there that are obsessive-compulsive about tone quality like I am, you need this combo...                
I'm using these in a 4X10 closed back cab. They're very musical, full range, without being "hi-fi". I'm a roots player - blues, alt-country. No shred. No metal. For what I'm doing, these are the best I've ever used.                
They seem to be really well made. Nice heavy baskets. They've been completely reliable.                 
Excellent value.                 
The search is over.                 
I put this in a Fender Super Champ XD and i could not believe the improvement in sound , depth and accuracy of the amp emulating features.  Warm , rich sound with great bass, mids and highs and almost the depth of 12 inch speaker.                
suprisingly good made in china celestion                
For what you get with this speaker, it is a total value.                
never had an issue                
Incredible sounding speaker, best 10 inch on the market.                
I purchased this at the same time as a Vox AC4C1-12 in order to replace the stock speaker.When I first heard the stock Vox branded Celestion V-Type, I regretted buying the G12-35XC.Once I installed it though,.. all regrets were gone.This is a nice speaker, very vintage sounding in this amp, but holds up to dirt WELL. It tamed the slight harshness on the Vox, that I knew was going to be there.I would recommend this speaker for just about any style except metal, stick to the Vintage 30s and G12T-75s for that. From jazz to hard rock though, no problem. I have never owned any Pulsonic coned speakers, so I cannot really judge their authenticity or "mojo" in that department. I like it.                
Great 4 12 tone from a single 12. Balls bass treble and clean. I did a 3 hour break in period before taking it through its paces                
I bought the Celestion G12H75 Creamback 16Ω to pair with a Vintage 30 16Ω in a new empty 2x12 cabinet with a two thirds closed 1/3rd open back at 8Ω. I play through a Marshall head and use Gibson Les Pauls and the tone is great! I also have a 4x12 Marshall cabi et with 2 greenbacks and 2 Vintage 30s. I have not played through the 4x12 since getting this speaker. The speaker has a lot of bass and needs to be mixed with a Vintage 30 or other similar speaker to balance the bass a little. The Creamback has a nice and clean sound perfect for classic rock.                
Very clear and musical.  Celestion nailed it with this speaker that would suit anyone's playing style.                
Features?  Tone, tone, tone.                
Install was pretty straight forward in my Peavey Classic 30.                
The speaker seems well made from China.                 
For $125.00 this thing is a steal.  I am now thinking of building my own 2x12 cabinate and plan on using at least one greenback in it.                
Haven't had to deal with support.                
Not sure if I would try a different brand from now on.  Celestion is a tone junkie's dealer.                
I have a Peavey Classic 30 and a '80 Led Paul custom.  The Blue Marvel speaker that came with the amp always had that ice picky sound to it.  I began a quest for tone (never ending for guitar players).   Changed out the original 490 humbucker and SD Allen Holdsworth model for classic '57 & '57 plus.  Then started looking at the amp. The amount of replacement speakers can be overwhelming however I kept coming back to the greenback.  I just couldn't find anything close for this price range.  I wanted a classic sound with a little bit of bite to it.  I plugged in my DS-1 and with a couple of adjustments from EQ I was in tonal eargasm.   This is a very nicely balanced sounding speaker that also sounds awesome clean or dirty.  Also I have to say that living in NJ helped with shipping.  I ordered Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon it was on my door step.                
This is a nicely balanced speaker with good full bass, killer mids and warm, clear highs.                
Great components make great sound.                
It's a speaker!                
Nice heavy-duty chassis and good overall construction.                
I only paid $100.00 new for this and am very satisfied with the product.                
Haven't dealt with them.                
If you're a guitarist on the eternal quest for tone- don't ignore your speakers! The Greenback has dramatically changed and improved the sound of my amp. Highly recommended.                
I think I'll be quite satisfied for awhile.                
Excellent classic rock and blues sound.  I put 2 of these in a home made 2x12 cabinet and they sound awesome.                
Its a speaker - has everything it needs.                
Getting a wide range of sounds that suit my needs, particularly rock and blues                
No probelems with quality so far.  Expect them to last 20 years at least!                
Got them for $159 each in Australia.  Very competitive price.                
Haven't needed support                
If you want the classic rock guitar sounds - get it!                
I'll be keeping these for a long time.                
I have an older berhinger 412 cab that i bought that came with jensens...i replaced with the g12t-75s and it blew my mind. I plugged in to my friends peavey 412 cab and it sounded good but not as good as mine loaded with the celestions....worth every penney if you treasure your tone..(i play in a metal band)                
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING GUITAR FOR MANY MOONS-I PUT THIS SPEAKER IN MY FENDER STUDIO 85-IT OPENED UP THE AMP WITH INCREDIBLE SOUND-THIS AMP SOUNDS AS GOOD AS MY CARVIN WITH THIS SPEAKER-BUY IT-IT WILL MAKE YOUR SOUND BE GREAT                
there's a lot of bass                
nothing that any speaker wouldnt have                
i think this speaker was made really well because it has been in marshall cabs for years now, i dont see how it could break unless someone mis-treated it                
i would like to see the price go down                
neveer dealt with celestion                
its silver, so much better than black                
everything about this speaker makes playing guitar a better experience. This speaker and the vintage 30 are the top for metal, in my opinion.                
I Bought a pair to run off my guitar rack. I admit- I am running a solid state rack-mountable amp into them, but I use a Rocktron Gainiac as a pre- and they sound spectacular (for metal and leads). Due to the fact that I play Ibanez, I really wanted to capture the potential high gain aspects of the system, and these Celestions do very well in this build. Gosh, do they 'break up' nice!
BTW- They do sound rather sweet on a really clean (touch of re-verb) channel also.                
I bought them used (fearfully)from a local used equipment shop. Lucky for me- they dont seem to have the typical characteristics of an abused speaker.                
Bolted right in to my custom twin cab                
Um.... has anyone ever heard of Marshall? They speak for themselves. Never a problem- even when pushed hard                
Spendy, but you buy these one time (unless you decide to trash them for fun- then they are spendy twice)                
Never had to call them.                
These are perfect for what I would call an 'ideal' speaker. Sexy? absolutly when you send high gain patches through them.                
I love these. Thank you Celestian.                
defined bass, sweet highs                
would have given a 10, but they aren't cheap  :)                
i installed 4 (16 Ohm-100 Watt version) of these in a slant cab, powered by a Peavey Ultragain Pro head (predecessor of the XXL)- all knobs to 11..  sounds killer...  turned my flubby crap sound into defined hardcore glory, great lows, mellow highs..  from chugga to rippin solos                
good when and if it works at a low range,                
if and when it worked, it was good.                
bought these speakers to replace existing 16 ohm to 8 ohm to match impeadance for the amp head, looked good out of the box, 4 months into light usage, one of the speakers starts to frame buzz. warranty is another issue, celestion manufactures in china, typical chinese quality-junk-my 16 ohm speakers never had this issue.                
to pay this much for poor quality is not a good value.                
trying to get warranty support out celestion, good luck.                
will replace with other manufacturer, or look for non chinese made clelestions.............                
Great speaker for blues to Metal                
THESE SPEAKERS HAVE THE BEST OVERALL TONE OF ANY SPEAKERS I HAVE OWNED (AND I'VE OWNED MANY). THEY HAVE A BEEFY SOUND THAT CARRIES FULL RANGE WITHOUT ANY SHRILLNESS OR EAR FATIGUE. THEY OPERATE WELL AT ALL VOLUMES, CLEAN OR OVERDRIVEN. WHEN OVERDRIVEN (I USE A MESA HEAD) THEY JUST BLOW THE ROOF OFF THE DUMP. BEST SPEAKERS EVER, AND WORTH THE OUTSIZED CELESTION PRICE.                
JUST SCREW THEM DOWN AND PLUG IN...AAAAHHHHH, THE POWER OF TONE!                
FLAWLESS. I HAVE HAULED THEM ALL OVER THE LANDSCAPE AND HAVE USED THEM NOW IN THREE-FOUR DIFFERENT CABS WITH NO PROBLEMS.                
NOTHING CELESTION PRODUCES WOULD BE CONSIDERED VALUE--TO GET THE BEST, YA GOTTA PAY FOR IT. AND YOU DO WITH THESE, BUT WELL WORTH IT!                
TONE RULES, AND THESE PRODUCE THE MOST DESIRABLE TONE EVER.                
I BELIEVE THESE ARE THE LAST SPEAKERS I'LL EVER NEED.                
Excellent speaker, glad I purchased,sounds round,full and vibrant, perhaps Celestion's best speaker.                
great                
nice sparkle and tone no recone kit available                
easyy                
good                
175                
The Worst                
very wow                
Hello FolksI love the Celestion Gold and it is definitely one of the best sounding speakers in the industry. I have a shop in The Nashville area and have sold over 100 on E bay.Recently I had a customer blow one of the speakers it was obviously abused but I'm like Sam Wal take care of the customer and he'll send you 10 more for treating him right.Well when I heard back from Celestion they told me they could offer me another speaker for a whopping 25 dollars off of what I normally pay. I asked them about re-coning it and they said re-cone kits are not available??? What The Hell you've got to be kidding so if you blow one of your celestion Golds you've got a very expensive door stop. It's really a shame that they just don't get it in my 30 years of selling speakers I've never heard of such a dumb thing. So if your Celestion Gold is starting to get a bit Fatigued be prepared to buy a new one unless you want to drop some aftermarket Chinese kit in it.I've decided not to sell them anymore because of their poor customer service I can't afford to take care of my customers especially knowing now there are no re-cone kits available for such a fine Speaker/Cajun Man Nashville TN                
on a scale of 1-10, the alnico gold 12 is a 10! everything else i've tried comes in at a 6.                
worth every dime.                
they were hard to reach,unfriendly and i'm not convinced they know what they're talking about, at least at the 2 u.s. numbers.                
i did'nt give you a $ amount above because i'll be buying 3 more.                
This speaker is not an unattainable gem like the JBL 120's. If it gets destroyed just buy another. REcone kits are very expensive and hard to do. Its only for the domain of vintage speakers that are no longer made. Its much easier to buy a new one than try to recone it or pay someone to do it.                
The clarity is amazing at all volume levels. They also have one of the tightest attacks making them great for blues and jazz. The pair I got replaced the Line 6 speakers that came in my Flextone II, and these sound hundreds of times better, and they handle every amp model with pristine tone and clarity.                 
Definitely one of the best sounding speakers for guitarist. Celestions pressed steal construction and higher quality voice-coil should give you a lifetime of great tone if matched to the right power.                
These speakers are full of value. Well worth the price. Most of Celestion products hold a great value but these are one of the best. I was torn between this and the greenbacks, but I'm glad I got these. After hearing them I'd definitely be willing to pay more than what I did for them.                
Great product for a good price, from a great company. Overall I'm very satisfied with these speakers and I will be for some time. They brought new life into my older Flextone II, and I look forward to many more years of enjoyment.                
Bought this speaker to replace an oem Celestion 70/80 in an open back 1x12 cabinet. At 90 watts this speaker adds some headroom over most oem speakers. I expected some improvement but not the immediately audible quality increase. All highs whether played clean or with drive are more articulate and sweeter. More mids presence without any overbearing extra coloration of any frequency. 
Buy alnico. In my opinion this is one of the best gear buys I have made in over 40 years of professional playing.                
Haven't really heard anything about these speakers but I thought I'd try one out and wow! Put this speaker in a little 1x12 I use with my Bugera T50 and it sounds great! Now comparatively, the speaker that was in the 1 x 12 had seen its days. It didn't sound horrible but it wasn't that great either. The super 65 has a nice tight sound, and gets loud as hell! I've played through plenty of different cabinets before but never knew what model speaker was loaded in them so I can't really make a comparison between speakers. Kind of curious to see what they would sound like loaded into a 412. For the price you just can't go wrong. And I'm very happy with this speaker!                
I also used two of these bad boys to swap into my Bugera 212. Night and day difference! Great tone, crisp, clean, loud, and most importantly afforable. Super happy with this purchase. Even better than I expected!                
I learned years ago that speakers make a huge difference in shaping your sound. When I buy a new 2x12 combo or cab, I always pair one of these with a Celestion Vintage 30. With that combination I believe you will get the best sound out of your amp. The Creamback paired with the Vintage 30 have all based covered from bass, mid & treble frequencies. You just can't find a better combination with these Celestion speakers. Thank you zZounds for your excellent customer service and pay as you play plans. No other seller of great gear beats you guys! 2 thumbs up!                
My Marshall DSL 40 was too bright and tinny and I had to keep the treble and bass on 2 and the presence off. I put in the Creamback and now I have all controls at midnight, I can now add or subtract as desired, but it sounds great where they are..It brings out the character of my AM Strat and Mex Tele. I love my amp now. I play Rush, AC/DC, Billy Squire, old school metal etc,,,The speaker has that style of midrange punch. Very close to my old dsl 50 half stack. Kudos to ZZounds also as I got the speaker in 3 days!                
I installed the Celestion G12M-65 Creamback Speaker into my Deluxe Reverb.  It opens up nicely and allows just enough bite to come through.  If you play Country, Rock, Surf Sounds, and more, you will love this speaker.                
I use it in front of the clean channel on my Marshall DSL15C and/or DSL40C (added Creambacks to both and replaced V1, V2 and V3 stock valves w/Electroharminix 12AX7's and they both sound amazing w/tons of natural compression) witch turns them into virtual TSL's. I'm stoked with it!                
Bought a pair of these for my Orange DT30H. These are great if you want to use a 2x12 cabinet. The extra power allows them to handle low frequencies better than the greenbacks. The DT30H has a real punchy midrange in fact, I thought it was too much when I tried it with the Vintage 30s but this speaker really brought out the personality in the amp. It has a nice well rounded frequency response when played clean and has a smooth (not harsh) distortion.                
First off, I DID NOT buy this speaker for a top notch amp. I bought it to replace the stock speaker in my Fender 25R practice amp. As one can already assume, the sound is thicker with the Celestion. It cleared the low end and cleaned up the grainy top end. I would have used this speaker in a tube amp if it required a 10" speaker. However, I'm a big fan of Celestion from their Vintage 30V in my tube amp. This is a no brainer when it comes to replacing stock amp speakers.                
I am a professional musician. I use a Gallien Kreuger MLE208 for most of my smaller jobs. After years of service the speakers were shot so I was looking around for a suitable replacement. I noticed that the new Quilter 100 watt amps were using these Celestion 8 inch speakers successfully. I did some research and decided to buy two from zZounds. As usual the sales person was friendly and knowledgeable . The online purchase process was quick and easy and the shipping was almost as fast.
Installing the speakers was a bit of a chore since the amp has a metal encloser that has a billion screws holding it together. But once I got it apart everything went smoothly.The speaker terminals are clearly marked for plus and minus so there was no problem connecting them correctly. I was pleasantly surprised at the sound. The new speakers seem to be more efficient than the old ones with every note "speaking" clearly with no annoying overtones or bass woofing. I don't have to turn up the amp as far as I did before and when I do turn it up the sound doesn't distort until a much higher volume than before. All in all I would recommend these speakers to anyone who needs a good 8 inch speaker for PA or guitar use.                
I put this speaker in my Tech21 Trademark 10. The stock speaker is like most 8" that come in low powered solid state amps, just OK. Farts at louder volumes and breaks up excessively when you run a moderate amount of bass. However, I put this little guy in and it's awesome. A lot louder and you can actually get clean sounds at higher volumes. It sounds very balanced and as big as a tiny 8" speaker can. I love it                
I purchased these as replacements on a Rivera M60 2x10 combo. I took a chance on these based on reviews and demos on the internet. These did change the sound of my amp for the better. These are not cheap speakers and ZZounds made it possible for me to experiment with my amp. I 'm very happy with the way they sound. If you have good gear, it only makes sense to have good speakers to complete your sound.I did not need manufacturers support. Speakers are an easy install.                
Upgraded the factory speaker in my Marshall DSL 40c with the vintage 30. The difference is knight and day . Have used this speaker in many amps, boxes with everything from blues to metal and it performs! There is a reason you see the vintage thirty in almost all the top shelf rigs out there. It lives up to its reputation, stop thinking about it and buy it now ! You want regret it ...                
This is a great speaker for rock, tight low end, present midrange and smooth highs. Some folks are off put by the "upper mid spike" but in the right amp or paired with the right speaker this compliments the tone beautifully instead of being an annoyance. Great articulate sounding speaker. Highly recommend pairing it with a Swamp Thang in a 2x12.                
I have this speaker in my Fender Hot Rod Deluxe. I play Country Music along with my Fender Telecaster. This combination is very clean, powerful , and loaded with tone. I plan to replace the Black Widows in my Twin Reverb with Vintage 30's very soon!                
The speaker is very well built and looks as good as it sounds. It carries itself perfectly in my kind of music.                
This speaker in conjunction with my Hot Rod Deluxe is a very reliable, powerful combination suitable for any gig. I've used it outside, in ballrooms, and on our last cd. No disappointments whatsoever!                
The value is surprisingly great considering the low price.                
No. I haven't dealt with them.                
It's fantastic.                
Ten years or more. I thought I was happy with the Peavey Black Widows in my Twin until I bought my Hot Rod Deluxe with the Celestion Vintage 30. I only hope my Twin sounds as good with a pair of Vintage 30's in them.                
Good price. zZounds beat others for me. Shipped lightning quick. Installed in minutes. The tones coming from the Firebird, renewed HT5R and Boss distortion pedal were shockingly improved. The '16 'bird HP pups are a perfect match for me. The Schecter Banshee elite FR-S was more subdued after the V30 swap, but improved in crunchy tones and power chords. It's all relative, and your mileage will vary, but exetremely pleased with purchase from zZ.                
These vintage 30's sound amazing! Excellent sound quality. You will get good low end and mid range from these speakers and the highs sound great as well. I can play all styles of music with these speakers and you can, too.                
These speakers really don't have any special features, but the magnet is much bigger than the stock speaker that I replaced.                
When I first took these speakers out of the box I could tell that I had some very well made speakers. I email Celestion before buying these speakers because they were made in China. They explained that the factory uses the same quality parts as they use in England. So, don't worry. Not even about the glue that is used!                 
These speakers are worth the price. Every bit.                
They answer emails right away and will tell you what speaker to buy and not to buy.                
IMO, these are the best replacement speakers that one can buy. I put these speakers in my Genz Benz G Flex 2X12 cabinet. Now I have that Rectifier sound without the huge price tag. The way that the G Flex cabinet is baffled, the Celestion Vintage 30 60watt speakers produce a sound that will make you hate to put your guitar down!                
weak highs no bass mostly mids I have heard them with many amps just not much tone I replaced mine with celestion 70's great change 12m70 tone monsters 2 12 50 watt carvin.                
made well even dose the job just not with my style I USE P90'S AND A HEAVY MID RANGE SPEAKER IS NOT GOOD.                
Outstanding sound clarity, bass response, and tightness when pushed hard.  I have two of them in a cab hooked up to various amps.  They can bring out the best of any amp, especially sweet Fender cleans--but they sound great with anything.                
Great price for the sound quality.                
A 2x12 cab loaded with these speakers revitalized all my amps.  I have mostly Vox and Fender tube amps, and the clarity and punch I get from adding these speakers to any rig is outstanding.  Great buy.                
This is hands down one of the finest guitars I have ever owned! It is capable of producing an exceptionally broad range of tones, all of which are very usable and capable of covering virtually any style of music. The neck is super fast and just feels great, effortless to play for long periods of time. The guitar is just loaded with features, all of which are very pragmatic, its obvious there was a ton of thought put into this build. I would say it is as fine a working mans guitar as you can come by. The tremelo is rock solid, intonation is fantastic in all registers, there isnt a single spot on the neck that is cumbersome to reach. The pickups sound incredible and can dial in everything from sweet bluesy single coil tones to full on shred. Lastly, I personally love the aesthetics of this axe, its not overly flashy but is undeniably beautiful in an earthy kind of way. Natural roasted finish is off the hook. I really couldn't be happier. If you are a working musician looking for an exceptionally functional yet highly refined guitar this is definitely one to consider. You wont be disappointed!                 
Bought one a few months ago and it absolutely solves every problem I’ve had with gigging here in the Florida weather. Rarely goes out of tune, plays and sounds like a sweet dream and rarely break string anymore due to the redesigned Floyd. I can open the case and play no matter if it’s 50 and dry out or 100 and muggy. The only issue I have is the bridge. If you over bend strings like I do expect to be pulling the high E right out of the saddle. I’ve had it inspected and nothing is wrong, it’s just a weak point in the design. Charvel support had no viable solution for this, maybe I’m the only guy out there overbending this thing                 
sound quality is 10 out of 10 being compared with a Strat and an Ibanez JEM and using the same rig each time with same settings                
Not a lot of features .........tremelo or multiple knobs.  Just a volume knob and that's all this instrument needed                
Just plug it in and play..........right out of the box it perfect                
Yes, made well and I'm familiar with Charvel dating back to the 80's. I never had a problem with the San Dimas originals and they were played hard and long for years                
I thought it was a little expensive but then again it is also the best in my collection of high quality instruments and has top billing. I cannot imagine what would play and sound better                 
Yes ,we go way back to the 80's when I owned 4 of them at the same time. I was a good client with this company and they have always been good to me                
5 out of 5 stars .  Looks great and sounds even better                
Outstanding instrument in every way...........I bought one last month and have played it  every single day and there are zero issues.  I own a Srtat and Ibanez        ( JEM 77P ) and had owned 4 Charvels circa 1980's San Dimas originals. I debated buying a Charvel as I believed there was no way they would or could match the 80's models and I'm here to say this one has proved me wrong thankfully !  This has quickly become the go-to instrument of choice and it had tough competition with the JEM 77P.   But facts are facts and this rather expensive instrument has won hands down. I've played guitar since the 80's and am building a recording studio this year and this will be used for recording purposes no doubt.  zZounds has been completely excellent to work with answering any questions and getting the products shipped quickly and with no damage whatsoever.  I spent a lot of time comparison shopping in the past and turns out there was no point . They have provided me with a Marshall Cabinet  , Egnater amp , wireless setup and now this guitar.  I honestly won't hesitate to buy again when the time is right !                
My Jim Root has EMG's so I was wanting something more expressive. The hard mounted JB/59 combo really does sound very well with this wood and weight. Plugged into my 100 watt Peavy Windsor head and stomped on my Vai Wah. really nice tone. I'm a big Jake E Lee fan and the tone kind of reminded me of his tone off of Dusk. Raw and clear but distorted. Cant wait to experiment with the set up a bit more.                
The neck is really cool. Its wider than my Fender JR across the fretboard but the back isnt any thicker. It was unusual at first but after a god hour I had myself in the pocket and adjusted to the differences. If you like Ibanez necks, you would ALMOST be at home on this. Split coil is cool as I love a good single coil neck tone and adds more tonal dimension ala the 6 pack of sound. (YOUTUBE THAT)                
This thing was in tune out of the box. Again after adjusting to the wider neck I was off to the races. The Floyd works as it should and I'll have to re-learn my trem tricks as I've been away from it since I've been on the Jim Root for so long.                
Man I gotta say I stumbled on Made in Mexico guitars by mistake 3 years ago with my Root Tele. That guitar was so well made I knew for my price range I was getting another MIM guitar. This one again, is so well crafted I'm really suprised at how well the Mexico factory does for the price point. Its a beautiful guitar in person that immediately gave off an EVH kind of vibe to it. FRETS, WOODWORK,AND ELECTRONICS all in perfect condition.                
I think this thing is worth much more and very suprised it isnt at least a grand. Top notch build, great components, great specs. It's worth the price for sure.                
I have not ever dealt with Charvel. But I'm a longstanding customer and advocate of zZounds. The one time I ordered a dream guitar "Les Paul" I recieved it packed expertly as usual but the build quality was so bad I sent it back. zZounds didnt even flich. Let me send it back and chose an SRV Strat instead. I am poor and if it werent for zZounds pay 2 play plan I wouldnt  have any of the awesome gear I do now.                
Well its woody looking and I dig that. The picture that is in the zZounds page is a little bit darker than what I got. Which is cool as it matches closer to the lighter maple fretboard. So much like the Jim Root Tele, this Charvel Style 2 is hot rodded tele that you just dont see everyday. with some fantastic meaty pickups directly mounted to the wood, a Floyd Rose and all that beautiful wood grain this thing wow's. Even my girlfriend dug it.                
It came down to this Style 2 and a Wolfgang. After reviewing hundreds of youtube reviews and demo's and Guitar forum reviews I pulled the trigger based on a few things. First and foremost, reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. To be honest the only negatives were because the headstock wasnt a tele or there isnt a case. I have a Fender Jim Root Tele that is bad ass and also made in Mexico. So I kind of figured the build quality was going to be on point and it was.                   
I'm blown away. The quality, looks, and playability are simply the best. The pickups are powerful and the coil tapping gives it complete versatility.Not much I own or have owned even compare. This axx is in a class by itself. Charvel has always made an excellent guitar, but this new Pro Mod......well thy have outdone themselves!!                
I’ve played guitar for 22 years. Owned everything from a Les Paul, strat, Tele, superstrat, sg all the way to flying v’s and stupid BC Rich guitar. Always stick with heavier music. While this guitar doesn’t leave the best access to the highest frets, everything else about it is a perfect mix of smooth tone, sustain and a fast neck. Pickups sound awesome through an array of different amps, playing clean and heavy. Do yourself a favor and buy this guitar.                
First off I chose the Black one with the trans top, It looks great. I was excited and nervous at the same time. I have a lot of Fender Strats, and wanted something, hotter and definitely built to shred. This guitar does not disappoint. Out of the box it was pretty much in tune. The setup was first rate, low action, no buzz and the Floyd was Level with the body. I played the guitar for about 45 minutes unplugged to hear and feel its resonance. I liked what I was hearing and feeling. The guitar is gorgeous and the neck is really the star of the show. Not too thin and very slick, it appears to have a minimal finish (satin maybe). It just feels right. The fit and finish on this guitar are amazing, I have many USA Guitars and this guitar is really on that level of craftsmanship. Now lets plug this thing in, I played the clean channel on my Hughes and Kettner Matrix, and it sounded very nice great body of tone with crisp highs and even low sounds. The pickups respond well to volume adjustment to lower the gain or even clean (usable) for you guys that just run wide open and used the volume to control your rig. I liked the coil tap, you can get stratty tones  that you get from a single coil. There are a lot of tonal variations to be had, if you have to chose only one guitar to get you through a gig, this guitar covers a lot of sonic territory. This guitar is not just for metal or hard rock. It is a serious, versatile instrument! I bought this one to see how Charvel was building super strats and I am already planning to buy another. I took advantage of the payment plan, you can too... get it today and play on. CJWII                
fit and finish is flawless, color choices are great (i got specific ocean which is like a metal flaked surf green), features are plenty (the floyd 1000 works perfectly and the tuners seem fine), play-ability is top notch (amazing smooth necks on these), sounds are incredible (the coil splits and 59/jb are a great combo on this guitar and i can't see upgrading them, and i typically run pearly gates and emg's in my guitars). can't go wrong with these guitars if you're in the market for a high end super strat. i'm not a shredder...i'm more blues rock and jam-oriented and this guitar suits me perfectly...ignore the stereotypes! on the quality-side, the fender ensenada factory build amazing instruments for the price tag and honestly this charvel puts my old fender classic series 72 thinline to shame (same factory and the 72 is built great, but charvel is in a different league). they should come with a case and the action was a touch high for me (not a fault of zZounds or charvel as i prefer very low action), but that's honestly the only downside. highly rec'd from a long-time player and actively gigging musician and gear nerd.                
best made in mexico super strat charvel sounds just as good as a jap or a usa great tone and tap coil, neck is raw and fast, maple sounds killer !! buy it                
I purchased the black burst sand dimas around 2 weeks ago, when the guitar got here the paint was cracked and checking. I asked zZounds to exchange it for another one and when the replacement guitar got here, the same issue was present. 2 charvel have had the same exact poor QC. That is not quality and certainly is not worth $900. I would stay away from Charvel guitars until they fix this issue. I wont be purchasing anymore charvel instruments.                
Very good fit and finish. Could'nt find a blemish anywhere. My only regret is not getting the seafoam green                
I could not be happier with this guitar. The action was nice rite out of the box. The tone is perfect. It is nice and light, sometimes I play for like 4 hours at a time and hardly feel it on. I like to think of this guitar as my Steve Via signature without the monkey grip and $2000 cheap with same quality. I Am in love with zZounds. I donated my guitar due to not enough hands to carry stuff. Was going nuts without it!!!! I went from zero to three guitars in 4 months thanks to the payment option... my first two guitars came the next day!!! I just wish that some of the guitar company’s would at least through in a gig bag.......                
I have 4000 dollar guitars that do not sound nor play as good as this Charvel does. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a strat body , with the sound and feel of a Charvel . Best guitar I own by far.                
I had a JP16 but I got rid of it because I was not a fan of the pickups and overall tone of the guitar. For it's price point I did not feel it was worth it to spend money on swapping pickups. I did miss how incredibly comfortable the guitar was, especially the neck. That is where this Charvel comes in. They had one at my local store and grabbed it on a whim. Wow, the neck felt fantastic and even though my guitars are usually black I found the satin orange very appealing. I ordered mine from zZounds and have had it a few days and I have no regrets. The guitar was reasonably set up and looked perfect. Some new strings, some stretching and into my Helix and 2x12 Randall with EVM 12L Black Labels. I was very impressed with the sound from the SD Full Shred and Alnico II pickups. The guitar offers a nice variety of tones with the 5 way selector and the volume pot is very smooth with almost too little drag. The neck joint/heel are very comfortable and the tremolo works well with the locking tuners. The neck is slim and actually has a hint of maple scent to it. I mentioned the JP16 earlier because after owning it and now this DK-24 I feel this is a very similar guitar for about $1500 less.Only a few differences: Electronics/pups, SS frets, USAmodel) Neck profile, feel, comfort, playabilty are almost identical. Both are great guitars and if you do not have budget limitations by all means get the JP16, get both lol. All joking aside though this DK-24 is a serious guitar and a great value at this price point.                
I love this guitar, have no complaints at all. It stays in tune perfectly and the neck feels amazing. For some Duncan Design pickups they sound really good I wouldn't even consider switching them out. Everything feels solid on this guitar. I love this guitar so much couldn't be happier with this purchase.                
The microphone is very sensitive. You can talk and it responds.                 
The gig bag is a nice addition. Its always nice to have storage for your gear. Especially this awesome fixture.                
Just plug it in and watch the magic. Everything comes ready to go. Not much to do unless u plan to put a dmx controller on it.                 
I have other chauvet products so I knew the quality would be great. Can never go wrong with chauvet.                
This light is worth every penny.                 
When u see it you go ok is that it. Then u turn it on and you go this is the most awesome thing I've seen since transformers.                 
Overall this thing rocks. The 4 seemingly liittle lights make it seem like u have an entire light show. it covers a HUGE area and the leds r super bright. U will not regret gettin this as an addition or centerpiece or just using it by itself.                 
No sound w/ this product.  n/A                
Come with a carrying bag.  I added O clamps to the bar, and the bag isn't big enough for them.                
Plug and play... I don't have a dmx controller yet, however the sensitivity control and programming was super easy to figure out.                
Looks solid, lights are bright and people enjoyed the show.                
4 lights in one bar basically... can't go wrong.                
N/A, haven't needed any support                
I like being able to point the cans where i want and fillin the dance floor.  I got 2 for each side of my stand.                
I have a karaoke/Dj business & these lights work GREAT for this!!! I have had one for almost a year & have yet to replace a light. Just bought a second one for my other system. I would recommend these lights to everyone!!!                
No Sound.  It lighting effects                
Love the gear bag included.                
Mount it on your speaker pole, or light stand.  Simple.  Then adjust the lights to cover what-ever area you need lit up.                
No problems yet.  Hassle free.  Love the extra power outlet so I can run my lasers off of it as well.                
No complaints about the value.  It adds so much to my show...  Priceless.                
Haven't had to call for support.                
Exceptional addition to my light show.                 
Love'em.  Recommended to anyone who needs some flash in your show without using gobs of amperage or adding gobs heat to the stage area.                
No sound                
Very simple, plug and play, linked two together,awesome light show !                
Set up is quick,easy to understand readout.                
So far, so good. Time will tell when I get some hours on these lights.                
Well worth the money, these lights compliment any laser.                
none needed yet.                
Every mobile DJ should have at least one.                
I'll use these untill they crap out, then buy more.                
Got my new Chauvet 4PLAY Moonflower Light Bar, and I could not be more thrilled with it. Can't wait to hit my next gig                
The 4play is everything that was advertised. It is a great compliment to the 4bar. I wish it could be controlled by the 4bar foot switch.                
I don't use the DMX controller, yet. I was surprised that the programming is limited and different from the 4bar. I wish there were some tips/hints as to the proper setup and directing of the lights in a live band situation/gig.                
Seems to be very durable                
I would recomend this product to others                
I have not dealt with the company. But am confident there woudld be no problems given the quality of the product.                
Very simple effect lighting, covers a huge area and is very affordable!                
Purchased to use with the 4Bar.  Works excellent together.  A must for the on-the-go DJ.                
the 4 play moon light is great except when i got it one of the light brackets were bent except for that it works great this summer i am going to use it for a gig and all the other things i bought here work great                
it has all the features that i expected for what i bought cant think of any more for this product i bought it open box but it works like the new thing                
its very easy to learn how to use this product easy to set up the manual is easy to read it has a few things that iam learning about it but this summer it will get the real test when i start gigging and it is expandable master to several slaves that i will be purchasing over time                 
yes the 4 play is made of steel and powder coated mine is in great condition except for a light bracket when i recieved it in the mail the bracket was bent except for that dependability i think it will last a long time as long as it is taken care of this is the only one i have at the moment but will get more later and as use on the road i say it is very road wervy  i cant find anything wrong with it and as for as long as it will last that goes how someone takes care of it if taken care could last for a long time                
i think the price could be alot lower cause the product is what i think should only cost 99 dollars the price is a little steap for the quality                
the service was great  and arrived on time with no exceptions iam a new customer only had it a few weeks so havent had to use any of the services yet                
it looks like what it is supposed to look like it is black in color                
i am satisfied with it and i plan to buy at least 3 more                
I did not research this product to well before i purchased it! even though it has a cool light effect,i did not know i could not use the lights individually,even i manage it and made them work,research your product before buying!be cause i did not know the dimension of the lights were so small,but they cast a big broad light spectrum for their size.I am talking about looks wise over all                
I received my 4 play from zzounds 4 days ago. Out of the box one of the pods didn't work. Called zz and asked to send me one for replace. Want credit card to hold the price until they get the old one back. Basically tying up 440.00 or my dollars to fix a problem I didn't cause. Chauvet was no help either. They didn't have the pod in stock and wouldn't send it anyway. Stuffs great when it works but don't expect service after the sale.                
Don't produce sound                
It is great tha this lights come with its own carring case.I use it on sound mode when i dj this light is always a winner.                
Simple and easy to set up.                
Looks like is well build.                
Great product for the price                
have not use the support yet                
The 4play looks very profesional and when you see them on they look awesome.                
have no intention on ever getting rid of them.Like them very much.                
Does Not Produce Sound                
Plug and play can be set and forgot if needed                
Very easy to use                
Looks to be made solid but the quality control is lacking, the unit I received had a ridge where the mount was welded that scratched my light stand, The case was not lined up so I had trouble sliding it over my light pole. The addresse were not set on the lights even though manuel said they would be.                
I would say it's worth the price.                
Have not contacted                
This thing throws alot of light but you really need 2 for anything over a small dance floor. There is a ridge in the mount that will scratch up your light stand (at least on the one I received) The light addresses were not set when I recived and the case was not lined up so it would not slide over my light stand. The case that comes with offers very little protection.That's the bad now the good the built in programs are great plus you can recall them via DMX it uses almost no power so it's great in some of those poorly wired halls we are always playing. It is very reponsive when use in audio mode. I will buy more of these                
These were the first lights I bought and i've got to say they are outstanding. Sound active mode with some fog really makes a nice light show. I normally used them on a speaker stand, but have recently started setting them in front of my facade and using them as up-lighting for my DJ setup. The payment plan for this is icing on the cake!                
What can I say. Everything I buy here is awesome. Bought it Sunday, had it Tuesday. Makes it easy for a local musician to have what they need for those under paid gigs. Thanks zzounds!                
Works well with the Chauvet 4Bar. A must for the on-the-go dj.                
I initially bought this to find out that this wasn't what I wanted but I have used it a few times for my Band rather than with my DJ rig & it has worked out very well.Not extremely bright but it is more than enough to light up the 3 man band I have.Pro:Kind of rugged & built very decently.LightweightVery quick set upCons:Not very bright.No static color displayPlastic spots could be better                
It's just a good basic light.move spots anywhere you like. Easy to use.                 
It's just a good basic light.move spots anywhere you like. Easy to use.                 
This is NOT a DMX bubble machine. There is no external interface. Just on and off. Nice unit if you don't need to control it. Otherwise, forget it.                
Not enough padding to protect lights unless you keep them in the box and throw them in here for carrying. I'll have to find something to wrap my USB Zoom in since I threw the box away.                
Chauvet makaes great lights, but this bag is total junk. The legs would not stay in place from the moment I opened the box! I had to put some set-screws into them to get them to stay. First night we used it on a gig the handle broke. Next night the zipper broke. There is no way to fix the zipper. It is now totally useless and I can't return it because I installed the screws. This bag is total junk. (But I love the Chauvet lights!)                
I like this bag a lot its well padded the material is a little stronger than the Arriba,( I own 2 of  Arriba AC-210 Bags) I purchased it to hold 2 ADJ ECO UV PLUS BARS and got more than I bargained for. It also comes with a shoulder strap that's comes in handy when carrying more than 2 bags, you just toss this one over your shoulder and keep it moving.                 
great product small size excellent features
The bag came straight out of the box with a broken zipper puller. Being that is usually the first to go and the hassle of getting it replaced. I decided to use it. In one week the other zipper puller broke and the zipper ceased to work. I was very disappointed that quality control sent a damaged product out to me to begin with. I have many Chauvet products. My 4 play stopped working last month. Starting to change my mind on Chauvet.                
No sound output, but the sound activation works well.                 
Its a light. Very bright, and looks way cool.                 
You will have to read the manual for DMX mode. If your a DJ plug it in, adjust the sound sensitivity and go. If you dont want to mess with DMX, I suggest buying the optional foot controller. Im going to for smaller gigs.                 
Well made, professional look and feel. Not cheesy in any way. Should last a while.                 
If you've been thinking of jumping into LED lighting, this is where to start. Great price to performance value.                  
I gave this a nine because I havent needed it yet, and I hope I dont.                 
I will buy more of these and the smaller "mini" version too                
I would buy again as Ive said, these fit right into my DMX setup perfectly.                 
Well, 1st off there's always something good to say about Chauvet but this time, I believe they outdid themselves with this product of the Mini LED Wash. I bought 4 of these right off the bat and they are amazing. So easy to daisy chain them electrically AND electronically! They're bright as all get out and do the job VERY nicely from a club to a wall accent, these babies will perform! Thanks Chauvet!                
These lights are a great addition to my stage set-up. They can be configured to highlight the dance floor, walls and ceilings. The many scene settings that are built into these lights, allow me to configure and daisy chain them without an external controller. All brackets needed for for truss or wall mounting are included. The solid construction, optional DMX controller ports, and complete instruction manual, makes these lights a perfect choice for any venue!!!                
I recently bought this to add to a dj setup....this light is very nice and has several different mounting options included with it......first used it at a last minute outside party that we had no time for big lighting...so i simply put this on the floor in front of the dj and it actually was all we needed!....I am going to add another.  On a side note...i haven't always been pleased with the quality of Chauvet lighting but this one is very well made....I'm now more open to buying other Chauvet lights.                
Affordable, yet reliable! Works great with DMX, and with sound activation. I've been using it as front lighting with my one man band show. plus on my rear truss when I DJ. Very easy to use and program!! I'm getting two more!!                
great product at a great price                
Seeing lights don't make sounds.  This product works off PA sound very well.                  
easily programable.  very versital.                
very good.                
Its a very good light, but it's just a light.                
haven't used it yet                
works great on my stage show.  Needs fog.                
This is a keeper.  I use it to make fan beams in the front of stage. There are other lights that could do the same. But at much higher cost.  I'm happy                
Use it with the 4 Bar Wash System. Love it!                
This was my first light I bought to start djing and I don't regret buying at all very awesome light good for small to medium venues leds make it very bright many patterns. I liked it so much I bought another.                 
the on board fog button.                
the manual dose not explain how to store the fog machine.                
i think the fog machines are great and made well.                
okay.                
the set up is great.                
until it stops running.                
I have purchased 5 of these packs and a few from zZounds.com. I have had problems with random fixtures going bad. The main boards have been going bad after a few months of having them. I have returned now my 3rd unit to zZounds.com and BIG THANK you to them for understanding Chauvet has a problem with these and taking them back. I use these maybe 3 times a month and the idea/fixture is perfect for my use but doesnt stand up well. I see having problems with these that will not go away base on the flaws built in. Hopefully Chauvet comes up with a better mother board/computer on these and replacing them in the future.                
Give the wow factor to your new light setup. easy wireless set-up.                
Love the flexibility you get with these stand alone lights!                
Love these stand alone additions to my show!                
I honestly thought the fogger was a decent buy.  With the premium juice the air stayed pretty fogged for a while.  I didn't have to run it constantly. When I did use it, it was fairly quick to fill the area. I actually had a lot of juice left over after the 5 hour event. It was a tad loud over the speakers.  Overall good buy.                 
Disappointed with the quantity of fog produced.  Even with an 11 amp heater it couldn't produce fog continuously.  At a low production setting, it would think it was out of fluid after a few seconds and lock out.  Had to be more than 25%.  I did like the ability to vary the rate and the adjustable nozzle was great for mounting it on a light bar.  All foggers seem to be noisy.  ZZounds is great.  I've ordered a number of items from them and have been very satisfied with their service.                
boughtt this to fill our shed with fog to make it super spooky for a halloween party. it worked awesomely. kept it goin all night for the dance party too. it worked flawlessly.                
has a pleasing, quiet whooooshing noise in use                
simple and practical                
tons of fog and the Chauvet fog juice is the best, hangs for hours and reduces to an excellent haze. minimal rainout                
havent had to use                
This fog machine is a nice addition.  convenient wired remote with about a 8 -10 foot cord for convenience.  I've used this for inside and outside shows, but its better for indoor use, not so much for outside, but what fog machine is.  This is definately worth the small price.                
I wanted to spice up my light shows for my mobile DJing so I decided to start out with the cheapest fog machine I could find. I was super impressed with the amount of fog this little guy puts out so I immediately bought a second one. Two of them will easily fill a smaller venue. Well worth it!                
I purchased two of these not being sure of the output.  I believe one will do well in most circumstances.  I mostly use it in small to large clubs.  The stages up to 24' x 16' (W x D) and these do well.  For the money, its a no brainer.  Yes there are good Hazers out there in the above $1000 range, but this does exactly what I was looking for at a fraction of the cost.  There is no overwhelming smoke, and lights beam well, even when you don't notice any haze in the room.  Its lightweight and easy to use.  The DMX function is great too.  I quickly set it up with my lighting software as it took me every bit of 5 minutes to get it up and running via DMX.  I like the fact I don't have to use "dip switches" to assign the DMX address.  Using it in stand alone mode gives good options too.  I am very happy with this purchase.  Very simple to use.                
These lights are amazingly bright and project an extremely crisp image with deeply saturated color! They are perfect if you need dynamite in a small package. We use these along with haze and a few LED pars and LED wash fixtures and they have no problem punching beautiful beams of light through our stage wash. They are also very easily and quickly able to be set to the correct DMX channel                
I use two sets of these with two GigBar 2 sets, and everything looks and works great! I use the DMX control function which works flawlessly.
Wish they came with a case!                
Got this light for small venues, it does the job very nicely, we are satisfied with its performance, the stobes are not  too bright and that's alright, we don't like a lot of flashing going on. the derby has a nice coverage area. you wont be disappointed if you decide to purchase this light.                
easy to operate great effect                
easy to use small package with great features                
Just got 6 of these. Way brighter than I expected. Tons of features. With a little patience you can do AMAZING things with these lights. I use them as two towers. Three lights high. They are great as crowd blinders, and def add a lot to my bands live shows!                
Excellent piece of equipment. Because of the tight, narrow beam we were able to use it in a church where (because of the architecture) a long throw was necessary to hit a relatively small target. It worked.                
This is a very cool item, creates a very nice effect for DJ's.  The quality is good. The documents/user guide is not very good, extremely vague on setting up features.  Comes in a nice carry bag.  Also comes with a few extra boards for the lights if something doesn't work but no info as to how to install it, you're pretty much on your own.  I have only used mine a few times in the sound activation mode and it's very cool.  If you are a solo or duo act, the constant changing can be distracting but a single color is very nice.  All in all, well worth the money.  The wire ties that come with it are not easy to work with.  They hold up the drape nicely on a 10 foot truss but they are "removeable, re-useable" and they don't come off very easily.  I suggest just using the regular ones and snipping them at gig's end.  Drape folds up and fits nicely in the bag.                  
Very satisfied with the product and the fast shipping
It added more of a show to my Dj gigs that I use it for and provides a great background for me.                
Great looking facade and drape combo that gives your show that extra WOW factor. However this is not for the mobile DJ at all. This unit is very fragile and you take the risk of damaging the lights each time you pack it up and move it. I've spent more time repairing lights that worked before I took it down to move to a venue, set it up to find out it's not working properly because of a damaged circuit board. I've even been extra careful in the moving/transport. To have this unit in a permanent location is ideal, not for mobile dj. Other than that, I love the product, very cool.                
n/a                
basic features that get the job done.                
pretty straight forward, even for those new to DMX.                
its plastic, but the buttons/faders seem fine.                
can't beat a DMX controller for around $50                
no problems                 
there are 2 versions, the regular one and the clear one. the clear one is pretty cool, cuz depending on what color you are set on, the actual controller itself will glow the same color. neat feature.                
i needed a simple, easy to use, basic dmx controller to control uplighting (such as the slimpar 56). works perfect.                
Solid construction.   Easy to use.  Inexpensive.   Does what it is supposed to do.                
This is a wonderful controller for a beginner, very simple. the thing to be weary of is the fact that it only has three channels. three channels are great for most slim pars and lighting strips, as long as they are only RGB. If you have a light such as the American DJ Mega Bar RGBA you will notice it wont work due to there being 4 channels. Other than that it is an amazing little controller.                
With only 3 channels, this unit is really not worth the money. Yes you can set multiple colors and such but if your looking for something that can utilize the effects of even the most simple of lighting its not worth the money. I bought it to use with the ADJ tribar spot setup and honestly, the little $19.00 remote has more functions in than this does.                
not bad if you use color washing lights only i have 2 fallout rbg lights and it dose not work well with them put a par can ya it works fine                
Sounds great for a light controller!  - Works pretty good too.                
I am still learning DMX and the Obey, seems to do everything I want it to do!                
I have needed some help, there really is no directions for DMX - I am stumbling through it - but with help have several programs that make it real easy to use                 
Appears pretty solid                
I think the cost / benefit ratio was very goode                 
I have had to call and email,  email takes a little bit for a reply, but the replies are very thorough.  I called also and the phone help was great -very patient with this novice, I was very impressed                 
It is a very nice board                 
THis looks like it will suit my needs for quite some time                 
After owning the obey 10, this was a breeze to setup.                
A bit of a learning curve but, once you get it its great! Only thing I miss is the option to Dim lights on the fly in scenes!                 
Overall Good product I use it to run two 4-Bars and the 6 Spot by Chauvet. I like the unit it does lack the ability to be able to fade a scene manually which is something that I would like it to have. Sometimes I don't want to use the chase to fade through my scenes. But overall a good product                
Very easy to use and set up. Awesome control.                
Has pedal board you have to cycle through for lighting effects so I bought a controller for more flexibility. Has very nice molded carrying case and a strudy speaker type stand with a carrying case. One unit will light a small stage with no problem and the LEDs are brighter than you might think. Overall this is a VERY handy lighting unit to own.                
You can't ask for any thing easier to use and set up. The only thing is don't try and get any help from Chauvet there support if you call it that is not at all won't call you back or answer your emails. If you do get to talk to some one they are don't know and will have to get back to you good luck with that.                 
This is my first DMX controller. I sat down with the manual for about an hour
And had all 12 lights on. My first show was amazing!! I received more compliments 
Then ever before. If you use smart lights you need this.                
The fixtures built in preset colors,custom static color mixing , digital control panel,low profile design with double yoke, and the power linking features.                
This fixture is very easy to program in standalone or with a DMX controller. Manual is is very user friendly.                 
This is a solid built feature the LED's are not exposed the plastic case that the feature is housed in is actually very durable.                
Well worth the price you pay for it.                
I have quiet a few Chauvet products just recently I needed and antenna for one of my wireless receivers gave them a call , Placed the order with them had the part in less than 5 days. They are a real light company located in the US (5200 NW 108th Ave. Sunrise, FL 33351) not some knock off company here today gone tomorrow.                
Light weight and very easy to use. More than capable of handling big events as well as small. Just a quick shout out to ZZounds, I went to them with a lower price from a competitor. Then not only matched it, they beat it! Great product, excellent service.                
I have purchased 12 of these par cans.  They are solid and great for up lighting.  I also use them to light my facade, as well as mount them on my speaker poles to flood the dance floor.  Easy to use and scroll thru the menu.  You can create or customize colors to your liking.  Small cons, not as bright as the ADJ Hex pars that I own as well.  Some or my slim pars don't do what the function says it should do.  I use them often for my mobile gigs such as weddings, quinceneras, etc.                
I'm new to lighting, but I have been running sound for over 30 years. I'm the stage manager in a coffee shop in Fresno CA with a small theater in the back. I needed something to light up the stage and our piano that sits off stage, the slimPAR 56 works perfectly. I have three on the stage and one on the piano. The washes are great and the effects are impressive. I am extremely satisfied with their performance.                
A second set of lights that I ordered, this lights are great and portable with the bag if you choose to purchase it. I use the lights for up-lighting primarily but they are great for wash lighting as well! Very Very Resourceful lights!!!                
I love these lights. They are a cost effective way to provide great up lighting. I recommend these.                
Easy to use, good casting for small to mid sized venues or as effect lighting for larger setups                
These lights are great! Light weight and portable. Gives the room a great affect. Love them.                
I bought 2 Chauvet SlimPar 56 Led, to use in a church as background wash. Just what I need. Great stuff.!                
Not a bad light for what would be considered the lowest powered for Chauvet in this category. Makes great up lighting for a party or event. Great light for the price, but if you want more lumens or color range move up to the slimpar64.                
Very bright.  Responds to the music well.                
Cerwin vega still rock!                
I did my research online of these lights before I bought them.  Once I bought them and connected them, that's all I needed.  Plug, set to Sound Mode, and you're done.  No more extra lights needed, No more time wasted connecting other lights.  I run these Master and Slave, and they are all I need for my Mobile DJ Gigs.  As for Weddings, not sure they're a good idea because of the laser lights messing up pictures as the laser beams appear on the faces.  But if you DMX these lights, you can control what lights you want on and off.  Adding a Hazer or Fog machine really enhance the visual effects.  I added one Swarm per speaker pole and both of these lights, light up the entire room with awesome effects.                
I've compared the SWARM 5 FX to the STINGER FX 2 and the STINGER out performed the SWARM 5 FX, now I gave compared the STINGER FX 2 to the SWARM WASH FX.This SWARM WASH FX is the new king in my book. Active, bright, built like a tank.Now I run this light with my 2 WASH FX lights and I can really get the Club hopping.The SWARM WASH FX is really the SWARM 6 FX.Great job from CHAUVET                
Love My Swarms Lights, Fills the Room, Easy to Mount. works great                
The Chauvet LED Shadow is an amazing product!! I spoke with a chauvet rep, and according to them each of the 192 LED's is only a 1/4 watt of power, so that's about 48Watts, the unit was able to be run off of a 90 Watt Inverter in my car off of the 12V Cigarette lighter adaptor. 
The dimming functions and the strobe rates are really clean and pack a hell of a punch. AMAZING JOB FROM CHAUVET!!                
Extremely easy to use, the dip switch settings on the back of the unit allow for you to set the strobe rates varying to about 9 different settings, the 10th setting allows for sound activated mode and has a few pre programed LED chase sequences. THe draw back to the chase sequences, it's only in the pre program, you cannot set it to automatically do the LED chases even in DMX mode. ( If there is, it's not listed in the manual and I haven't found it yet.                 
The plastic cover is alittle thin, and I also have witnessed where some of the LED's in the panel lose "blocks" but a slight tap on the fixture fixes that. Could just be a ground or something. 
For the price and functions, Chauvet Delivered using the TFXUVLED fixture! Where else can you find a UV LED strobe ?                 
Chauvets support is pretty good, but I sometimes feel I'm not getting the correct information. I've sent countless emails to see if I'd get the same info over the phone as I would over the internet with no response.                 
I liked the first one so much, I scouted 5 different locations and plenty of phone calls until I found one!                 
Hopefully a year or two at LEAST! I need about 2-4 more fixtures to really have some fun with them!                 
I was pinched for time, had a Blacklight Sweet 16 Party in 3 days, The guys at ZZZounds really helped out with pricing and shipping. Product is lightweight and 6 panels can light just about any large dancefloor or room, DMX effects look great too.                
The first unit that came had 3 of the LED's out, called customer service and it was replaced with no questions asked. The replacement is flawless and has a large beam. Very impressed with the blacklight wash that is cast from this light.                
It has several features. Ex. auto run, sync to music, and dmx controlled.                
Easy, I just pulled it out the box and pluged it up. I fixed the lights control on the fixture to run to my needs. Took 5 minutes                
Great quality! Hard metal shell. As long as you take care of it, it should last a long time.                
This is a great product. I would recommend to anyone i know to buy this product if they need it.                
I called to ask one question when i was trying to register the products i bought but they didnt understand my question and transferred me to an answering machine.                
These lights just look sexy when they hang.                
Lights up huge area and for the price its well worth it!                
I have used many products for DMX software from Free to paid, and this product is by far the best one I have used. I am sure there is something out there that I have not used and that is probably because it costs twice as much as this product and with the features Showxpress have I cannot justify having to pay those prices. zZounds was a champ matching the price i provided them and then went on top and beat it. If you buy this product you will not be disappointed.                 
Like the title says - after realizing that most lower-priced hardware DMX controllers simply weren't up to the lighting I had in my mind, I began looking at software solutions. After some test runs with various software, I settled on Chauvets ShowXpress software. The software is free... the compatible DMX box is decidedly NOT free. Pricey little bugger for the minimal amount of stuff inside it - but it's results that matter.
Absolutely trouble free install - ShowXpress saw it immediately with no bother. Laptop - USB - Xpress512 - DMX out to the bars, worked immediately and I was off and running. Nice thing with the software is it allows a 3D mockup of the stage layout and lighting - once I had defined the various lights in the "universe" I was able to pack away the 512 and lights and do my programming strictly on the lappy without the hardware attached.
I'm actually happier with this box than the scores might indicate - haven't needed manufacturer support, it makes no sound, and what kind of "wow" do you want from a little silver box?
Oh - currently running 2 Chauvet 4-Bars in the rear and 2 ADJ Tpars in front (go with the Tpars - way more bang for the buck) using around 70 or so DMX channels for full RGB control. This box will handle up to 512 channels, so tons of room for future expansion (looking at some moving heads currently).So - pricey considering what's inside, but no hassle operation out of the box. Does what it says on the tin with no mucking about - and that's good enough for me. If the ShowXpress software meets your needs - buy this interface.                
This is an upgrade for us from the ADJ MYDMX 1.0.  We loved the ease of setting up new scenes and easily controlled our 6 DMX lights.  Solid and great free software.                
Nice pick, does not glide off the strings fast. Instead these picks kinda grabs and sticks a little to the strings. Also there is no bevel like the red Jazz III's. But I still use them for the solid notes they make.                
I placed a large order and had tossed in a 3pk of picks, i opened the package up and 1 was broken. I went to grab another one and it broke in my hand, without even using it on the guitar. i reached for the final new one, on first strum, the pick broken in pieces. I threw all of them away and decided to take the loss. its not worth asking for a replacement based on the price, but i wouldnt recommend these.                
the sound produced by these picks are warm and solid.they have less mettallic tone,and a more woody tone.great for leads and single string  picking.good for jazz.                
indentation on one side for your thumb,grips well.                
kind of a thick pick,which i love.will not bend at all.                
the tip wears out kind of fast but still useable.                
worth the price for something different,they are hand made.                
n/a                
very warm tone                
good picks,i got the blonde wood picks so i could try something different.                
Fantastic pics love them you're wonderful pics they are very good in your head and the feet constantly music and songs very clear on the streams thank you S pics they are very good in your head and the feet constantly music and songs very clear on the streams thank you zZounds The wonderful pics                
these picks are great,i give them to other guitarists that i jam with as a sign of friendship.                
Very beautiful rich mid-rangey tone. A real pleasure on my dreadnought .                
I gave these a try to see if they really sound like fingers on a bass guitar. To me they sound pretty much like other picks, though they have their own sort of tone. I like the tone, they just don't sound like fingers to me, except when I let my fingernails grow a bit. My fingers then sound like picks. Don't get me wrong, these are nice picks, they're really stiff, good for bass guitar. The only bad thing is they smell terrible. Hopefully the smell will fade. If you keep them away from your nose, I guess they're all right. Then again, they're not THAT type of pick :-) 
I tried these with round wound strings, I'll soon try them with a bass with flats, they might be even better, flats always sound good with picks to me. I think they're worth a try.
The CL-1 took my existing pre-amps, added the levels I needed, and improved the sound. I'd say the price is worth that sort of performance!. Dynamics like an SM57 and SM7 are brought to life. Not to mention any passive ribbon mic! Do yourself a favor and grab one.                
I initially received a faulty unit. It was quicker to contact the manufacturer, so I emailed them. They called back fairly quickly and knew exactly the problem just from my description (a buzz in the signal). They sent me a new unit before I even sent back the old one (which they post-paid).The box does just what it says - adds clean gain for up to two channels. I've used on ribbon mics to get a nice boost on vocals and acoustic instruments. Also have used on dynamic mics to get a bit of headroom on the board. It is also very comforting to have your ribbons plugged in through the couldlifter and not have to worry about phantom power.Solid construction with no problems since the replacement.                
While there's not much to "review" about the Clouslifter CL-2, it works as expected, delivering clear gain and phantom power protection.  I purchased at "used" product and it looked like new...saved some bucks!                
I use this on my quite singers, and I love the boost that it gave them. I did not measure to see if it was 25 db of gain, but as I can tell it worked as promised. It was a nice clean boost in gain on my quite singers.                
I've had a lot of fun using this thing with all my dynamic and ribbon mice. You're rewarded with a wide variety of new sounds when the Z is introduced in to the recording chain. Boring SM57? Match this with it, adjust the impedance, and welcome to a brand new microphone. The hi-pass filter and clean boost are also extremely useful.                
It works for me . I read where someone said the seat does not rotate. Mine does. Not much padding, but I'm a light wait, 165 pounds. If your a big drummer this throne won't be comfortable. But overall I'm happy.                
N/A                
It is a cheap drum throne.  You adjust the stem for height, period.  The seat does not rotate, which I wish I had thought to check before I bought it. The seat itself is pretty small, I'd appreciate about 2 more inches in radius.                
Easy to set up and it works.                
So far so good.  No creaks or groaning under my weight (220 lbs). Double braced legs seem well built.                
It is a decent throne, but I wish I had spent a little extra money on one that has a better seat.                
N/A                
This is not the flashiest of thrones and looks as cheap as it costs.                
I am contemplating a return before my the return period runs out.  It is quite uncomfortable after an hour or so.                
I am not actually a drummer, I purchased the alesis dm6 usb electronic drums so that i could play my own drum parts without having to use vsts or drum machines. Quite naturally a good seat would be required, I am pleased with my choice...the cannon percussion up197 drum throne. It is a solid seat, the cushion is firm yet comfortable..I highly recommend this drum throne.                
The up197 drum throne is very sturdy and works like a more exspencive throne                 
The screws in the bottom of the seat became loose, and the plate underneath the cushion is cracked in several places. I weigh about 175 pounds, so this is not a matter of my dietary habits.                
This is still a pretty good buy. It lasted me a year. It's obnoxious to have to get another throne now, but I would consider getting another one of these.                
I picked this up about a year ago to go with my first drum kit. It seemed reasonably comfortable for the duration of its life. I would say I used it for an average of 5 hours a week, and it died in its 15th month yesterday.                
Hey thanks for the help in the purchase I recently made.  The drum throne and other accessories are perfect for my setup.  Thanks again                
Nice and sturdy.  Adjustable in 2 different ways.  But height adjustment involves removing and reattaching a bolt.  Granted, it is a wing nut so no tools are needed but what a pain if you share a throne with one of your kids like I do.  I will be buying a different throne soon to address that.                
It came fast and packed really well from ZZ, this is agreat throne for the money - bummer its not a swivel but after three hours it gets alittle loose -yet it doesnt break loose. about two hours on the throne your ready for a stretch.Hardware is durable and has a nice finish - If you know of a lightweight drummer who likes to work hard here ya go- and height is just right.                
Great product. Sturdy and reliable!                
very comfortable,sturdy,and just plain sweet for the price                
After just under one month of use, (an estimated 2-3 hours a day, give or take) this throne has rendered itself stuck. The bolt that holds it in place in terms of height has warped the metal through which it rests, thus negating any ability for height adjustment that this throne is intended to have. The cushion itself (which shows no signs of wear) is relatively comfortable for up to and slightly beyond two hours of use, but for a 6'5" 185lb musician just finding his way into the world of percussion, this is incredibly disappointing. You get what you pay for. No effort has been made to reach out to the manufacturer given that this is obviously not a defect, simply the quality of materials.                
Two hours max on this seat. Spend the money and get a more comfortable seat. It is sturdy and i'm sure it will last a long time, but so would a rock.                
Delivery was cheap and fast ... mainly because I live in the same state as the warehouse.   I researched and decided I wanted the Pearl Traveler's Drum Kit because it was complete with excellent hardware ... I totally agree.  I changed the high hat cymbals for better tone and put a pillow in the kick drum.  I think the head with the kit are just fine.  It went together fine.  Sounds great ... I don't want to work, I just want to bang on the drums all day!                
I purchased 2 of them, as I wanted to create an easy, set up for me, and my husband to nestle in together to play together, they are great, quality hardwear, easy fold down, set up, and light enough, and compact enough to carry on the beach. The seats, are a little cheap feealing, like the fabric isn't gonna last long, but the hardware quality is so good that, it will be easy, and maybe fun to recover when they wear. Definitely would buy or recommended again. Thanks ZZ                
This is a truly unique guitar. From the beautiful Solid Indian Rosewood top, the warm colorful tone, and the Fusion style neck and radiused fingerboard. I have the 12 fret model with a cutaway. it’s a breeze to play. The Rose sounds like no other guitar I own. In a good way though. It resonates and sustains to the horizon. Wow! The Fishman electronics work as they should. The internal microphone is a nice addition. I am very happy with this buy.  Cant comment on manufacturer support.                
This is a really nice guitar.  I like it better than my Taylor.  I play for the church and it has a very rich beautiful tone.  It is easy to play chords and sounds beautiful fingerpicking.  Not to mention the color and size is really nice too  My favorite of all.  I get lot's of compliments on this guitar                
Overall it's a decent ukulele for the price you pay. The sound is rich and loud. Each detail and feature is aesthetically made.                  
I wanted to buy my son and entry level UKE for Christmas but instead I bought a really nice one in this instrument.  I am sure by price tags their must be better on the market but as far as I am concerned for $99 I am not sure why you would want one.  After a year I actually think I ended up buying me a UKE since I play it daily.                
You really can’t go wrong with this beautiful instrument. It looks great, and the sound is bright with incredibly warm undertones. If you are looking for a ukulele that is well built, with a tender yet voluminous sound you will find it here. This is a ukulele you won’t be able to put down - you will want to cradle it in your arms daily, almost hourly. This is my second (I gave one away to a little girl I taught how to play) , but I couldn’t stand to be without it, so I bought another one which I will never depart with. This is a uke for artists and lovers. I can’t recommend it enough.                
after hitting lot with a couple of bad GK Studios late last year,  which both zZounds and Cordoba bent over backwards to correct, when i finally got my hands on the guitar i remember thinking, "man i wonder what this would sound like in solid wood?"  well, the GK Studio has been amazing.  it has opened up so much over just the past 8 months and i finally nailed the sound i wanted when i tried the Cordoba high tension strings.  i am completely satisfied with its sound and action.  with the new polyfoam case that came with my c10 i feel like i have my "electric" guitar nailed.  however, i never got to scratch that "solid wood" itch, until now...
so to reward myself on the occasion of my 58th birthday i crossed my fingers, threw some salt over my shoulder and ordered my "dream guitar" site unseen again, your requisite cedar topped, rosewood back and side, ebony fingerboard, mahogany neck, bone nut and saddle, gold hardware classical guitar and hoped for the best.  and boy i wasn't disappointed!
the Cordoba C10 is incredible, beyond even my strict expectations.  the craftsmanship is impeccable.  i honestly can't find a single flaw in the entire instrument.  the wood on the soundboard is tightly grained and even.  the finish is applied evenly throughout.  the mahogany in the neck seems to be a higher grade than in my GK Studio.  the ebony fingerboard is beautifully dark and straight.  the gold hardware is smooth and accurate.  granted the guitar is simply stated, but elegant as is the mother of pearl rosette.  
amazingly enough, the action is almost there for me, right out of the box.  i will invest in a professional setup just to extract all the tone and action that i can from this beauty. 
the guitar sounds incredible!  the estudios i practice everyday sounded like new pieces, every note clear and musical.  the intonation is right on, up and down the neck.  the bass and treble are wonderfully balanced and full.   even the volume projects surprisingly well.  and to top it off i got the "new" headstock design (or the old one, i don't know, but it's the one i really wanted).  i knew that i'd landed myself a winner!
i honestly couldn't put it down yesterday after it arrived and i really needed/wanted to get it into the Humicase and let it settle in to the summer climate here and humidify. 
the only thing i will change about the guitar is the strings.  i'm anxious to hear how it'll sound with the Cordoba high tensions.  
i'm not going to promise that anyone else will get as lucky as i got, but if i wanted a good classical i'd be eying that other Cordoba C10 and hope it's from the same lot.                  
Every fret had a sharp burr on both sides. Other than that the guitar is beautiful. Has a deep high gloss finish with a flat black fret board. Nice but unplayable out of the box.                
I have played guitar for 45 years. This is a very nice guitar. Note though that zZounds lists the nut width at 2" and is really 2.04 which for those of us with smaller hands is a big difference. They got the mm correct, but I am not so metric. The fit and finish on this guitar are first rate and it is as nice as some much more expensive guitars I have played. The tone on the cedar top is dark and quite Spanish sounding. Very nice for classical or Bossa playing. I suspect the sauce is brighter as it usually is but I haven't gotten to try one. I like it very much but the neck width may be a deal breaker for me. But I sure like the tone. I give the 1 star in manufacturer support as I wrote to them via the website and got no response.

This is a great guitar for the money.  I have had the opportunity to play on some rather expensive custom luthier made guitars.  The guitar has a nice sound.  It has a brighter sound than a traditional cedar top guitar.  
I previously owned a Cordoba F7 and I loved it. For whatever reason, I decided to sell it and I regretted that decision ever since. I finally decided to get another classical guitar and tried several in the $2k range. By far, the C12 blew all of the others away. I have small hands and this guitar is incredibly easy to play compared to several other guitars I tried. It also sounds amazing -- the bass is excellent and the higher notes sound amazing, too.
While it's made in China, I'm also very impressed by the craftsmanship. It was setup perfectly out of the box and I can't find any issues with it at all. I'm definitely happy with my purchase!                
From the moment I opened pulled the case out of the box, I had goosebumps. I was currently playing a Cordoba C5 that I was in love with. It got me through many of my classes and concerts, but it was just time to upgrade. Upon opening the case and taking out this beautiful instrument, I had to simply stare at it for the first few minutes before even playing it. Once I sat down and strummed the first chord, I knew that I had a keeper. The warmth and overall tone was something that can only be experienced in person. I took a gamble not playing one before purchasing it, but I had read enough reviews to trust my gut and I have no regrets at all. I play a wide array of classical music and some modern pieces; across the board the C12 can do it all. If you're trying to get an amazing guitar and not go bankrupt, this is THE guitar you want. I don't see myself buying another one for many many MANY years to come.                 
Clarity, resonance, playability , I can"t put it down !  This is my dream guitar !  I took a chance on a blemished instrument, and I cannot find a flaw.                 
Noses up about Cordoba classical guitars being made in China. Well I guess you don't know your history. For centuries the Chinese wood carving artisans have been revered throughout the world for their intricate works of wooden art. It's no wonder that the very savvy CEO of Cordoba Guitars chose these devoted, knowledgeable artisans to produce such beautiful instruments to reach our hands and our musical hearts.                  
Very nice guitar for the price. The sound is warm and Kenny Hill knows what he is doing when it comes to setting up shop for a mid range concert instrument.                
Simply said; this magnificent guitar should be upgraded to Cordoba's master series. The C 12 sound has such a beautiful voice, not to mention it,s high "decibel" volume. Why try to explain it? You have to play this fine guitar to believe it. I've been playing classical guitar for close to twenty years, and with that said, I honestly feel that the Cordoba C 12 would easily be just as comfortable on the concert stage.                  
Recently purchased the Córdoba C12 SP from Zzounds. It arrived quickly as usual with the service at Zzounds. However the guitar guitar was far from new, it looked more like a battered demo than a new guitar. Scratches abounded on the back and there seemed to be someone's lunch remnants on the face. The strings were heavily played by the looks of rings around them. The guitar sounded very nice but comparing it to a C3M there seems to be a huge disparity in price versus what the tangible difference appears to be. Zzounds offered about $200 off to keep the guitar however I sent it back and they graciously received it. Buying online has its pros and cons but Zzounds helps buffer them out with their customer friendly policies.                
Around 10 years ago I bought a guitar-shaped object that was part of a package. It has never kept in tune for long  and my interest in playing it was low. Now with this beauty sitting beside me I am twitterpated and can't wait to finally learn to  play the guitar. 
zZounds.com was so easy to order from and the shipping was quick considering this is the Christmas season.                 
Great guitar, it has a rich sound and excellent tone. The quality of the craftsmanship is awesome. The looks reflects its traditional heritage. Once tuned to pitch, it stays that way very well .
Sturdy yet lightweight, fast and easy to play. Go for it!!!                
All solid wood no laminates.  You will be hard pressed to find a better sounding classical guitar in this price range and higher even.  The Cedar top makes for a warm deep sound.  Mine needed some fret dressing on the ends.  For the price no problem.  Bone nut and saddle.  The gig bag is excellent.  I have gone through countless guitars of all kinds.  This is one of the best buys out there.
To Note: Cedar will ding and scratch just looking at it.  Make your own pickguard out of some clear vinyl you can find at Wal Store in the material department.  Cheap.  It clings to the gloss finish.                  
Was really impressed by the online and phone service I received. I had ordered the C5 and a gator classical guitar case, separate, while inquiring about the discount price and how that would apply to both together, even though but both would be sent separate. "how nice it would be if both were sent together, I was told that probably was not going to happen, because both were not in the same proximity. I received the order in about 5 days, WY is a hard place to get an order of this size  in this amount of time. I received "one" package, the guitar was sent in the gator guitar case, which was excellent, goes to show my individual situation was taken into account. The guitar is of superior make, the C5, beautiful wood and sounds rich and vibrant, I do plan to buy the same again. I have always felt in order to get a good guitar you must be able to sample them, I have not been able to find a guitar in WY or surrounding states that are not a toy quality. I am not disappointed in following these online reviews, invaluable.                
The Cordoba C5 is a Great buy for a classical Guitar. A few years ago I tried a C5 , C7 and C9 and I thought the C7 and C9 were Fantastic and was not impressed with the C5. So I had the C7 on my radar but never got around to buying one (I mostly play acoustic and electric guitars), but recently I decided to take the plunge and finally get a Classical and went to test them out. I was very surprised when testing the C5 it had the C7,C9 feel and sound , huge improvement over my previous experience. I also tested others brands and none came close to the Cordoba's in the same price point. After doing more research, the main difference between the C5 and the C7 aside from some cosmetic upgrades is that the C5 has Mahogany Back & Sides and the C7 has Rosewood. This usually means that the C7 will have more Hi/Lo sounds accented and have a little more volume, the C5 will have more Mid's accented and have a warmer mellower sound, Honestly I can barely tell the difference and other than then that its virtually I identical to the C7. When I received the C5 it was in perfect condition and came in the Gator GLCLASSIC Lightweight Classical Guitar Case I had ordered with it after playing the C5 for a month I can say I made the right decision, I am so happy with my purchase and quality of the guitar it sounds great and plays great. The finish on the guitar is perfect it really make the details in the wood look awesome and the Case fits perfect and protects the guitar very well. Thanks zZ                
I waited awhile to do this review so that I had time to play with my new axe for awhile!  Boy, oh boy what a guitar.  I had fully expected for this to be a 300.00 guitar but was I wrong!  This is a beautiful instrument, bar none!  
The tonal quality is what one would expect with an instrument costing hundreds, if not thousands more.  I watched Tavi Jinariu play this guitar on youtube and it was fabulous!  Perfectly sized with one minor, and it is very minor and did not reflect on my ratings, is that the neck is just a fraction too small for my big palmed, shorter finger hands.  But, I found that if I rotate it slightly outward, it sounds so much better (no buzz).  I would recommend this for any beginner and professional!                
This guitar has an encreditable voice. It tone is warm and distinctive.The volume projects well in a closed room and is a full and even tone throught. I havent had to mike it but I just know thatb it will soar.                
The gig bag is a treat and is well padded. I wouldnt hesitate to carry my guitar to an outing in it. The bag is strong and attractive and I think offers some protection from bummping and bruising.                
This guitar melts in youre hands. I skim up and down the fretboard with such ease that I surprised my own self. I can bearly put this beautiful peice of art away.                
This is a very well made classical guitar. For under $1000.00 The quality and finish of this instrument is unique. I love the looks and style of this guitar. I mainly use this guitar for training and practice as I am a beginner in the music world but I think that this guitar travel well and in the proper venue it would be a pleasure to hear played.                
This is a great guitar and not only preforms like a high end guitar but its looks and feature are equal as well.                
This guitar stands tall in the looks department and is a work of art. The finish and wood tone is splended and nicely highlighted at the curves and back. The headstock is bueatifly stained and well carved,the word that comes to mind is elligant.                
I will most likely keep this guitar as a main stay and as it wears or fails I will keep getting things repaired and beefed up. The saddle and nut are plastic but for the money and quality this is quit a bargain. I will eventualy replace the nut and saddle with bone after they wear out. You cant ask for a better guitar for this cost.                
As a classical guitar student looking for a step up from my original "starter" guitar, I was particularly anxious to find a guitar with not only better sound, but also with high quality workmanship made by a company fully dedicated to producing superior quality instruments.  The Cordoba C5 was perfect for my budget, and my research into Cordoba convinced me that this company is seriously into this business for the long haul, and that the C5 would be an excellent choice for me at this stage - and that they have a full range of guitars to meet my future needs as well.  Now that I've experienced the C5 for a month I'm absolutely delighted with it.                
The Córdoba C5 acoustic guitar is a good instrument to start learning to play guitar. It has great sound and clean sounds. The only problem I had with my guitar was on the E string. It had a buzzing after sound after the first week. It wasn't hard to fix, all I used was a small peice of paper underneath the string holder (by the neck of the guitar). Other than that I am glad I got the right guitar.                 
Solid Top Classical with no issues for this price is unbelievable. Purchased this guitar for my wife because she just couldn't play a steel string acoustic without hurting her fingers. She Loves this guitar and I find myself picking it up quite often over my other steel string acoustics. Great Big Tone and wonderful feel. The strings that it comes with are Premium Avarez Strings! Beautiful Guitar!!                
If you're thinking about learning the classical style of guitar playing this is the instrument to choose. Very playable and sounds great. With a solid cedar top for under $300 is a steal. I agonized over a more expensive model(C10) but realized I just needed a decent guitar to learn on and this instrument goes way beyond that. Looks and sounds like a more expensive classical guitar, so just go for it you will be pleased!                
This guitar is wonderful!! I am a newbie, but even my teacher was impressed with the quality and sound - especially as I chose a "B-stock" to save some money. I was very impressed with the price, quality, speed, etc.   Would definitely recommend zzzsounds and this guitar to anyone!!                
I bought this guitar 5 years ago to have something a little easier on the fingers with which to take lessons. The top is solid cedar, the back and sides are no doubt laminates. Overall it’s an easy-to-play student guitar, once you address one, critical issue.The frets aren’t finished or dressed properly at the edges. They are VERY sharp, and must be smoothed a bit unless you wish to add some profane vocals to your playing. As a student guitar, the action is pretty high, at least mine was. As I became more proficient, it was an easy task to reduce the height of the saddle a bit. If you do so, be careful as the saddle already sits low in the bridge. If overdone, the strings will contact the bridge, and you’ll need to shim the saddle until you can replace it. The C5’s voice has mellowed with age and use. It came with Savarez strings, but after trying a lot of brands, it’s worn D’Addario Pro Arte Hard Tensions for a few years now.Although I have others, this is my “go-to” guitar when I want to relax a bit and play. It’s a good investment, but it will require a little attention before it becomes comfortable.
I haven’t had reason to contact Cordoba about any issues, but a “Manufacturer Support” rating is required.                
I couldn't believe this nice and beautifully-made guitar was available for even$300, let alone $200! The mahogany body is very attractive, the neck/fingerboard width is great, the tone is wonderful, and it's also very light. I plan to do some recording with it very soon so I will fin d out more about THAT particular aspect of it!                
Awesome guitar. action is perfect right out the box. I would recommend this guitar to all my friends.                
I purchased this guitar and have no regrets! It plays great. Very deep loud sound. Lightweight and easy to transport. Great for the price. Would reccomend.                
We where impressed when taking it out of the box and this was reinforced when we heard it played the first time. Great looking and great sound. There was a small blemish on the top (factory finish) but not enough to return it. Other than that imperfection, we are delighted with our purchase. Best value for a guitar in this price range.                
The overall build quality was good with one glaring exception. The frets were not dressed at all. This was hands down the most painful guitar I've ever tried to play. The tone seemed good, but the guitar as it arrived was unplayable. This is not a reflection on zZounds, but on Cordoba's quality control. Even for an inexpensive guitar, this is not an area to economize on. So if you order one, you may be lucky and get a more finished guitar, and if so, you should be satisfied, but I was disappointed.                
I researched this for a couple of weeks, and have played guitar for over 30 years so I've owned some good ones in the past. 
All these reviews about this c5 being the bees knees   are astonishing. Maybe I received a different c5. Now this guitar is just fine played ok and sounds ok but there is very little that is special, in fact I should have bought the c3 and saved $100 but I'll live. 
Actually I really should have waited and bought a used Yamaha for $50 but again this has a trus rod and warranty so I suppose its a good buy. 
In the end it's a $300 guitar, don't be fooled into thinking it's anything else.                 
The sound is not really good, I always have to tune it right everytime I use it.                
Sound...beginner quality                
Fits the beginner bill for weight and size.                
Same                
Well made. Beautiful to look at.                
At half price ok, full pop...nugatory ghost rider.                
NA                
Sound quality kills the wow factor                
Had I paid full pop for this item it would have gone back. Wonder if YAMAHA wouldn't have been better. Its ok for a beginner which my wife is but I have a Martin so I am not impressed. It is beautiful to look at and is light and easy to hold for her.                
I ordered this guitar on a Wednesday night around 11 pm with standard free shipping and it showed up at my doorstep saturday. I was so excited to see it, upon opening it it was exactly how i pictured it. It is such a beautiful guitar for the price. I loved the fact that the guitar had a bone nut and saddle. It makes the playability so much better and its a great addition to the guitar for the price. I also really love the Fishman pre amp with the built in tuner. Really makes tuning it up quick, easy, and accurate. Overall its a great guitar with no problems. Plays great and sounds even better. Cordoba guitars are great and id recommend them to anyone.                
Wanted a transition guitar to play some blues and jazz with my friends.  Guitar sounds great either lugged in or unplugged.
Value for the price is exceptional.  Great instrument for the price.                
This classical guitar has great sound, easy to play, all frets work and a buyer can choose from three different colors. It  has a built in Fisherman EQ, tuner and a trust rod to accommodate the neck to your most preferable play-ability.                
I bought the same Cordoba C5-CE guitar after I returned the one I bought from you and which I paid $63,00 to Fedex to ship it back.  The Cordoba C5CE  that I recently purchased at  Allegro Music Store in Fremont , California has a great sound.  The store owner explained to me that the trouble might be on the way you store this products. He said that it was not stored in an ideal location and weather condition hence the buzzing sound.  The one that I bought from you does not have a solid sound on the 2nd and 3rd strings.  Overall, it sounded like a cheapy guitar and not worthy of the Cordoba brand.                  
The components and materials that were used to produce it were good and overall appearance is great                
I was not able to get a good sound from it although it was very playable.                
It was well built but the sound was not solid.                
The selling price is reasonable but with the sound that I got , it seemed like a rip-off.                
I have not personally talked to a Cordoba company representative except the ZZounds people.                
I liked the gig bag.                
Can't tell. I am doing good with my present one though.                
sound is a little thin unamped but is awesome with the pickup and thru a PA system.                
Love the tuner and the Fishman is also great.                
Wish the action was a tad lower but not that big of an issue it is very playable.                
I thought the fit and finish was outstanding. Don't know about how reliable it is but appears to be solid.                
Very well priced. I was suprised it was such a quality intrument at this price.                
Haven't had to deal with them.                
Very nisce sex appeal very Spanish Classical looking.                
Probably won't replace it any time soon.                
The sound is a little thin acousticaly but is excellent when pluged in to either a little Fender amp or the Yamaha efx 212 Pa system.                
The tuner is the best part about this product.                
The only thing that didn't warrant a 10 is the tuners on it. Other than that the fit and finish is excellent.                
Haven't played any thing else to compare it to but it is I feel worth the price that I paid.                
Haven't had to                
Very good appeal the smaller neck feels better than a standard classical neck.                
I expect to have this for at least 5 yrs before upgrading. When I do I will look for every thing this guitar has the preamp and tuner.                
I've had three of these.  All three after a year or so the bridges pulled off.... bang. open the case to a mess of strings and the bridge ripped off the guitar.  Sending back the third guitar and HOPING for one that doesn't fail.  What a PITA.  I've owned a lot of guitars, some of them for over 40 years and have NEVER had a bridge that just pulled off.  Really tired of paying for shipping to get a new guitar under warranty.  Keep hoping the next one will will be better but so far just have been disappointed.  Really regret buying a Cordoba..                  
I purchased this guitar new with a natural finish from zZounds.com online and within a 7 day week I had received my guitar very promptly. 
I started playing guitar in 1995, mainly I play electric so this guitar is nice to play because of the thin neck however, it is wide like a traditional classical. I record a lot and wanted a classical sound of a Spanish acoustic guitar.
The guitar was in great condition when it arrived however, I went to play the guitar using the on-board tuner and noticed it wasn't working because the pickup system wasn't fully plugged in inside the guitar! I didn't want to send it back and I have enough knowledge to figured it out myself.
Luckily my wife and I were able to plug the cable back inside the guitar and everything worked perfectly.
The guitar acoustically and electrically sounds really good! The thin body is comfortable for long periods of time and it still has a full bodied sound despite it's compact size. It feels like a very good quality guitar in the hands. The weight of the guitar is evenly balanced from neck to body.
I have played a similar Ibanez model which plays like an electric because of a smaller size neck/fretboard and nut width, and was considering that because it's cheaper however, the Cordoba sounds superior especially when unplugged. It has a nice defined mid range, sweet highs possess sounds that are inviting beyond the 12th fret, no fret buzz, and defined lows.The Fishman electronics sound dynamite! When I recorded this guitar it sounded best when not eq'ued besides a little bass and treble boost from on-board pre amp on the guitar.
The battery door is a little bit tough to open unless you have a strong thumb nail. 
It could use a 3 or 4 band eq control instead of a 2 band however, they did that because this guitar does NOT need EQ'ing to sound good. Just PLUG AND PLAY! The tuner is easy to use and very clear. Comes with a phase switch.
Overall no big complaints. I guess the only thing I could say is the price is average, always could be cheaper in price. haha :) Treat yourself to something nicer than the Ibanez or Tyler Mountain (cheaper guitars).
I recommend anyone to buy this guitar for any type of player beginner or advanced. 
Great sound, look, and it makes me want to play when I see it on the stand.                
I'm a professional guitar and bass player for more than 25 years and I can tell you that this guitar in particular is a really good deal. The sound is clear and  the small body it's amazingly loud. The tension was right outside the box and really easy to play.  I've been trying so many different brands for years and Cordoba is really consistent with their products. I got the black one, it's a keeper for me!.                
I received my item new. The pickup system was unplugged inside the guitar so I plugged it back inside the guitar, and it worked great.
The tuner works well, very easy to use. 
Acoustically it is great! Nice low frequency resonance despite the very comfortable thin body design, projection is medium loud, sweet highs and upper range is great.
I've had the guitar a month, it has no fret buzz whatsoever knock on wood it stays tgat way. It's best to control humidity levels using an AC or dehumidifier for us South Floridians.
The neck is wide like a traditional classical however it is very thin so it plays great for hours without fatigue.                
This guitar is great in all aspects.  Straight out of the box, the guitar had perfect intonation. The sound is full and well balance which was a concern for me because I have tried other thin line classical guitar that sound weak. This guitar is perfect for any style especially classical guitar.                
This little guitar is a great purchase for casual play. For a small thin body it sounds quite nice and meets my needs for an "extra" guitar to keep by the bed or couch. I don't usually play a classical, but I wanted a quiet instrument to fool around with others might disturb others. The thing looks great with it's gloss black finish, is light, and comfortable to hold, and gives good tone. First and only Córdoba. I am pleased.                
The sound is very warm, yet yields very nice highs. Very sweet sound. The sound of this guitar with or without amplification is very sweet. The onboard BBand is very nice. You won't be disappointed.                 
I wanted to let you know that I received my C5-CET a few days ago from Zzsounds.com. I’ve had some time to draw an opinion about this new addition to my collection, and I’m very impressed with Cordoba. She sounds, looks, and plays as good as any $2,000.00 plus guitar. Workmanship is very good. I examined it inside and out. Bindings are flawless, and inside bracing is nothing less than high quality craftsmanship. I compared the craftsmanship and playability against two high end guitar, both are U.S. made, and honestly, the C5-CET stands right up there with them in the categories I stated.                 
Plays very smooth. I like the thin neck.                
As I explained earlier, this is a very well made guitar.                
You cannot beat the price on this guitar. There are other builders that would price this guitar a lot higher. This is a well made guitar.                
I had a question concerning the truss rod before I received the guitar. The are very responsive and fast to get back to you. Their website is awesome.                
I don't know about "sex appeal", but the thin-body is very sleek and is made to play standing up. To me the thin-body provides an ease of play.                
I don't expect I'll be trading this guitar. I would replace it if I were to lose it, as it really fit me and my playing style.                
Compared to a Manuel Rodriguez classical guitar that cost me substantially more two years ago from another retailer, my very recent purchase of the less expensive Cordoba C7 leaves me slack-jawed; I can tell you that not only do I find the tonal quality superior, I also like the slightly lower profile neck which is a perfect fit for my medium-size hand.  For many more reasons including those above, I find myself more and more drawn to play - and now practice - just so that I can experience this guitar more often; this is a good thing as being a non-professional it allows me to dream a little as I build on my abilities daily rather than occasionally.
There's no question.  Cordoba offers a beautiful, superbly handcrafted guitar.  As well, if you purchase it from an authorized dealer and register your purchase at the Cordoba site in their own words they say, "When you purchase the HumiCase™ within 7 days as your Córdoba guitar, we (Cordoba) will upgrade your Limited Three Year Warranty to a Limited Lifetime Warranty."
Comparison really is important when buying any guitar, so just try and make sure that you have a good standard from which to make your final decision for both quality and price.  However you may choose, Cordoba offers a good basis from which to compare.  And, after seeing what this site has to offer in great pricing, there's no question that my purchase of an upgraded model of a Cordoba will be made here.                
In the pictures, it looks great, but when you get it... man! 
Not to mention, it plays like a dream. I got the guitar just yesterday and I have played it for a few hours already. Sounds great, very mellow as other people have said. 
To sum up my thoughts- The guitar is beautiful in sound and appearance, the case is excellent, the value and wow factor are incredible for this price point, and it is just plain fun to play.
Great product and zZounds is always great! Would buy again if I lost it                
This guitar has a vary warm tone due to the cedar top and rosewood fingerboard. It has great basses, not as great trebles (obviously not spruce). Sound is very mellow, you can drive the guitar when you want. You can also play it softly and it responds well. I play classical exclusively and it fits my needs perfectly. It definately compares to the La Patrie (500 dollar model), Kremona Sofia and Fiesta, and the New World Series 45c (Kenny Hill).  I don't record with it, but I plan to.                
Solid top and the bone nut and saddle are great. The neck is a little larger, and more squared off. The guitar isn't overbuilt, it's really light. The only downside is obviously the neck shape and the laminated back and sides, which is still great. Very georgious guitar.                
Everythings great.                 
Of course it's not a lutheir built instrument, but it's one of the best instruments you can buy for the money. I've tried several Yamaha's that were overbuilt. The Yamaha 201s for example doesn't even compare to the sound on this bad boy. I've heard that Cordoba has had problems with the bridge falling off, I've only owned this guitar for a little while so I'm still waiting to see if any problems arise.                
Definately.                 
I havn't had to use their customer support yet.                
Probably the best thing about the guitar is the colors. The indian rosewood back and sides and I actually had black tuning heads... just beautiful...                
This guitar is one of the best if not the best sounding guitar for the money. I have played it for some time and it sounds beautiful. The sound is very full and crisp yet mellow, but you can drive the guitar if you feel the need. I would definitely recommend.                
I received my C7 about a week ago and have now had time to really gaze and play and appreciate this beauty!  It is a gorgeous instrument.  The fit and finish is incredible.  Even the inside of the body is beautiful!  The sound is loud and full and can cut through.
I am a student learning classical guitar and this guitar is going to keep me happy for many years I think.
Here's the main thing...  I took this guitar to my instructor and he started playing it.  A look of confusion came to his face...   "How much did you pay for this?"  359 (it was a "blemished" stock).  He plays some more...  "Man, I couldn't find this sound when I was looking for guitars until I crossed the 1000 level".  Then after 15 minutes, he gives it back and picks up his guitar.  He starts to play and says, "My guitar doesn't sound as good anymore."
True Story.
I got a great deal at zZounds because it was "blemished".  I still have no idea what the previous customer found wrong with it...  I can only guess they didn't understand the strings need a while to stretch and stay in tune and so they returned it.  I can find no mark, no issues - a truly remarkable value - and it comes with a fantastic gig bag.
I also own a Cordoba 25TM-CE Ukulele and I have experienced same high quality in that instrument.                
This guitar is excellent! Hands down the best sounding classical in it's price range. When I was "test driving" classicals, looking for something that had depth, clarity and projection, I kept coming back to this C7. It is by far the most well crafted as far as sound that tried out. I really found only very subtle differences between it and guitars priced much higher.                 
For this to have the "made in china" slicker slapped on the back of the headstock, it really is very well crafted and shows an excellent attention to detail. The tuning keys are ornate and work excellently, the finish on mine is superb and doesnt have any flaws or imperfections. I purchased the Canadian cedar top because the sound is deep and warm, but projects excellent treble tones as well.                 
Came ready to play after the strings settled in slightly. No having to horse around to get rid of annoying buzzes or hums. Is built just like classical guitars that are twice the price.                 
Everything came perfectly clean, finished, and ready to play. I am glad I ordered it from zZounds because the ones I was trying at my local GC's were getting the typical store display abuse. For what you pay for this guitar, you are getting more than your money's worth. It seems as if Cordoba understands how to build a quality product at a reasonable price.                 
Best value for your money. This guitar will make you want to never put it down, and you won't be stressing on the price either!                
Everytime I get it out of the case, I get excited to play.                 
I plan to play this guitar until I wear a hole through the wood or my fingers fall off, whichever comes first.                 
I love the sound,  the feel and mine came with the action perfect. I should have got one a long time ago.                 
The sound is good. I wouldn't put it in it's own category but definitely on par with other guitars in the same price range.                
The most useful feature is the truss rod. This is very uncommon in traditional classic nylon string guitars and will prove very useful.                
The main key to getting great sounds from any instrument is the player. However, I would recommend changing the stock strings to some EJ45 Pro-Arte's from D'addario. They have a warmer tone.                
As long as you keep it in the supplied gig bag and make sure to check the humidity often, I see no reason why this guitar wouldn't last decades.                
Absolutely worth the price. For $500, you'd be hard pressed to find another nylon string that has the same level of craftsmanship. Some may argue that you can't get a good nylon string for under $1000 but for those of us on a budget, you can't go wrong with this.                
Fortunately, I haven't had any reason to contact Cordoba.                
The price, the truss rod, the finish, $500 = Wow.                
I must say this is a fantastic guitar for the price. I felt as if I was playing a $800+ instrument. The quality is really on par with other popular brands that also sell nylon string guitars in the same price range. The finish is beautiful, a nice reddish/natural color. I read some complaints about the guitar being a bit too heavy but I disagree. It couldn't be any more light in my hands and fits perfectly in my lap. The neck is smooth and fast, fret edges are trimmed and tuning pegs feel like they have a good weight to them. A top quality guitar for under $500. Thanks Cordoba!                
I have to say I am very happy with my guitar. It is great unplugged, and even better going through a PA. I play a lot of classical, but also James Taylor, Paul Simon, etc. and the guitar works perfectly for that style as well. I am also very  impressed by the customer service at zzounds. I had a problem with the first guitar I purchased and without hesitation they found a solution for me. Overall very satisfied with everything, the guitar is beautiful. I played many others in looking and this one stood out right away, strong sound, easy to play. Highly recommend.                 
The sound is different than what I am used to in a classical style guitar. Typically a Cedar/Rosewood guitar has a somewhat muted tonal quality. Not so on the C7-CE, and I welcome the difference in sound, which is more "crisp" - not bright but more pronounced - "livelier". And the low strings have a more acoustic steel string "wood" tonality which is not usually heard in a classical.                
I like the idea of the electronics, a piezo/mic combo with appropriate controls, and a built in tuner. Where this fails at is in two areas: 1) the guitar cord must be shoved all the way into the endpin jack past the point of where the actual connection would actually occur and even then the signal may cut out - I'd say it's a bad endpin jack; 2) the body of the electronics sometimes vibrates when the guitar is played - not so much a problem when playing live but when recording this gets picked up by the studio mic - not good!                
Action is excellent which makes the guitar easy to play, especially barre chords down on the first two/three frets.                
Very good craftsmanship.                
Overall it's a good value. I'd say one-step-up from comparable guitars also built in China.                
Have not contacted.                
It's a guitar. After 40+ years of playing the Wow Factor doesn't matter to me.                
Overall I'm pleased with the guitar but not so happy with the electronics.                
I'm new to classical guitar but I am happy with the cordoba I purchased. Sounds great unplugged and it stays in tune. Can't wait to get better and hear it amped up.                
Received it today and as soon as i pulled it ot of the box, i fell in love with the attention to detail in  the guitar design. Flawless exterior and immaculate finish. However, i believe the bass notes are not as robust as i thought they should be for a spanish classical. I have a 2 year old c5 cordova  and out of the box it sounded better. When i look inside the guitars to compare how they are braced, i noticed that the new c7 is slightly over braced than the c5. And true to spanish fan bracing, i prefer the torres fan bracing compared on the c5. The perpendicular bracing at the bottom of the top inside do not let it vibrate to it's fullest. One another thing that restricts the sound from is the thin plate directly under the bridge. This is not a true spanish fan bracing as advertised. All said, the guitar is an awesome deal at it's price range. zZounds has always been an excellent vendor of these guitars and their costumer service is second to none. I will always buy from them and although my critique may sound a little harsh, i did not compare this guitar to any other brand. That would be unfair to the cordova name.                 
I'm a 75 year old beginning guitarist and bought the Cordoba Cadete to have a smaller guitar than full size for ease of learning. The other feature I was looking for was the nylon strings to aid in learning. So far, I am delighted with my purchase and would recommend to all ages. The tone and appearance are wonderful.                
I've only had this guitar for three hours but I am mightily impressed. I don't have the biggest hands so my full size classical was really difficult to play cleanly. I sold that one (a Rodriguez) and bought this model. It is much easier to play and is prettier as well. The photos on the zZounds website makes this guitar appear to be a light shade of orange. The actual color is more of an a honey color. The guitar has a nice tone and projects well. It isn't as loud as a full size model but that's the trade off with a smaller body. I suspect it will sound better when I put on a fresh set of strings. The tuning keys are smooth and the white pearloid style buttons and gold tone metal really make the guitar look like a more expensive model. The action is within the tolerable range and the frets are well seated with no buzzes. The only criticism I have is with the edges of the frets - they are a tiny bit sharp. (That's an easy thing to remedy so it isn't really a big deal.) A shout-out to zZounds is how I will conclude this review. Their extended payment plans have made it too easy to expand my collection of guitars and amps. Thanks, y'all.                
I sold my 7/8 classical when I bought a full sized classical. Big Mistake. The neck was like a 2x4. I sold that one and browsed literally dozens of smaller models. The Cadete was the one affordable model I saw with consistently good reviews. It's not as loud as a full size model but in EVERY OTHER WAY it is a superlative instrument. It's well made and has a truss rod which is rare for the cheaper models. Out of the box the action was within the acceptable range so I haven't messed with the truss rod. The tuners are smooth but tight. It's beautiful to look at - the pics on the website make it look orange, which it isn't. If you're looking for a smaller size "parlor" guitar, this is a great choice. The stock strings are okay, not great but not bad.                
Sound is definitely bigger than its size but still Folkish, Latin and Classical. Somewhat limited in its utility depending on the users' musical style but very impressive full sound despite it's small size.                
Diminutive size makes it very easy to play for smaller players.                
Light weight, small size, low string action all make it easy to play.                
Excellent quality for it's price point. Wonderful finish and surprisingly good hardware allows it to stay in tune.                
Personally, I think it's worth MORE than it's selling price. But it seems to have held it since I bought it 10 years ago.                
N/a                
Great looking guitar in a small package                
I bought it for my Grand Daughter to learn on but I can't part with it. Beautiful Finish production materials and construction quality that produces a Full, Rich sound far beyond it's sub-$300 price point. Low string action makes it easy to play and it holds tune extremely well. I've had several Nylon string classical guitars as well as a Cordoba RCWE Thinline Acoustic Electric and it, too, ranks amoung my favorite Classical guitars in my collection..                
Sounds and feels like adult size cordoba. My son loved it . 
I first bought a C7 from zzounds and I thought nothing could get better. After a couple years of playing I finally realized that my hands were smaller then the normal Joes hands. So I was in search of a great instrument that fit my needs, and the Cordoba Cadete was EXACTLY that. I do not own my C7 anymore, but I can tell you for almost half the price the sound is extremely sweet. The finish was perfect. It came in record time (3 days) from NY to TX. For it being a little instrument, it is quite loud =D I couldn't be happier.                
This guitar the Cordoba F7 is exactly what I was looking for I have two very expensive flamenco guitars made by Lester Devoe,  I wanted a guitar that I would be able to travel with with no fuss and worry.  This guitar was the answer while it dose not sound like a DeVoe, its really no supposed to and would not even be fair to compare the two.  That being said,  The guitar in my opinion is absolutely amazing for this price point.  The sound it good, it has a flamenco vibe to it the back and side are laminate so they don't have the sound of a real blanca that is made with tone wood that is Cyprus.  Again this guitar is less than 500.00  The playable was a very nice surprise,  all up and down the fret board the notes ring and sound very good.  The playability is very easy and feels great on the left hand the neck is very well shaped and there are no frets sticking out on the side of the neck.  I installed a Fishman Ellipse Matrix Blend pick and mic and am very happy with the results.  I have no reservations in taking this guitar out to gig with.  I feel very good about the purchase and would recommend that anyone who is looking for a flamenco guitar and knows that if you really want that Flamenco sound you do need to spend more than 500.00  but if your goal is to have a great guitar that you can play, travel with, take to the beach, parties, fly with and be able to play and have it sound the way a flamenco guitar is supposed to as compared to a classical guitar then this is the guitar for you.  I have used the guitar in my studio and have been very happy with the results.  My purpose however was for a travel and live playing guitar that I would feel more comfortable with taking out.  When playing live in small settings I will be using the Roland BA 330 for my PA.                 
Came with a great light weight gig bag                
Tune play and rasagados right away and playing rumbas etc.                 
Finish is great, however there seems to be a sligh mismatch in the verner and the center wood stripe, dose not affect the sound at all just a mis to attention when building the gutiar. In no way is this a deal breaker in my opinion.  The gutiar looks great and the tunners felt good and keep string in tune,  I am used to pegs on my other gutiars.                 
To me the price was perfect and with Zzound 4 payments you can pick this guitar up for less than 130.00 a month, no one else offers that as far as I am aware.                
I have contacted Cordoba two times and they got back to me with answers very quick about a hard case, and the best pickup and size to install.  They were very kind as well and the information that they gave me was perfect to find a solution.                 
Looks like and feels like a true flamenco guitar                
I purchased this guitar to play when I travel, or play out in environments where taking a 8000.00 is just not wise.  For me this guitar is a keeper and solves many issues that I was facing while playing in small clubs, bars, restaurants etc.  I can use this guitar as well as a teaching guitar for students.   It meets my goals and expectations for a good working guitar to travel with and have a pick up and mic installed.                
First of all, the sound is very clean - there is no muddiness to it at all on any string. This is a quality that one should look for regardless of the guitar style.
The sustain is quite short - definitely shorter than my friends Cordoba C7 (classical). The trebles have a very bright sound (not the warm tone you have on a classical), and have an almost bell-like tendency to ring. The bass strings also sound great.
As a flamenco guitar should have, there is some fret buzz, though only on one string. The store owner said that if a true flamenco player bought the guitar, he would lower the strings to half their current height, so there would be fret buzz on all strings. I guess this is something I will experiment with later. All that being said, the buzz only appears when the string is played hard, and the buzz does not remain for long.
Overall, the sound of this guitar is amazing - I could find nothing better for the price among 50 or so guitars up to 1,000 dollars. It is really fitting of the flamenco/percussive style (and therefore not so fitting for classical compositions that require a warm tone - think Segovia).                
The truss rod is the feature that sets Cordoba apart from other guitars. Since I move around a lot to different climates, it is nice to have that option.
In terms of build, quality and finish, it is great overall - though there are some minor comments. The front and back of the guitar are not book-matched (looks good anyway). The color is a very pleasant white/gold combination, and the wood pattern is beautiful. Also, the frets protrude just a tiny bit from the neck at some points (again a minor point).
The woods used a fitting for the price range. I think it would be impossible to find a all solid-wood guitar for $500. So, a solid top is the best you can do.                
I found the guitar very playable. The action is about half as high as on my previous classical guitar. And despite having high tension strings, virtually no pressure is required to hold regular or barre chords. 
The low action and high tension also facilitate hammer-ons and pull-offs. 
It's not as playable as an electric of course, but it's as close as a true classical is going to get.                 
I found no quality issues with the guitar. Tuning is nice and smooth, and the guitar stays in tune for a couple of days at least.
Per dealer suggestion, I purchased an Oasis humidifier, and keep the guitar in the case/humidified during the winter months at least. With proper care, I don't see why it would not last 50-100 years.                 
I think that for the price, there is not a better flamenco guitar. You really get a lot for your money.                
It's a beautifully build light guitar, but for me sound and play-ability were the deciding factors.                
I settled on this guitar after a very thorough visit to a guitar shop specializing in classical guitars. Before, I had played an inexpensive $70 guitar for several years that was beyond repair.
I found this an exceptional guitar for the price in terms of features, sound, build quality, etc. 
A great easy guitar to play...excellent choice for beginning/budding flamenco guitarist has the playability needed to master many techniques...very growly and reasonable tone...best value for price...obviously the sound will not compare to solid body higher end guitars, but it is the playablity that makes me pick it up for practicing every time over my other guitars                
Good quality build and quality purfling, machine heads and rosette                
playability is excellent                
Extremely well made for the price                
Value for money A++++++++++++++++++++                
Not applicable                
Stupid question...only relevant to marketing people                
I would replace if lost or stolen                
I received the cordoba f7 I  Purchased in 4 days, undamaged and ready to play. Other than setting it up to my personal preferences, the guitar has not needed any major work done to it. A great guitar in my opinion,  with the quality and attention to detail in this price range I am happy with my decision.                  
For the price the sound quality is great.  Maybe a bit more buzz in the strings that people might like but I love playing it and actually like the tone for flamenco...I challenge any guitar to sound and feel so good for the price...                
For the price the model i have is excellent build.  The quality of machine heads and overall finish is amazing.                
I love playing it.  I have guitars up to $7K but when I practice I pick this one up every time...extremely light, easy peasey to play, love the feel and action...also take to paritrs etc...robust, good volume and poeple have commented on its unique sound...                
Couldn't ask for more given its price                
Enough said                
Not applicable...haven't experienced                
No comment...stupid question                
I have all the guitars I need...however if this was lost or stolen i would probably replace it because such good fun to play...                
After having Sam Ash service dept. lower the action and install La Bella 820, Travis the technician was quite excited about the sound and playability of this entry level/intermediate flamenco guitar. I would like to listen to a good flamenco player demo my F7 and comment on it. I know that this is all the guitar I will need to learn and improve.                
A flamenco guitar needs to have a loud and impetuous voice to complement the signer's  voice and the dancers feet and clapping sounds. It doesn't need the mellow sounds of the classical guitar but each can play the other style somewhat well  in the hands of a competent artist.                
I am confidant that a good flamenco player could make some great sounds with this guitar. It will be interesting to listen to it "open up" as gets older.                
The guitar's appearance is very nice and flawless for a factory made instrument from China. considering it's modest price.. I think that this guitar deserves good care and should not be treated as a "beach guitar" as some flamenco snobs seem to think                
I think that the controlled selling price, including the nice quality gig bag, is very reasonable                  
I have not had any direct contact with Cordoba yet, but their website has a lot of good information on care and use of their guitars                
I have always wanted a guitar that would inspire me to learn and improve my playing                
I am pleased with the appearance, sound, and overall playability of this guitar. I selected it over the Yamaha CG172 SF.                
I am blown away with the sound from this little guitar. It is loud! I read that the 12 fret fusion models sounded better acoustically than the 14 fret models. I played a 14 fret rose and several of the gk series a few weeks ago but none of them sounded this good. The neck is so nice it fells like it was made for my hand with easy access to the 19th fret. Action was a tad high for my taste but the neck was dead straight and no buzzing or dead spots anywhere. Frets are level and smooth on the edges. The wood on mine is beautiful. Nice book-matched spruce and straight grained rosewood accented with mahogany purfling and a flawless finish make for a visually beautiful guitar. But the best part is the tone. I should have tried a cedar top too but this spruce top is really amazing sounding. This baby stacks up to any nylon string that I have played at a fraction of the cost and the most comfortable neck I have ever wrapped my hand around. The pickups sound awesome. I don't know if I got lucky or they all sound this good . I have to drive a very long way to get to a decent guitar store so I'd rather try it out first but you cant go wrong with a 30 day return policy and pay as you play. I didn't think my search would be over so quick but I'm glad it is. Thanks zzounds!                
I learned to play guitar on a Western Auto Silvertone steel string.  After mastering chords and some symbalence of rhythm I moved on to a nylon string guitar where I learned to do some basic finger picking.  Always liked the sound of a nylon stringed guitar.  As I got older I moved on to the larger dreadnaught Martin D28 and it goes without saying the sound of a good Martin is very good.  Now that I am older(61) and some arthiritis I wanted to try and find a smaller bodied guitar.  Maybe a classical but remembered how wide the neck was on my old classical guitar so started researching and ran across the Cordoba web site and started reading about their Fusion Orchestra CE Classical guitar.  I liked the smaller neck Cordoba used.  I also liked the light weight and smaller size.  It took me a while to get used to the sound of the guitar.  I have always believed that a person needs to learn how to strike the strings to get that guitar's benefits.  After spendings about two months playing the Cordoba I am starting to get the good sound this guitar has.  This is a fine guitar for the money you spend. Play  this instrument  and discover the wonderful sounds within.                
Great full body sound. Really warm clean tone. The fishman system is amazing.Would totally recommend this to all skill levels.Gig bag is sharp with a cool grey color.                
I'm a guitar player, i keep on learning classical guitar as well as writing my own songs iI wanted a guitar that i could use to do both and still would look amazing, i tested the C7 and c5 both full acoustic and elec-acoustic and then i tested this one and felt in love. i tested on guitar center but ordered from zzounds because they let you pay on 4 payments and thats amazing i receive the guitar fast and comes with an amazing cordoba gig bag. Get it!!! you will love it                
I had never purchased a guitar sight unseen before. I had always spent days trying out various instruments until I found "The One"! So it was with trepidation that I ordered this one. When it arrived, I was very pleased at its appearance. After tuning, I was blown away by the sound. I know a dedicated classic guitar will sound better (a little) but I am extremely happy with my purchase                
I am very pleased with the purchase of my GK Studio Cordoba nylon string guitar, and highly recommend it for playability and value.  I am a steel string player who has switched to nylon string guitars in order to play more musical styles.  I wanted to learn to read music by learning classical guitar and have now found a nylon string guitar a must for all my finger style playing.  The problem has been finding a nylon string guitar that is playable and sounds good with a variety of musical styles.  I have been searching endlessly for one that is smaller than your typical classical and has a sound that is brighter.  I discovered that a Flamenco Negra guitar provides the bright sound I am looking for in addition to a thinner body. The GK Studio Negra is perfect for me. With the feature of a tress rod my repair man was able to get the action to 2mm at the 12th fret. Wow, great going Cordoba.  A 50 mm nut width and the thinner neck depth adds playability without sacrificing being able to play classical music on this guitar.  The final touch is the cutaway to reach the upper frets.  The sound of this guitar is excellent for the ticket price.
My only reserve is that this guitar is not made of all solid wood and has a whole in it for electronics.   I am a purist and can hear the difference in a solid wood guitar and prefer to have passive amplification.  Although this guitar sounds great and is perfect in all the functional aspects, I will be looking for another guitar.  This GK Studio will be used for practice and "knocking around" while I save my money for a solid wood guitar with no electronics cut out.   
I highly recommend this guitar for the price range, sound, and playability.  Even if I buy a higher quality solid wood guitar in the future, I will not get rid of my GK Studio.                  
Ive had my Gk studio Negra for about 2 weeks now and i have to say that I havent picked up any of my other guitars since. I just love how this little powerhouse sounds. Its is very light weight and super comfortable to play. The action when i got it needed a bit of a tweak but I was able to get it super low without buzz. The guitar looks absolutelly beautiful and plays like a dream. I havent plugged mine in yet but I look forward to doing so soon. I have however played one plugged in at my local music store and was blown away at how it sounded using the Fishman loudbox mini amp. You cant go wrong with the price and value of this instrument especially if you travel. The tuners are beautiful and keep the instrument in perffect tune. The onboard electronics are nice, like i said, i havent plugged mine in but the onboard tuner is great. If you are looking into getting a new classical/flamenco style guitar get this one...you wont be dissapointed.                 
I received my of my GK Studio Cordoba nylon string guitar today and I have to say this guitar is just outstanding. It stand up to any custom made guitar from any Luther costing $3,000 to $5,000. I never expected that such a affordable guitar could sound so great. The craftsmanship together with the cosmetic look is just fabulous. I highly recommend the of my GK Studio Cordoba nylon string guitar. I've been playing for over 55 years and have seen, played, and owned high end guitars and this one is just as high end. The bass response and the highs are right on the button. I am a very particular as far as my guitars. They must sound outstanding and also look great as far as presentation. Over all this one is will be right with me anytime I go out and do my gigs and also play in our worship team. Five stars.                
I have played many guitars in 50 years as a musician, but the Cordoba GK Studio Negra guitar is a dream. The other day my son used in a recital at school and other students performers borrowed for their performance. Great Guitar!!! Bravo for Cordoba.                
Recently I purchased a Cordoba GK Studio series guitar through zZounds. this was my first purchase with them, and I purchased it through their 4-payment plan program.  When I received the guitar, I noticed that the guitar had two dents in the wood work, one on each side of the sound hole. I later discovered a short in the electrical wiring within the guitar plug. I notified zZounds of the discrepancies, and without any hesitation they sent me a free UPS return label and assured me that as soon as the item was returned to UPS and scanned, they would send me a replacement. zZounds lived up to their word. Within days, I received the replacement guitar that was in perfect condition. I couldn't be happier with their customer service.
I have to further give them great thanks for their zero interest payment program. As a working musician unable to get credit anywhere, zZounds steps up to the plate and offered me the guitar I've been wanting for years but couldn't afford. Their "Pay as you Play" program is hassle free, didn't rely on credit score, and I was accepted by zZounds where every other mega-musician store turned me down. For this, I am now a loyal fan of zZounds and will be a returning customer soon, making them my #1 place to supply my music business.                
Had purchase a different brand and had to return because it sounds terrible. Had my reserves on the Cordoba, my in-law is a guitar teacher and has a Cordoba and also a Martin. I order the Cordoba and this instrument sound great, nice feature and super quality, easy to use and the wood looks great I mean it is beautiful, it just give you a wow! Impression. Can't let go of it. Very light, great electronics, the gig bag is very nice.  I have lot to say about this great instrument, but I want to go back and play a little more or maybe a lot.                
It has a great sound quality that exceeds higher priced guitars.                 
Wow looking material, great craftsmanship and beautiful design. All seems in harmony.                 
Very light, easy to play with great nylon strings.                
It has a Fishman onboard electronics a tuner that works perfectly and great details.                
Worth every penny compared to other brands.                
Have not need to contact them.                
It take your breath away and you can't let go of it.                
I have played other guitars that cost 3 or more times as this beautiful GK Studio Negra from Cordoba. This is a great guitar, sound awesome, beautiful wood, great price and it has that wow factor that takes your breath away. Overall it a great guitar, you can’t find other guitars that sound so great at this price and give you the satisfaction of worth every penny.                 
I have played all types of mini guitars and 90% have horrible intonation.. Meaning in standard tuning, a D chord might be perfectly in tune and then an E chord would be ridiculously OUT OF TUNE!  This is a GREAT mini electric/acoustic guitar!  It has the sound of a ukulele with the playability and tuning of a small acoustic guitar.                
I am a seasoned guitarist of more than 50 years...That's right! This instrument is gig-worthy. Looks good, sounds good, and stays in tune after the usual nylon string thing stretch. play banjo style, mando style, ethnic...whatever you can do o this mini axe. Where ever your expertise takes you. Enjoy!!                
I absolutely love this guitar, I'm petite and have small hands so I wanted a light but high quality guitar and I didn't go wrong with this one. The wood is gorgeous, the sound is amazing and you can't argue with the price for all these amazing qualities. The gig case is a great addition. I am very satisfied.

I am just starting to learn and am working overseas, so I needed a small guitar. This guitar fit the bill perfectly. It sounds good to my ears and the nylon strings aren't as hard on my fingers as I thought they would be. I hope to get good at playing and I think this is a great guitar to get started. The price was right, and so is the size (I don't have a lot of room in my little hooch).                
Thought they were battery operated.But, for the price, not bad at all                
Just got this ukulele about a week ago and it sounds great both acoustic and plugged in. I haven't had any trouble with it so far, so that's been good. The neck feels great and the cutaway is a great feature. My only qualm is the finish has some rough spots. You can't see the spots, but you can feel them, so really it's just annoying, doesn't ruin the looks or anything. Other than that though, the quality seems really good!                
This is the first time, ever, that I was able to take a NEW guitar to rehearsal and then, play a concert with it the next day, without the need of any adjustments.  Even my custom made instruments required a day at the Luthier's shop just to adjust the action for my playing and strings - with the GK Studio I had to do nothing (other than replacing the strings) - with a minimal eq the guitar sounded just beautiful - I am very pleased with its amplified sound and since my endorsement with another pickup system is expired I have been searching for a new one that would sound better and be more reliable.  I have now found it.
 the GK is perfect in every way.  I don't know how you guys do it but, I am pleased that I have tried it - perfect timing too for my upcoming projects.                
For years I have been playing a simple, low end Yamaha flamenco guitar due to... well, what can I say, I'm a working musician.  THANKS to Zzound.com and Cordoba Guitars, I was finally able to afford this GK Studio Negra guitar, and let me say that after playing it, it is WORTH EVERY DOLLAR that it is priced at.
To begin with, it arrived at my home double boxed, and further more padded in the inner box to ensure the safest shipping possible.
To my surprise, unlike other guitars it came with its very own Cordoba soft case that wasn't even mentioned in the sale info.  (BONUS!!!).  
The sound from the guitar resonates much longer than other guitars I've tested, and the tone from the guitar is much warmer than the others as well.  Right out of the box, I was able to use the onboard tuner which is one less thing I have to have on stage.  The action is absolutely amazing on this guitar, and even better, you can adjust the tension rod to your liking right between the strings in just a few seconds.
The onboard adjustments truly solve having to hover around the soundboard.  The three band EQ is standard, and it has additional adjustments to balance the pickups and inboard mic, along with adjustment to eliminate low end feedback.
The only minor drawback is not having pegs for a guitar strap on it, but that is an easy fix, as I was planning to get a custom strap for it anyhow.  As a fan of the Gipsy Kings, who have reigned for over 30 years with the Spanish guitars, Cordoba truly honored their name with this Gipsy King series Studio guitar.  And I myself, and now proud to be both an owner and performer with this Cordoba GK Studio guitar.
the sound is perfect for a flemenco guitar.  it is crisp, the basses are deep and resonate well.                
great features                
this guitar was already set up, i didn't even need to change the strings.                
for the price, this is great!                
I would pay twice this amount at other companies for the same quality.                
I have had this guitar for only two months.  I will enjoy it for many years to come.  I have played guitar for over 35 years now.                
I just got me this guitar as a Fathers Day gift. I spent time, as I say test driving it and others. One of the things I look for is when the guitar lets me take it and it becomes one with me. Anywhere my fingers go the soud stay smooth and clear. Action all the way is tremendous and rewarding. By that I am rewarded with the sounds I get so clear I smile. Took hours matching it against a Taylor which I am favorable to. I tried so hard to like the Taylor, Yamaha, and others, but I still came back to the Cordoba. It was what I was seeking to get the soud I wanted. I paly it more now than my steal string guitars. Good stuff!!! "{)                
Bought this guitar new from local authorized dealer. Sounded good in the store and liked the spruce top that produced a nice sound. Got it home and sat down to really try it out. It was then that I saw the guitar had a crack that was about 3/4 of an inch or so running through width of the soundboard at the lower curve of the cut out through the width of the wood. Looked like a chunk of the soundboard could come off.Worse is that there was a smear of what looks like grey Elmer's wood filler on the underside of soundboard where the crack was repaired (factory rework??) at the intersection of the neck and the cut out. This was not a B grade guitar that I purchased, but Cordoba Quality Control is not there.I don't know whether Cordoba contracts out manufacturing or if they buy pre-cut tops or cut their own. Calls into question the quality of material they use, and how something defective, reworked gets to an end-user. Amateur player who has a couple of steel stringed acoustics, Yamaha classical that was redone with new bone nut and bridge. Studying classical as a school elective.                
I've owned this guitar for almost 2 years and LOVE it!                
First off, thank goodness for zZounds' stellar return policy. I had my GK Studio for a week before I decided to return it. The guitar sounds very weak and has no bass at all. Honestly, I think it sounds like a toy. I went as far as to try others at local music stores; none of them sounded much better. I previously owned a Cordoba 30f, which is discontinued, and find myself wishing I still had it. The 30f was a proper student flamenco with a vastly superior tone. I think this us due to the fact that it was made in Spain instead of the Chinese made GK Studio. 
Build quality on the GK Studio is very skeptical too. The frets on mine were jagged on the edges of the fingerboard and it had a boatload of fret buzz and dead notes. A flamenco guitar should have some fret buzz, but not to the extent i had in mine.  Adjusting the truss rod fixed things a bit, but not entirely. A proper guitar setup would have been in order if I kept it. I also noticed some carelessly glued sections on the guitar. It really didn't inspire confidence that it would last five years of playing flamenco. 
I really, really wanted to like this guitar, but it just does not fit the bill. Look elsewhere if you want a well-rounded and proper flamenco guitar.                 
The spider capo presses firmly on the strings, creating a clear sound without buzz.                
It works equally as well on 12-stringed guitars, too!                
I would like it better if it fastened to the guitar neck faster.  As it is, one must hold it with one hand while tightening a screw using finger and thumb with the other.  For studio work or just playing around it would be fine.                
The spider capo appears to be well-made.  I've only had it for a month, so we'll see....                
Compared to better capoes, the value for the spider capo is good.                
This thing is great!  I never use a capo normaly.  I can play in any key at any time.  Where this comes in handy is when I'm playing slide on my dobro.  I don't have to keep changing the tunings or have more than one dobro on stage with me.  I use two at a time for even more diversity.                
The fact that you can select what notes to use on any given fret is great.   I usually place one on the second and third frets of my dobro.                  
Just put the thing on the neck of your guitar and select which notes you want to use and your done.  It could not be easier.                
It is made well, I have never had a problem with it.  Like anything else, it should last quit a while, as long as you take care of it.                
I only paid $19.95 for each one of mine.  It was money well spent!                
Never needed any.                
I can't imagine anyone comming up with another product that is any better.  If anything ever happens to mine I will buy another one right away.                 
I've used the SpiderCapo XXL both for my Squier Stagemaster 7 (7-string electric) and my Ibanez GA3 (nylon string, classical) and it does well with both so far. I haven't played for any extended periods of time with it but it does its job cleanly.
Going with the XXL size of the SpiderCapos was the better choice for me since both the guitars I play more often have wider necks; one at 2" and the other at 1 7/8" (G3 and Stagemaster, respectively). It does actually seem to latch pretty well to 4th fret (just barely under 1 7/8") and up of the neck of my Crestwood flat-top steel string. The neck is too thin for the XXL capo at the 1st and 2nd frets. Since that guitar's pending repairs I can't tell you how exactly it performs from experience, but I have a feeling it would do fine.                
This capo did not work. I bought it because it was the only capo I could find that was designed to fit 8-string guitars. It didn't hold down the strings very well to begin with. And as soon as I tried to bend a string, the string slid right out from under its individual capo-piece thing. Pathetic. It also looks absolutely ridiculous.
Also, the idea that a capo could be used to create alternative tunings is nonsense. For one, it obviously prevents access to the frets nearest the headstock, so the first few frets of any strings that are not individually-capoed are rendered useless. For two, it can only individually-capo strings to one fret. More than one capo would be needed to individually-capo strings to other frets, further-restricting the playability of the neck. Just re-tune, it won't kill you!!!
Thankfully, I found a solution: if you play an extended-range guitar and are looking at this capo, go for a 12-string guitar capo instead.                
Best laptop stand for an excellent price! The ability to adjust the stand to fit your needs makes the stand one of the best and the price makes this product the BEST! Very durable and the dark gray that I ordered, blends well with the controller and table. Great Job Crane!                
Stable. Sturdy stand for your Laptop or Mid-size Controller. I have a few stands. This is the best one so far.                
There almost no difference from the pro stand and the plus expect the tray. For 80 bucks it a no brainier.                 
Does what it says it does, kit comes with everything you'll need to adjust your guitar. I've even used the capo in a pinch, though it's not really meant for playing. Oh and it comes with a setup guide for the newb which is pretty helpful.                
Sounds okay for something that doesn't make a sound.  But once you use this kit to get your guitar set up properly your guitar will definitely sound and play much better.                
A guitar tech obviously put a lot of thought as to what should go into this kit. This kit contains everything that I need to set up my guitars, with one noteable exception: an offset screwdriver for adjusting floating trem claws. Otherwise I have a use for every tool in this kit.  Some people may be put off by the seemingly delinquent capo, but it's there to capo off your first fret for measuring neck relief, NOT for barring off for playing in different keys.
This kit will most likely fit into the outer pocket of most gig bags but it's a little too bulky to fit into any of my hardshell cases.                
I still haven't quite figured out how to use the screwdriver yet...lol!
But seriously, all of these tools perform their function well.  There's an included setup guide to get you going, but if you don't really understand what you're doing with any particular procedure then STOP and take it to a tech to show you.  No sense in ruining your guitar just to save a few bucks.                
Topnotch quality! No skimping here in the quality of the components. The cutters are plenty hefty to get the job done, the screwdriver has a strong feel to it, and the allen keys all seem sturdy enough. The flashlight is also very sturdy.                
If you were to buy all of these tools separately you'd spend a lot more money and a lot of time running to different stores to find what you needed (been there. done that.). So it's definitely a great value.                
This should be on every serious guitarist's must have list.                
I already had a toolbox filled with accumulated tools and odds and ends that I've picked up over the years.  But sometimes "more" means less. I could never seem to find the tool that I needed when I needed it. Now the most essential tools that I seem to use the most are in a nice compact case, ready to go.  It's also very portable, which means I can take it with me instead of having to randomly grab tools out of the toolbox, usually taking way more than I'll need "just to be safe".  Overall, a relatively inexpensive way to treat your guitar(s) right.                
This is a great little kit for somebody wants to get into fixing their own guitars up. I only have one complaint and that's the fact that the spring fell out of the string cutter.                
This has everything you need to work on & tune a Guitar & Bass !!                
Sweet kit for keeping guitar in top shape.                
These cutters work great. The design doesn't allow for a built in method of closing the cutters but if you just slip something over the closed handles that will work. I've used other ones in the past that don't cut guitar strings very well at all.                
This Kit has everything I need to take with me to gigs.
Just the right tools for all my guitars in a handy convenient carry pouch.
Don't have to go digging through my tool box searching for a tool at a gig.
Less time digging. 
More time gigging.                
Well, I got my stagehand kit and it looked great and had everything they said they would send, however, the first guitar I needed to adjust was a Fender Strat, and guess what? It didn't work. There is a hex wrench tip, but the handle gets in the way. I think maybe on some other guitars it may work fine, but I can tell you that if it won't work on one of the most owned guitars in the world, I have doubts.                
I purchased this 4-Bar flex to go with my 4-Bar Tri USB which I also purchased from zZounds.com It works great an overall great bar. I have not been disappointed with either of the 4-Bars by Chauvet and will be purchasing a third one from zZounds very soon. This is a great bar that works great and is bright. Looks great with haze and fog. If your looking for a lighting solution for your band these 4bars are the way to go.                 
Couldn't be happier with these lights! I bought 2 sets of these and used them for the first time on an outdoor stage shining onto the dance floor. These lights are very bright and very easy to set up. I already had the Gigbar IRC so the wireless remote worked with these lights as well and made it so easy to control them. Worth the money!                
great bag , good quality and keeps my Chauvet led lights well protected                
perfect size for my Chauvet EZ wedge tri                
Cool light. I use laser printer and transparency paper to make color logos for gigs. Bright than I expected but cheaply made for the price. CHAUVET and ADJ are far from top shelf though...                
Built like a tank and no cords. What's not to like?                
For a small stage or ambient wall lighting, they'll do well. There should, by now, be multiple or better placed IR sensors. It is highly impractical for there to only be one sensor, located on the lighting face.                
great product the only thing is that u have to plug a sigle outlet per cannon because will shut down your breakers                
Just received these today (bought 4), unboxed and hooked up. These lights are very bright, sound mode is very responsive, and nicely built. Only negative thing I could say about them is that there isn’t a protective cover over the front of the lights. Hopefully it won’t be an issue... You basically get multiple lights in one. Strobes are crazy!!!Will be using them this weekend. No controller, just master/slave sound mode.                
These thing will bring up your DJ or live show up a few notches! I bought it as a addition to my old lights and truss that is huge about 10ft wide and no movement just flash lighting since moving lights are so expensive I went with the Gigbar. I tried it at home loved it and decided to risk just using it as a primary...Did my first gig with it WOW lit up a 100 by 50 banquet room with a 20ft ceiling this thing was beautiful for now I am ok with one but seriously considering running 2! Buy it NOW you will not regret it!                
I ordered one of the original GigBar when they first come out, and loved it, I now have that one and one of the GigBar2, they have replaced my truss system and all the lights I had to put on and take off each event. These have made my life so much better and my back loves me for it.                
More than likely you have heard or seen the reviews on this light. As a buyer and a owner of this light i can say it's all true the great things you have heard. it will enhance any party or GIg you will have. You want a blue, red, amber, green, or white light show at the touch of a button this what you want. The quality on this light is spintacular, just be very careful with the antenna on the foot switch. zZounds is the best in pay as you play and shipping product. So again What Are You Waiting For? P.S. One other great thing about this GigBar 2 is the easy time to set up and break down. DJ Hammer                
I'm a mobile DJ so I am very dependent on time. This gig bar is an amazing all in one. Is it the most extravagant NO. It does offer the clients a great dance floor feel and once you truly master the ease of the already preset controls you can make the dance floor pop.
I have both the IRC model and the gig bar 2. I will say having these in master/slave is an amazing show. One drawback I have is the IRC does not have the UV so if I make the Gigbar2 the master then when it activates the UV nothing happens on the IRC model. So when I use them in master/slave I have to put the IRC as master which is no big deal. I just did a project graduation and with both of these as well as 20 up lights the stage and cafeteria looked great. Covered the whole floor perfectly.                
This is very good bar is amazing I've got nothing but compliments it feels large to medium size rooms and no problem. It is so easy to set up easy to use great functions I am nothing but impressed with what Chauvet has released with this great product. On top of that I found the item cheaper on another site and zZounds without any hesitation immediately offered me the price a little bit lower than the already lower price I found. It's a no-brainer to purchase from zZounds and to buy this complete all in one system.                
No sound but it can be setup for sound activation.                
For the price your not going to get a better lighting system. And after all the YouTube reviews, this is the most sought after lighting system for the mobile and in home DJ.                
Right out of the box setup is a breeze. All the programs will take a bit of learning but no problem. Even for those of us that are brand new to this.                
Well made, the cases that came with it are a major plus. And easy to transport for being mobile. Plug and play feature is really great.                
Not sure of the value. Not good at that type of thing. But for me on a payment plan from zZounds. It was well worth buying.                
Still waiting to hear back from them. The power cord supplied was way too short, factory goof up. Had to buy a longer one. And 1 of the cams was put on upside down.But so easy to fix.                
Have yet to try it out at a gig. But in my home it is a wow zee wow wow. LOL Wait till the sun goes down to get the true full effect.                
If your brand new to lighting as I am. Then this product is for you. Setup is so easy and interchanging the cams is a breeze. Price and zZounds.com make this a very good buy. Especially on their payment plan.                
This system works great for mobile DJ applications. I have two of these controlled by DMX and they'll cover an audience up to 200. I added some moving heads, and it's all I need! Makes setup and take down much quicker.
Would love to see a "GigBar Pro" with upgraded lights!                 
I'm a Mobile DJ and was originally looking for something with multiple lighting effects in a moderate-sized package. Only con I have is the sound activation. I wish there was a sound activated setting that takes out the strobes, as the strobes work almost too well. But this is nothing a DMX controller won't fix, which paired with an Obey 70 and an additional GigBar 2, this is a must for my setup. Also, I marked a 3 on the Manufacturer Support, as I have not had to deal with Chauvet at all, since the quality is fantastic.                 
This will wow your clients and friends socks off!  If you use them for a dance they make for a great and easy night. If you use them for a staged show the sequins and stones on a dress with light up beautifully.  So Far I'm in love with chauvet!                
This is a great package for the mobile DJ that doesn't want the hassle of programming DMX lighting, Lightbar is literally a LIGHT BAR as it isnt' heavy in the least. It goes up in a matter of seconds and the wireless remote and footswitch make it great to change up the lighting programs with ease. Footswitch however does feel like if you step a bit too heavy it could easily break ( I have a size 13 1/2 foot so this is a concern for me). All in all, GREAT unit for an amazing price.                
I am a new mobile DJ. This is a perfect set up with amazing mobility but more importantly it lights up with great effects a nice size room. The laser light is a bright two color red and green. The 4 strobes are fantastic and the pars and derby lights are great. It can be set up and taken down in minutes. This is a great set of lights that allows for growth when ready.

Very Good Product                
Yes                
No feedback yet                
WOW WOW WOW                
Purchased this lighting system after reading a lot of reviews and watching u-tube demos. It is definitely a great system right out of the box. All wireless controls were included as well as carrying case and bag for stand. zZounds delivered it in two days as promised and I haven't had a problem with it.                
this light system yes is all in one very easy to set up very bright and comes with all you need to get started also it's a bang for the buck you have strobe, uv, pars,lazers all in one unit can not go wrong with this one here.                
What a great buy. I'm a mobile dj and this is perfect to move around from place to place and is really am all in one setup... lights are extremely bright and great effects. Right out the box ready to go..                
I have used the GigBar Flex at 6 events so far, and have had lots of compliments on how cool it looks!! Love the fact that I can mount it under my speaker using the SAME tripod!! I've also mounted it on a separate light stand. This light is super bright, fills up a good size room. Setup / teardown time is fast. Definitely worth the price!! Will be buying another soon!!                
I bought this for a wedding last year (yeah I procrastinated about posting a review) I bought it because it is portable, lightweight and easy to take from gig to gig. The ability to print Gobo's was a plus, but I have yet to have great success with my own printed gobo's. You are most likely better off getting them made as I found out. It could be that I didnt have a compatable printer, but it worked, ok.. not great but the client was happy. If you have metal ones made, it is an outstanding unit. works great, throws great light and its a great upsel. I charge $150-250 extra to have the gobo rental for a wedding with the custom made gobo. You really cant go wrong with this for small to medium even medium to large venues. I had an ROI on my 2nd gig with it.                
This haze machine will put out the haze. I've run it for a total of 12 hours between 2 gigs and I still have half a tank of fluid left! I keep it on time delay and it keep the haze in the air. I've run it on continuous for about 5 minutes and it was thick in the venue. The haze makes your lights pop and brings a whole new element to any lighting rig. Well worth the investment! It takes a while to warm up, but once its ready... watch out. I would suggest running it on a 5 minute delay.                 
Says it works up to 30 ft away thats not true , 10 ft if that ,,have several fixtures and operates all the same distance,,returned first remote thought it might be defective but 2nd remote did same thing ,,ok for house parties but for a small gigs it not worth it                
This is a very nice mirror ball simulator with high-power, quad-color LEDs.  You can set up to whichever speed you require, along with 3 LED zones emitting up to 3 different colors simultaneously.  Another bonus with this product is the 100-240hz rating.  I work worldwide, so this is very important.  It comes with a bracket for mounting and you can save time running cables and extension cords by power linking multiple units. No remote necessary, but it’s optional for an additional price.                
I must say  that this laser was worth the money.  well built, trusted company, 2year warranty, great visuals..  i cant find anything negative.  goes on stage with us this july 4th!.                  
This Lazer is one of the strongest lights i have ... I have over 40 lights in my show and this outshines them all and makes my light show extra nice :-)... if you're looking for the best light especially with this price I suggest get a few of these you won't ever regret it...                
i love using this laser. it has some really cool air effects when you mix it with fog. i loved it so much i bought 2.                
We bought two of these . Very cool . Deffinately brought the light show  up a few notches.    It would be nice to be able to get affordable RED or BLUE versions .                
Very well made light! This is an awesome light for the money so I got two of them...                
I was very skeptical because when I first tested this fixture I was at a very small bar, however, when I took it to a nice size hall this one light was amazing even with the hall's bright lights being on. When they finally turned the lights off---OMG and I used no smoke I could just imagine if I used my Chauvet Mist machine this light would have been even more outstanding...I say its a must buy.                
Originally, I bought a couple of these for my cover band but found they were a little hard to control while I was playing. I've since added them to my DJ Rig and Wow!, They really are the professional touch I needed. They sit on the same poles as a couple of Chauvet 4Bar Flex's I purchased earlier and since I bought Two, they qualified for zZounds Payment plan! I paid for both of them with my first DJ Gig!!                
I bought one of these brand new for $225. Right out of the box, I was highly impressed! It has some very neat capabilities in its pre programmed shows. I still use it pretty regularly in my DJ gigs. Only problem (and it has been a big one at times) is that not long after I had gotten it, might've used it 6 times, one of the motors inside it quit working. So I stil have the lights showing, but no motor to make them spin. Not sure if motor actually went out or if it's just freezing up?? It works sometimes and others, it doesn't. Not a good look for being in middle of show, using DMX, and you click your next light show step and boom, the light freezes. It even does it when it isn't connected to DMX. I'm giving it A slightly lower rating for how quickly it tore up, but still has awesome potential.                
Bought 2 of these to check them out for my Truss system & let me tell you, these little guys put out PLENTY of light.Great buy for the price. zZounds ship these out the next day..I do believe we will NOT be buying from any other company, only from zZounds.                
i bought this amp to replace a cheap gem sounds 1000 amp and i'm extremely impressed with the difference in power and sound quality. i bought it to power a set of peavey  sp 5g 15 inch tops and it does a great job i couldn't have asked for better sound, power and price.                  
The Crown XLI Amplifier in my opinion is one of the best sounding power amps for that kind of money. Don't take my word for it; just read as much information as you can on Crown power amps and you will find that they are in fact the best. Here is some inside information that you will not read anywhere. I am a retired engineer out of NASA and worked on non retrievable spacecraft all my life. In this business we have what you call a (acoustic sound test) for every spacecraft. All the acoustic sound testing was performed by Crown power amps. Hope this will help people understand that Crown amps are in a class of there own.                
I use this amp to power two RBH 4 ohm passive subs. While setting the sub max volume setting in the receiver, it requires one to push the subs to the point of distortion, then set the max just below. I could never reach the point of distortion. Every door, wall, window,cabinet, subfloor etc seemed to come alive as the twin subs hit their stride. The cone movement was tremendous. When I glanced down, the clip indicators remained quiet. The Crown amp and the subs still had some gas in the tank. The sheer power on display was sort of frightening. Any more volume and I may be hanging new Wall board. The depth and power of the sonic waves could only come from an amp with real nuts to it. They went right through your body. 
I learned a few things. Two of these RBH subs for my room size is silly, and the Crown 1500 is overkill. I will never tax this amp. How do they do it for 299.00???                
I love this amp. I'm a person who looks for great, realistic sound, life like. This amp and a BBE Sonic Maximizer, two old school 15" Super Pro Woofers, two 8" Selenium JBL speakers and a couple Klipsch Heresy tweeters in two large speaker boxes on wheels. Sounds awesome and gives a memorable listening experience! This amp is clean. It is quiet when nothing is playing. I would highly recommend this amp. It's heavy, which to me means quality as Crown is known for.     I also like that the only difference between this one and the other LXI models is the wattage. All the LXI models have the same specs as the one I bought, such as THD. To me, this means quality going in, all the same in quality specs, no matter what wattage you order.                
I have been using a Hafler XL-280 to power my two RBH 1010-sen subs. It is a bit light for the job at 200 watts @ 4 ohm, and cooks in my cabinet. Sub amps run up to 1k or more, and I would need two to drive four 10” reference class speakers. 
When I started looking at the specs for this amp, it matched my subs power requirement perfectly. I know what quality power sounds like, and does this amp ever deliver. The sub drivers reach max excursion with power to spare. You feel them as much as hear them. 
I did have a ground loop issue to solve but it was straightforward to fix. I hear no fan noise and it’s cool to the touch. I plays nice with my pioneer Elite 59txi. The power led died in one day, but amp functions fine. 
Love the experience with the crown amp I would suggest that everyone should own one                
This amp is amazing, deliveries a crystal clear sound for my gemini dual 15" , I put them with a pair or jr earthquakes (cerwin vega) and the sound is amazing.                 
This amp makes my speakers very happy                
Purchased this amp to replace my old CS1000. CS just did not have enough to properly drive my DJS4's, but boy does this amp. I never need to go above 1/4 gain to drive the mains well. Will be picking up 2 more of these in the near future when I expand the system.                
This thing rocks....I tried a digital Class D amp and was not impressed.  Returned if for the Crown XLI3500.  Rich thick sound that brings your speakers alive.  Its the real deal.                
I bought this amp on the play as you pay plan. I'm glad I did. I'm a 39 yr entertainer. I've dealt a lot with peavey amps. Not because of sound. But they are so reliable. I've also owned some behringer. They are good amps. But they overstate the specs. This amp is the best I've owned. It has power to spare. Looks good on my rack. And it sounds better than any amp I've heard. Until now I thought amps were just a power source. Now I realize that it has a profound effect on the way my music sounds. Bass is punchier, mids are clean and highs are crisp. You can buy cheaper amp. But for under $700. This amp can't be beat......BUY IT You'll love it. I havent needed tech support yet. Its ease of use is why. I don't need dps. I prefer my own separate xover and eq.                
We used this amplifier for our Easter concert outside in front of our church Packsaddle Fellowship. We were driving my Cerwin-Vega PB-18B Boxes. There were 15 singers, 3 keyboards, my 100 Watt Marshall half stack and another guitarist through a Fender amp and Bass and drums. The sound was crystal clear and beautifully loud enough to be well projected to the entire area. We had the XLI at just about 50% OF MAX. We had many people there and the comments on the mix and the sound were all extremely positive, even from very well trained ears. THANK YOU,  ZZOUNDS FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE! Thanks be to God for this blessing.                
The sound is awsome, response is excellent to any music style. Just hook it up right, and you will enjoy everything.                
Crown Thought of everything needed to use this amp with. guitars, bass, flangers, sustains, overdrive units. Selection was great.                
Better than crest, qsc, etc. The amp works great and well with any other product. Very playable, fun to operate. Nice bright crown power on light.                
Yes. it is well build and sturdy. With Crown products you rely on high quality sound and features. Crown is the "King" of musical thinking.                
Absolutely, You will waste your time and energy trying to prove it otherwise.                
Yes, Crown is always extremely supportive, friendly with any issue their product owner has. I had no problems. Not with Crown.                 
Looks wonderful in your rack. Anyone would want this amp if they love power music. You can't make much good music without it.. Ya Know!                
This amp is a great value, has plenty of power to service all applications. Crown has giving us music lovers an amp that can provide 1000 watts per channel of pure power. 43 pounds is easy to transport for touring. It stays extremely cool and lets you know when you are getting stupid trying to overdrive it. Everyone, get this amp for all your musical needs.                
This crown amp brings out details in instruments that other amps in it's price range or in some cases twice it's price range could not touch.Great amp would recommend to anyone that does not need dsp.                
It has a input sensitivity switch that is real helpful if your running it through a receiver.                
Plug and play                
Construction seems solid after all it weighs 43lbs.                
Hard to beat.                
Hope i do not need any.                
No i would not want this if i could not use it to make music.                
Now that i have used this amp for 3 months i can tell people a little bit about it.First,i own several amps so that should give my opinion a little credibility.This crown brings out the details so each instrument  can articulate it's exact sound right down to the minute details it really is that good across the 20hz-20khz spectrum.As far as power it is rated at khz rather than hz so don't be deceived thinking it has more power than it does.I have a amp that is rated at 1100 watts hz per channel at 4 ohms and it has a little more power than this crown rated at 1350 khz per channel at 4 ohms.That being said this amp has enough power to drive most speakers except big subs and a person would be hard pressed to find a amp that sounds this good in it's price point excellent job harman engineers.Also i want to give a big shout out to zz their play as you pay option is awsome takes away alot of stress when buying new gear,so thanks zz.                
I wanted to get an inexpensive, high-current amplifier and I needed it quickly for the Magneplanar MMGs I ordered for my birthday in April 2016. I've been driving the Maggies with the xli 800 through a vintage Rotel pre-amp and he music sounds fantastic. Even at 300 watts/ch into 4 ohms, the clipping lights would come on occasionally while playing Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd at moderately loud volumes. The cooling fans were in full mode after the song ended. Solid amp for the price. I highly recommend if you don't want to spend 1K and over for the exotics.                
I purchased this Crown Amp for my bands monitor system. I was a bit worried about this new line made in China.  The amp came and is well built, It sounds very clean , and a definite upgrade to our monitor system.  We have only used on a few gigs, but so far, so good.  Cant beat the price of 199.00 for zZounds my favorite music online store. The no interest pay as you play has allowed me to purchase a lot of badly needed gear over the last 4 years.  Keep up the good work zzounds !                
Sturdy, powerful and crisp amp. 
Wouldn't expect anything less from crown.                
I bought this mainly for the highs, been using it every week end, at first I was kind of doughtfull about this line or model (was more used to MACROS and MICROS from CROWN) as of now I haven't had any trouble with it, does not get hot, does not clip, now planning to get the 2500 for the mids ..........                
Having been a road engineer & house engineer at some of NY's best known venues, I can say without hesitation that even though I has somewhat skeptical
of the new gen. Cjinese-manufactured Crowns, the XLi series has performed remarkably well.
Excellent reproduction, major output (into 8ohm Polk speakers, cool running and all the sonic & functional protection needed.
Trying to hunt down a 60hz hum, I contacted Crown support. The tech spent 10 minutes talking to me. It was traced down to an old wiring system with a "sketchie" ground. Grounding the Crown to the pre solved the problem.

Bought this from zZounds about a year ago to power my bass guitar rig. Using an Eden preamp DI pedal, into this crown power amp, Bridged mode, 1100 watts @ 4 ohms, into my Ampeg SVT HLF 410. Also hooked up in stereo to see how it would power 2 svt cabs. Sounds great either way! This amp is a beast! Love this amp! Haven't had one problem with it. Can't beat the price either!                
I ordered this for my Bass rig. Once I hooked it up and played on it I knew I made the right decision. My rig shakes the house and the Highs shatters ears. If you are looking for pure power and in a small space this is the unit for you.                
Our church bought this amp to replace a old Peavey that had a noisy cooling fan that kicked in at all the wrong times.  This Crown amp is powerful, light weight and quiet.  what else could you want?                
First off I'm a budget-fi enthusiast not a professional sound guy and have built some great systems over the years. I've been away from the hobby for quite a few years as I was raising a family. I loved building stereo systems on the cheap then watching the color drain from friends faces as my second hand gear walks all over their system costing many times the price. Recently I decided to put a home theater in the basement with an emphasis on music. After reading many reviews I purchased a marantz sr6009 "refurbished" and a pair of JBL J7's "wow what a pair of speakers". I was extremely impressed with the sound from the marantz but I found it lacking in power. 110 "2015" Watts is not the same as 110 "1975" Watts for sure. The JBL's are rated at 450 Watts 6ohms, pretty hard to drive for the marantz. I decided I needed a high current amp to make em sing. I have been reading about class d amps for there efficient, low power, cool operation. I had a pair of Krell mono blocks that would run you out of the room with the heat they produced and would give you that sinking feeling like you left the iron on if you forgot to shut them down. My only concern was early reviews of class d amps being harsh and lifeless. After a lengthy search I stumbled upon the crown xls series amps and at the price point they are offered at I pulled the trigger and ordered a 1502. The Crown definitely gave the JBLs the juice they craved. The highs were great, the mids were great and the lows were tight, punchy and accurate. The amp delivers a very good sound stage, basically it gives you everything you had before just more of it. One thing it didn't do was add that little extra, that little extra that leaves you with a tear rolling down the cheek as you say "WOW" under you breath. So again to eBay I go, I then purchased a Yaqin tube buffer with a set of National Union 6sn7 tubes. All I can say is that I now live in the promised land, I let the tubes warm up and put in "Dark Side of the Moon" always the first. My first impression was jaw dropping. The highs, oh the highs! So airy and precise. The mids are like Irish butter, rich and smooth. The lows suffered a little from the tubes but was still great just not as tight. As for the sound stage .... Holly cow! Notes fly around my head like I'm in a tsunami of sound. This is the most holographic sound I have ever heard other than a tube amped full range speaker set up I had years ago, that system would throw sound behind you, listening at home alone, hearing footsteps behind you really freaks me out. My conclusion is that this is a great amp, especially if you have a finished basement and have limited power available. My power conditioner has a amp meter and has never passed 2 amps. It runs cool to the touch, the fan has never come on to my knowledge. What you put in to this amp is what you get out of it, but if you put some really great stuff in the Crown will reward you in spades. A well known audiophile wrote in a review that he now uses a Crown xls as his reference amp and after my experience I believe him. Now for another one to bi-amp the J7s, it never ends my friends once one has the bug. Oh, and yes the sound did leave me in tears of joy.                
I purchased this amp to drive a pair of CV XLS-12 cabinets. Wow, the amplifier performs flawlessly, is ultra clean, and has no heat issues. I love the built in features. I drive it hard, and it keeps the music going nonstop. Very pleased with the amplifier, solid quality from Crown! I would definitely purchase another one in the future if the need arises.                
This amp is by far superior for my needs. 3 weeks after  purchases I connected  this amp to my mid range 500 watts cubes and played at half way up for 4 hrs and it ran like a beast  and did not heat up or clip. Truly  recommend this amp                 
I'm running this amp mono on a Peavey 18" subwoofer and plan to add another one soon. It replaced a Behringer KM750 as it didn't have quite enough power (750 Watts Mono) and would clip just when it started sounding good. This amp does have more power for sure. It really rocks this sub. I'm sure when I add the second one and take it to 4 Ohms mono, it'll really pound.                 
Holey heck! I just upgraded from the XLS2002 model which is the model down from this one and OMG, this thing pumps so hard. Much harder than the 2002. I have it running two Peavey passive 18" subs into a 4 ohm mono load. It drives them until they can pump any harder. Never clips. AWESOME!!!                
This product is just what i needed to power side fill monitors. More than enough power @ 8ohms 2400 watts. I recommend this power amp, you wont be disappointed.                
Short answer: Buy the Crown XLS2502 Drive Core 2 amp!
Long answer:
Setup:
Receiver: Pioneer VSX-1101 (I am upgrading this to an Onkyo)
External power amp: Crown XLS2502 Drive Core 2
Speakers: (2) Cerwin Vega XLS-12, Cerwin Vega XLS-15S (powered sub), Cerwin Vega XLS 6C (center channel)
Assumption: Crown amp driving the floor standing Cerwin Vega XLS-12 (3 way, 12” floor standing speakers).  
I had bought the Cerwin Vega XLS-12 that was first driven by the Pioneer receiver alone.  It sounded good however at loud volumes, around 90 volume level on the receiver, it became very, very distorted.  Sounded awful and was very disappointment.  The speakers needed lots of power.  So after much research I settled for the Crown XLS2502.  WOW!
I honestly do not know how loud can my system can go now.  It is so clear at LOUD volume.  ZERO DISOTRAION at any volume level.  I had no idea that the speakers were that under powered by the receiver.  When you hear your speakers cracking with distortion they are under powered, not because it’s too loud.  
My system at low-medium volume level sound good, but when cracked up to 90 they sound great.  Lots of bass, extreme clear vocals from the mids and crisp highs from the tweeters.  The Crown amp and Cerwin Vega XLS-12 are the best purchase I have ever made.  My house is ready for a real party now.  Sorry neighbors my house rivals most clubs.                
I own 2 of these amps I run them in bridged mono 1400w per channel I use them to power (2) pair Cerwin Vega VS 12" 3-way Tower speakers. Behringer Mixer runs the show. I am very pleased with them extremely clean sound. I DON'T hear any rattling as mentioned in other reviews and the Bass def drops big time. Only thing that I don't like is the fan noise but the music at high levels i don't hear it. So doesn't bother me cooler amps stay the better so be it.                  
I actually had purchased this power amp and used it to power my bass guitar rig. I must say that it sounded FAB-O'-Licious!! (fabulous mixed with delicious) 8)
I use an SWR (vintage) Grand Prix preamp and the sound that comes out of my 410 and 115 sounds like a cross between SWR and Ampeg. It is a beautiful blend and couldn't ask for anything better!
Only problem is... 
it had mechanical vibration and rattling within the amp itself. Also, when the fan comes on, it is a little too loud and whines in high pitch.
These are the two issues that made me return it. I even tried putting an isolation pad between my rack and the 410 cab, but it only helped a smidgen. 
I also owned a Crown XLS1500 that was worse than this one!                
Love the DSP and all the features it has to make it sound the best it could be.
It doesn't have a speakon connection for bridging. You must re-wire one of your speakon cables going into your first cab. It's all on the Crown website.
You can also simply purchase a banana connector to speakon. I did this. Works great!                
The DSP software takes some learning and experimentation... but I seemed to catch on quick. Although I did call Crown for some insight. otherwise, it's very easy to use. You can simply connect and play and not bother with the DSP features if you so choose.                
The case is really nice and dark grey. Looked great in my rack! But it comes back to the innards and the issues described above.
If it weren't for the two issues I had listed, this would have been a keeper!                
There again, if it weren't for the two issues, this would be the best buy on the market in my opinion.                
They do try to help you with what ever they can over the phone, but when I called in to ask them about the two issues I ran into, they told me that they had put a lot of time into the testing of this amp and said there is no way that I could be having those issues. Because of their denial, I rate them a 9 out of 10.                 
FIXED!!                
Overall, a great sounding amp! Lots of power. Get rid of the mechanical rattle and replace the cooling fan with a quieter one and it would be a Keeper!!                
  Within 2 minutes of un packing I could feel that it was VERY POOR QUALITY. Just the feel in your hands and you know it's made in China. 
   The chassie is so thin & flimsy it's emberassing. Tapping it with your finger & it rattles like crazy. No way you can trust this on the road. The fan sounds like a jet engine and that was after playing bass for 60 seconds.
     The tone was good and I havn't tried any of the DSP modes yet.  I can't say the sound is good enough to overlook the awfull quality of construction.
    Also the banana jacks are terrible. Press in from the top? Believe me this is a corner that was cut by China. I don't believe Crown would design it this way. 
   I'm VERY upset with this purchase................                
This power amp is impressive and a must have for any DJ looking to push some real Bass sound to their system. It has different pre-set up features that are awesome and easy to understand. zZounds made it even easier with the fast and friendly service.                
I was a little skeptical of purchasing a set of these being that I could find any other reviews of them online.  I’m getting back into mobile DJing and they fit my budget and needs so I took a chance on them.
Both arrived in perfect condition.The DSP is easy to use and makes getting both speakers set to the same level very simple (no guesstimating that the bass or treble levels are the same).  I have yet to open them up to full volume as I’m still breaking them in, but what I have heard is incredible.  Bass can be punchy, or full sounding depending on dsp setting.  Crisp, clear highs and mids.  A really well balanced speaker.  
The handles are rubberized, so they’re easy to grip.  The polymer cabinets help save on weight, and don’t seem to scratch super easily.  The full grill is nice, and made of steel (stuck a magnet to it).  There is a screw to tighten the speaker to a stand, hidden behind the bottom handle.  The “Cerwin-Vega” logo on the front is a dull black color, not a bright silver like I thought it was going to be (which made me really happy thought I was going to have to paint it).
I’m waiting for my two CVE18S subs to come in, and once they do I’ll give a further review on both.  I’m really imspressed with everything I’ve seen from them so far and really looking forward to gigging with them.                  
I ordered two of these subs, and two of the matching CVE12 tops. Tops shipped immediately. Subs were on backorder and took a month to get the first one and im still waiting on the second. The one I do have sounds GREAT.DSP is pretty straight forward, handles are easy to grab onto, and its actually surprisingly lite for being an 18" sub. Im really looking forward to cranking these up at some upcoming gigs. No wobble or play in the top mole mount. Puts out nice rich, room filling bass, and gets a lot lower than other subs I've heard. Cant go wrong with these. Great pricing for entry level DJ's, or even seasoned event DJs like myself.One note, despite the extensive packaging, there is a small cracked spot on mine just below the grill. It doesnt have any play in it, and only appears to be a slight cosmetic defect. I dabbed it with a paint pen and you cant even tell it was there.                
Great sub had it for 6 months and still bumping strong.                 
The CVi-118S sounds just fine and definitely delivers what is needed to fill in the low end.  They may not have the punch or clarity of a much larger cabinet, but the reasonable cost and convenient size trumps what little may be lost by using a compact cabinet.                
Two each of both Speakon and 1/4" inputs, no worries hooking up to these subs in any situation.                
These CVi-118S subs are the perfect size for a small gigging band.  They are light and compact enough to carry around easily, and don't take up too much space in the back of the truck.  But at the same time they are rugged and heavy enough to pole mount my SP2s over them, I couldn't be happier!                
The CVi-118S subs are well built.  I've had these subs a few months now, looks like they're going to last a good long while. They still look new, no indication of wear yet.                
The CVi-118S subs are reasonably priced, and well worth it!   zZounds shipping cost was next to nothing, made the purchase an even better value.                 
I've had no reason to contact Cerwin Vega.  They've been around forever, I can't imagine there would be any problems if I did have to reach them.                
The Wow Factor would be how compact the cabinet is for a rugged, well built 18" sub.  Great looking subs too!                
Wish I had bought these years ago!  My old subs were literally twice the size and not much fun to move around.                
these subs are outstanding, lound thundering bass, exactly what i was looking for, i listen to a lot of musinc with heavy bass in it, what a great add to my existing system.                
Earth shaking, window cracking bass!
Do I need to say more?
I connected one of these to a Crown XLS 802 mono bridged, and the bass is so loud and punchy that my hole house shakes.                
1/4" input, 1/4" trough; Speakon input, Speakon trough, connections.                 
Plug in and done, not easy to move, it weight 80lbs.                
I gave it a nine because, there was sawdust and a small plastic bag that came out when testing.                  
Best sound and quality for your buck.                 
The red suspension material makes it look good in contract with the black cone and cabinet, looks good.                
Not my first experience with Cerwin Vega subs, I have them on my car stereo and that's why I decided to buy this one, and expect to last for a long time as the others have.                
I bought 2 of these and a Crown XLS 1000 amp. The amp is a lil under power but it will do the job untill i get another amp. I was frustrated that they didn't come with Specon Cables but i was able to find someone to make me a pair. I got them hooked up and tuned the amp to the setting i need and they THUMPED.. I had a guy from 2 blocks down tell me he could hear the bass in his house.. I was vary proud. The true test will come this weekend when i do my show but from where they sat in the middle of my garage, they sounded amazing. I would recomend these to anyone that is looking to upgrade or add to thier set up.                 
These are excellent for this price I am very happy with the low end these put out. Very happy I picked these. If you need some excellent subs and are on a budget these are it.                
As expected, this baby does the job. I bought 2 and wired them parallel and bridged my amp. Unbelieavable! I'm very pleased with my purchase and couldn't have done it without the Easy Pay.                 
Just recently had some friends over. Outside in yard the Subwoofer puts out a lot of bass. I love it. Will purchase another soon.                
These units have crisp and subtle mids with punchy and non-irritating lows (no brain rattle).  At louder volumes, highs are not overpowered by lows. These sound great across all music genres.                 
These are plug and play units. The best feature is they played right out of the box and and are still playing.                
Simple. Plug, Love Repeat                
Units are solid. Units need cover protectors for road use.                 
These are a little pricey for non-powered units, but are well worth the price.                 
I have not had the pleasure of working with customer support, which is a great feature.                
These look classy in appearance and do not overpower the eyes in high light venues, they blend well in low light settings and sound outstanding.                 
These are solid units overall. The sound is crisp on High and MId-range when used with a powered sub and no additional sound filter (EQs, Range expander, ect...). 
When played alone (amp only) they sound well rounded and full.                 
This sub is very well made and appears to be road worthy. It is very heavy as would be expected with anything housing two 18" subs.  It is a great looking speaker and I receive a lot of comments about its looks and sound.
It does not reproduce the very low notes but does pound with authority without over heating the drivers.  I have been using one and am planning on buying another one soon.                
Excellent sounding subs with big sound for the price. the twin 18" subs move a ton of air making the bass big and bold. it has bolts and mounting brackets already in place for 3" casters. the only draw back that I can say is it doesn't reproduce the super low bass notes that hip-hop, Rap and Dub step DJ's would like, but in large live sound settings, these are amazing with very tight Kicks and smooth Bass guitar rumbling through.                 
If your in a band, you might want to put your lips to a set of theses if your looking for new speakers, i have a line 6 floor pod, and run vocals too, they are really clear, i have to adjust my tone a little bit on the pod, other wise you you will a hum out of them, No big deal, i drive them with a 800 watt head,so i am not even geting close's  to the power rating,,I have had Cerwin Vega before and still do, for my 1000 watt stereo i think there about 25 years old, and still rock"n, and the twin 15 in these speakers WOW ,  All i can say is,, ck them out,, And by the way, there about a 100 # lb a piece ,, but they did put a handle on side of them, still , it would be nice if they put a wheel set on them, hint, hint, there a tank, BUT THEY ROCK,  P,S  THANK YOU  ZZOUNDS you guys are GREAT,                
I bought two of these for a party I had to go with my sub and to make my home stereo system kick-butt.
Mission Accomplished.
They definitely have the aesthetic factor as well, very clean and professional looking speakers. 
For being on the lower scale of high end speakers, these bad boys deliver.                
clean sound from Glen miller to Rush and Eminem sound great! power by nu6000dsp
Took a chance and bought these. There were no reviews and I’m not sure why. I push and push these things and they’re always crisp and clear. Great quality speakers!                
I've only had mine for 1 day. The moment I turned it on I felt and heard the difference. This single 18 might have more bang then 2 of my QSC KW 181's Thinking about selling my 2 QSC KW181's and buying 2 more of these. I have a big gig next week. Let's see how these hold up before I do that                
These subs are good but couldn't keep up with my QSC KW181's. The CV's would be better for indoor applications. I do more outdoor gigs and the QSC have a much longer reach and the CV's drop off drastically and if I try to have them keep up with the QSC they start clipping. I'm getting more QSC KW181's                 
These subs are really good and loud...they def go lower than the KW181 @ 100Hz crossover.I use them with a pair of RCF HD12-A in crossover mode.At very high volumes when i use just one, the limit light will come on as expected which is fine. Just don't let it stay on solid.blinking limit light every now and then is perfectly fine and i play that way all night...bass output is deep as the specs show. The reason some say the QSC go louder is because QSC are better at higher frequencies 50-120hz range and fall off below that.However the cerwin vega sounds deep because it goes lower in 35-80 range.Lower is what you want in a sub.When I use two, things are easier and no limit lights.....If you have a van or truck,go for the 21" CVX...sounds as deep as two dual 18"...i'm very impressed.The wheels make moving this sub easy....the tour grade finish is excellent and grill is solid.Cerwin Vega is back with this sub.Only downside is no delay settings like the RCF SUB 8003-AS II or newer JBL SRX                
I am so so glad I bought this subwoofer I use it in my 7.1 home theater set up and I mean this thing ROCKS ROCKS ROCKS. I am a BASS JUNKIE and this sub delivers                 
This sub carries the low notes nice and smooth.I paired it with the powered Yamaha 18 and the combo sounds amazing.Cant wait to get another one of each.I run them in my dj setup with two passive crewing vega 2 15 and horns.Kicks Ass!                
I have owned this sub for almost a year now and it is awesome! super clean sound all the way to the limit and this thing pounds. I have played all genres of music and it all sounds great.  while i havent done a side by side comparison i have heard kw181's before and the cvxl edges it out. the tour finish is super durable i dont have any scratches in it and it still looks and sounds brand new! i use this in my basement when im not playing shows and it sounds and feels like main stage festival level of bass. i am actually considering buying a smaller sub to use in my house as my neighbors are not big fans of the cvxl line of subs to say the least lol. it sounds super clean at low volume as well but the fact it goes so low 35hz means that even at low volumes my neighbors say the feel and hear stuff rattling softly in their houses. 
I can fit it in the back  of my toyota camry, but you will need to be pretty strong to do so as you cant really get any help fitting in the back seat. Im a big guy and can pick it up and walk with it but i try to avoid it as it is a beast. 
the castor wheels are awesome and i dont have any vibration problems. when i rented kw181's once the wheels vibrated and made an audible sound. i ended up stuffing paper towels in the gap and it fixed it. now that was rental equipment so that couldve been the reason but the wheels on the cvxl dont make any vibrations while its playing
the one thing i would change is the handles are oriented to pick it up when its laying flat. the handles are cutout nicely to lift it with two people but it doesnt fit through doorways unless its standing up vertically like when its resting on the wheels. i find myself rolling it along and having to pick it up vertically and set it back down and the handles are not facing the right way. this is only a minor detail and it isnt hard to move around especially if you have help. 
note there is about a 5 second delay when you flip the switch to when the unit is actually on. you will hear a very quite pop. make sure to wait til you hear the speaker turn on before switching on your mains if you are using the subwoofer outputs or your mains will pop pretty loudly. 
overall this speaker blew me away I have not regretted buying it for one second. If i ever decide to get a second sub I will definitely be getting another                 
This speakers will blow your mind if you know how to use them. They are great made, super resistant. I have 4 of this speakers an im really impressed what they can do. If you are thinking on buying speakers for indoor and outdoor. This is the deal. You can setup this speakers in a outside event, you will hear clear and loud sound miles away. No lie...
Cerwin-vega made exelent work                 
This is a true double 18 subwoofer its a room shaken window braken all the way to the back of any large event church, out door no matter what event the bass will be felt its a true concert sound sub its heavy of course but it will get the job done right i didnt have to trun it up but halfway for a room of 245 or less its a perfect match for my Yamaha dsr 115                 
If you are looking the perfect punch at a low price this is the deal. Cerwin-vega did a great job on the design and build of this awesome subwoofer. You will be impressed what this speakers can do. The punch will be heard and fill to the back row of your event.                 
Excelente subs really nice subs bought 4of these wooooow these sub are just awesome love the way they sound just amazing thank you zZounds.                 
I purchased this tool for a Church! It has single-handedly changed the dynamic of the worship experience, by adding depth to every aspect of sound reinforcement. Vocals are clearer, and instruments are distinct. This is engineering genius despite the size and weight. No Regrets With This Purchase.                
I have to say for the first review I have to say that this speaker Rocks just like the old school Earthquakes this Powered version is totally awesome.                
As a Veteran Recording Artist,I can say with confidence: "This Cerwin Vega EL-36DP subwoofer& competitor's alike,are a must in any and all Pro-Audio presentationsaka Live Sound Re-Enforcement.No subwoofer? No Life!A Live Show can live or die by the subwooferorthe lack thereof. If You're seriously invested in Live Sound? Look No Further. Moreover,if You're converting that basement or spare roominto a "true Cinema"? Don't mess around with subs for consumers Hi-Hi.Mess around with these instead! Their cost is in the same ballpark too. But, the sound is the real deal. 1 of these upfront & 1 of these in the rear, You're covered! No consumer brand subwoofer can compete with these"real" subwoofers. Just look at their construction? Can You imagine 2 of these in stereo upfront,one upfront for the .1 channel&2 in the rear for the IMAX style presentation. LOOKOUT!
Get this? Cerwin Vega also makes smaller professional subs as well, so we can buy multiples to achieve concert& IMAX sound without going broke.Have you ever compared the price for home theater subs vs thesepro subs? Let's be real ok? If You're converting the basement into a real Cinema? Then You gotta budget for Pro-Sound re-enforcement & addat least 1 of these pro-subs to Your sound system. You will not believe the difference in the "tactile sound"coming from Your new theater! I know for a fact, as a life long musician having workedinfront of & behind the recording consoles, "Professional PA Speaker will eliminate the competition! "Get this?Most basements converted to Home Theaters, already use individual,mono block amps, like we do in concerts and Commercial Cinemas. Example:Look on YouTube. You'll see Home Theater owners using Crown Amps to powertheir equipment while their subwoofers are left to try and keep upwith their builtin amps hence the title "Powered Subwoofer.
"Now Look?Any powered subwoofer trying to keep up with speakers powered bycommercial strength amplifiers are outgunned!If one is going to use real amps to power their other speakers,why wouldn't You buy subs like this + the ampsand do it right? The cost is the same. Might be even cheaper in the long run. In My 25 or more years of Music & Home Theaterexperience, I've learned that these commercial subspowered by, lets say, cheap crown amps, will blow the doorsoff the Theater and the consumer subwoofer competition. Don't get me wrong though.In a livingroom style Home Theater, these Commercial subsare overkill & this is where the consumer subs will conquer.Conclusion:1. Building a "real" Theater in a Basement or 20x20 ft spare room?Cerwin Vega EL-36DP subs or their passive counterpartswith external amps are the "proper" way to go.2. Using Your frontroom as the Home Theater calls forconsumer grade powered subwoofers.Well, that's it!Did I tire ya' out?~ peace                
Bought two of these subwoofers for my church after renting another brand to see if the addition of them to our sound would warrant the purchase. Rented ones sounded good so after listening to Peavy, Harbinger, and JBL at a well known chain store, I decided to try a long time known quality speaker maker without hearing them. zZounds has 30 day return, chain store no return. These speakers are great. I really like the quality construction and sound and the price was in our budget. Ordered them on Monday AM and got them the following Thursday PM at my door! running them on a Crown XLS1000 in crossover mode, able to hear and feel the bass guitar and kick drum. No problems so I haven't had to contact zZounds or Cerwin.                
Bought this on the 4 month payment plan.  Great buy.  This subwoofer has a really massive sound.                  
As a MUSICIAN 1st & HOME THEATER FAN 2nd ..
I owned B&W PA Speakers that looked alot alike these
but were light years better for Live Music reinforcement.
I could torture those at 118 db all night long!
Now, from what I am seeing here from current buyers,
these CV's are fragile to real PA use.
"But don't throw the baby out with the bath water!"
I believe the would be excellent, front L-R speakers
for the serious Home Theater, such as: .....
Basement Theaters
The Newly Designed "Box Theaters" (Not the cheap HTIB's)
or
the spare room turned into a Home Cinema.
I say this because,
these CV's are power houses for long throw needs.
3 of these for the front channels in a Home Theater
would be unbeatable!
You'd still want to supplement these with the CV 15"
passive subwoofer & power it with a 500 watt crown amp.
Then hang 4, high grade, 2 way, horn loaded, surround
speakers for the side and rear of the room.
This would be a TRUE Cinema sound system that will
make you forget you're at home.
My opinion, is these will never fail in Home Theater use
& will put that
"Oh Yeah!"
smile on your face when that 1st action scene
explodes on your big screen.
Providing you've got 10 feet between you & these speakers.
Their sensitivity means,
a 100 watt per channel surround sound AV Receiver
will power them up nicely.
This is the way I'd go, if, I were making a Home Theater
in my Large Spare Room, Basement or Garage.
Oh, they'd look threatening too!
The guys would be over constantly for beers
& an Action flick.
 ~ peace
Kinda disapointed tweeters were supposed to be self repairing but i now have to replace them for the 2nd time and now the mid/ woofers are sounding rough and i only use them for residential use should have went with something else for the $ i spent!!                
I've been a Cerwin Vega fan for 30 years and I do like the SL Series of home speakers and the SL-10S subwoofer. I have two hooked up to my home theater system. The 10 inch sub is well built and does hit a solid 28hz before it begins to roll off. In fact, depending on your room, you can get usable output an octave or so lower by patching into a DBX 120A Subharmonic Synthesizer. It sounds full, blends well with the SL line of speakers and I'm very happy and satisfied.                
I absolutely love the bass on these. Frequency response lower than almost any subwoofer. These are dual purpose for me. They are perfect for my Home theater and my weekend DJ gigs. These sound better than all my current PA equipment. If your an audio junkie like me the numbers don't lie. zZounds has made me a customer for LIFE!                
the last and most important speaker in putting together a 7.1 surround system. 4- 6 1/2 inch speakers  seemed nessesary to have a pair of 5 1/4 inch center channel speakers. Definately a great  sounding speaker. Only 16 1/2 wide, fits nice too.                
I use these for movies, TV and casual listening. They sound stellar at any volume. The dual 8" woofers produce serious low end and presence. I sent 95W to each of them and it was plenty. Hi end is smooth and clear. Mid range is well balanced.
The cabinets are average sized for tower speakers but they sound better than any other tower speakers I've heard (Sony, Infinity, RCA, etc.). They have a simple, clean design that just works. They are rock solid and heavy. They also look great with the grills off.
If you want massive sound in a medium foot print I highly recommend these speakers. They reminded me that when it comes to speakers woofer size makes all the difference. If you want serious sound on a budget you can't go wrong with these.                
I've gone through a few Yamaha 5.1 systems, a sound bar and a pair of Infinity floor standing speakers. These SL-28 speakers outperform all of them. Clear highs. Clean mid-range. Strong low end. I don't miss having a sub at all. I did a lot of research and am very happy with them. I use them for movies and gaming in stereo. They're powered with an older Yamaha RX-V775. I'm very picky and these satisfy.                
I made the right choice, these CVs are great, well made and sound like my 1975 CV towers!                
I bought these after trying out their larger brother the SL-28. While these have one 8" woofer instead of two they still hit hard and deep. It probably helps that I'm sending 95W to each of them. 
The high end is clear and smooth. Mid range is just fine; neither spectacular nor muffled. Low end is superb. Build quality is excellent. Appearance is clean and simple; the way I prefer. They look fun with the grills off too. They also shipped with rubber feet which I used on my wood floors.
After coming from a set of Infinity Primus these are a breath of fresh air. The low end is actually there and these have better clarity. All for less money and space. The good ol' fashioned recipe of a tweeter and a big woofer still works best.
I'd recommend these to anyone.                
I was having difficulty deciding between the XLS-12's or the XLS-15's.  Without being able to hear them prior to purchasing, the price of them at zZounds made up my mind. I couldn't pass up the price on the 12's!  I went with the blemished ones which were brand new, unused, but the original boxes were thrashed and the grilles had a dent...big whoop. The price was excellent!   Now for the sound of theses things; HOLY FRIGGIN COW!!!  These are absolutely amazing sound quality!  These topped off my XLS theater as they were the last piece. I already had the 6" center and the 15" sub, but was using some very old fronts from my teenage years. They were 15" 3-way Jensen's from the late 80's. They sounded great back in the day and actually still sound good but didn't have the clarity I was looking for in a theater setup.  Having the 15's prior is why I was having difficulty deciding which to buy.  These XLS-12's are CRYSTAL clear, will rattle anything off the walls and hit so hard that that that you would think a car ran into the side of your house!  They definitely need to be amplified to get the true potential, but even off a 90W per ch. reciever, they were still astounding!  Now they are amped at 150W RMS, which according to CV is still a little shy, but unless they are in an enormous room or a club, it is more than enough to make earth shattering sound and just amazing clarity!  One downfall to boosting the watts to them was I had to amplify my center channel as well, but now the center channel sounds even better than it did before. The center is the XLS-6C. Honestly, with these 12's, I don't even NEED the 15" XLS sub, but man what a sound!!!                
Short answer: Buy the Crown XLS2502 Drive Core 2 amp!
Long answer:
Setup:
Receiver: Pioneer VSX-1101 (I am upgrading this to an Onkyo)
External power amp: Crown XLS2502 Drive Core 2
Speakers: (2) Cerwin Vega XLS-12, Cerwin Vega XLS-15S (powered sub), Cerwin Vega XLS 6C (center channel)
Assumption: Crown amp driving the floor standing Cerwin Vega XLS-12 (3 way, 12” floor standing speakers).  
I had bought the Cerwin Vega XLS-12 that was first driven by the Pioneer receiver alone.  It sounded good however at loud volumes, around 90 volume level on the receiver, it became very, very distorted.  Sounded awful and was very disappointment.  The speakers needed lots of power.  So after much research I settled for the Crown XLS2502.  WOW!
I honestly do not know how loud can my system can go now.  It is so clear at LOUD volume.  ZERO DISOTRAION at any volume level.  I had no idea that the speakers were that under powered by the receiver.  When you hear your speakers cracking with distortion they are under powered, not because it’s too loud.  
My system at low-medium volume level sound good, but when cracked up to 90 they sound great.  Lots of bass, extreme clear vocals from the mids and crisp highs from the tweeters.  The Crown amp and Cerwin Vega XLS-12 are the best purchase I have ever made.  My house is ready for a real party now.  Sorry neighbors my house rivals most clubs.                
I had been procrastinating on purchasing these for a while, as it takes me some time to spend cash. I am sorry I waited so long, because WOW, these speakers are amazing. The sound quality is excellent, the build quality is excellent, and the price point for what you are getting is nice as well. Very solid construction! These speakers are large and heavy, but for a decent sized room, they are perfect. High, mid, and low response is wonderful. You can actually get away without needing a sub at all, however, I swear by one, so I am running a sub as well. I like to feel the music in my body when it plays, and these speakers do just that! I do feel these speakers could use a beefy amp to play constantly and plan to purchase one soon, but they are running very well on an average home-audio receiver without any issues at average volume levels. I would purchase these again in a heartbeat as I didn't know what I was missing until now. I highly recommend these to any home audio enthusiast looking for full-sized, loud, better-than-bookshelf speakers!                
I have 2 xls 12s and a xls 15s sub. And the rest of my 7.1 system is onyko wich includes a ht s592 recever wich is a beginner av receiver.  Holy crap this sounds so good it's crazy.  I m getting a better receiver  I don't need more power but I can't help myself.  Cerwin Vega is a phenomenal Speaker . You can't go wrong plus zZounds has the best customer service Ever. Wow factor is a 6                
The sonic quality of these speakers are superb for it's modest price tag and the low end response is excellent...but again,a substantial amount of wattage is needed to properly utilize their potential.                
As I had mentioned above,the "removable" grilles are a pretty useless feature(if you intend on re-attaching the grilles again.)As for what is useful,these speakers may function well in a studio(provided that they're properly amp'd...but they are a bit too large for most modestly sized rooms.General music listening and/or a home theater application,is the best use...it seems.                
It's easy to get good low end at lower volumes with these,but like I had said,these speakers are power-hungry.                
The XLS-12's appear to be very sturdy and of course,the metal speaker grilles are rock solid.As for the driver cones...well...I can't really gauge how sturdy those are,because I am unwilling to ruin the adhesive that has the grilles sealed in place,so I never took the grilles off to inspect the cones.They appear to be made of only paper pulp,which is a bit disappointing to me,(being that a lot of speakers these days,are made out of carbon fiber,Kevlar and glass aramid composite.)                
The Cerwin Vega's XLS line,are the only home audio speakers I know of,that have this unique 3 way design(with horn-shaped wave-guides for tweeters & mids) and bass driver cones that are larger than 8'.Personally,I don't care for the typical home theater tower speakers,because they are too thin & unstable,which is why I absolutely love CW's 12" and 15" designs!                
The company is fairly easy to get a hold of and they are eager to answer any questions that you have(although I do find some of their answers to be frivolous.)                
Though I am not particularly fond of the Cerwin Vega color scheme,I do love the overall design of the cabinet and it's front baffle.                
The XLS-12's,represent the ideal option...for those who don't want to waste an excessive amount of coin,for ultra high end bookshelf speakers and don't want to be bothered with a subwoofer either.The low end on these monsters are very apparent,even at low volumes...which is fantastic(which is good for apartments with volume restrictions.)However...if you want to bring this puppies to their fullest potential,a high wattage amp is essential(especially if you are going to run a surround configuration).I am currently running a 2.1,4 speaker set up and I have a 270W Sony amp...which is not nearly enough to power the XLS-12's properly.In the Cerwin Vega promo video,they advertise that the speaker grilles are removable,which is not entirely accurate.Meaning...that to say they are removable,implies that the speaker grilles have tabs on them that fit into some corresponding holes in the cabinet,but this is not the case.Actually...on the top and bottom ends of the grilles,are rubber strips,that are glued in place,so if you want to remove the grilles(you better be prepared to wrestle with the adhesive that holds the rubber strips in place and hope you don't tear the rubber into pieces..then...after which,you re-glue them,if you intend on re-attaching the grilles.I never did this myself,because I was afraid of damaging the speakers and I didn't want to create a mess.The geniuses at Cerwin Vega customer support,said that the reason the grilles are not easily removable like conventional speakers,is that they are "professional" speakers and yet,these speakers can be found under the HOME AUDIO category of their website.Come on people,the XLS series are CW's home audio line of products,not their pro PA line!                
Needed a replacement for my 12 yr old vega 710's. Bought some douchey polk audio towers from that "other" online retailer and promptly blew em in less than a week. Sent em back for a full refund and went back to Plan "A"..get some more Cerwin-Vegas. The waveguide kinda focuses the hi's,but these ROCK !!                
Yep it's a beast. Bought a brand new one to replace the one that came with my onyko.onyko makes a great receiver but there subs are junk. Anyway this sub will peel the paint off the wall two words quality and sound. Zzound is awesome. Will be buying more speakers from them.                
This sub did exactly what I hoped it would, deep base like you're at a live show.                
I had this same powered sub for 7 years. Bought it used for $300. Its a beast, its built rock solid and love the sound it produces. This made my home theatre system come alive, also made the walls and furniture rumble. Unfortunately, the controls started going bad after 7yrs which caused it to make a humming sound. Tried to fix it since i'm an electronics tech but couldn't find the correct potentiometers. I'd buy another if I could afford it tho.                
These sound great with many different types of music. The only thing I haven't tried is jazz and classical. But I do feel they would sound great.                
they can be biamped                
need a good amp not a best buy special or walmart junk                
build is very nice                
for the price you can't go wrong remember if you buy the 10,000$ speakers you still need a sub to make them sound like these!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                
They have a modern attractive look my wife even likes them!!!                
In the age of small dinky tower speakers on the market priced at insane levels it's nice to find a company that still builds them like"back in the day" !! WOW I really like these things!! Don't need a sub with these. Analog stereo at its best and better than before. If you've never hooked up a set of big speakers and listened to them get these and do it!!! After much research and counting pennies I made the decision to buy these and I'm not disappointed and neither will you. Sound is clear and undistorted. I will tell you that the highs don't scream at you and are well balanced. You definitly need a powerfull amp not a lame receiver. Separate components old school. There just isn't anything powerfull enough. Biamp and go!!!                
These speakers are off the hook. Low level volume with a good movie enhance the experience beyond that which words can describe.  Crank them up and prepare to thump your world. Clear, crisp and scary sounds will envelope you. But please be aware, these speakers are monsters and may, in my case, be a bit large for a room 10' X 12' .                 
I am very impressed with speakers. They are well built and love a high-powered receiver. The sound separation and clarity are extremely clean. These speakers are worth cent you spend on them. They are phenomenal!                
I was looking to upgrade my old Cerwin Vega 15" (HTS-15) Subwoofer and WOW what a huge difference.  This thing is amazing! It really hits those low frequencies quite well.  I want another one!  It is a bog box but you won't get these low frequencies out of a small box.                
Amazed by this sub. Very clean, packs a tight punch, and can bring the rumbling blow-the-house down bass as demanded. I was a little shocked at the price point at first, but after setting it up and driving it hard, I can't complain at all. Well worth the price in my opinion. I use this sub with a pair of CV XLS-12 cabinets for playing all types of music and video gaming, and the combination is wonderful. No complaints! Great product Cerwin Vega!!!                
Add to my stereo's sound output.  Delivers smooth tight bass.  Great buy to match my cerwin vega xls 215's                
it deliver quality and clean bass with no distortion what so ever. the bass is deep and strong. I use it mainly for movies and it performs beyond my expectation and music sound amazing. I only have one space now so am not sure how it does in other settings.                
the controls on the back makes it pretty easy for set up for music and movies. this sub is been driven by my onkyo ht r 593 receiver. it is jus sufficient in bringing all my movies and music alive                
it so easy to drive these sub. even though you need a receiver rated above or close to the peak power of this sub, 100 watts of power will surely make your home rock                
the design is built strong, big and compact. I believe it is intended to last forever. it is also heavy. the design blends with your home depending on your style.                
for the size and performance one can expect for this thing, the price is beyond believe.                
I have not dealt with the manufacturer. I don't need to as my product delivers beyond expectation.                
price is an object for me. and this sub is clearly the best for my needs at the price                 
this subwoofer delivers nothing short of theater quality. my family and I watch lots of movies and this sub makes you refuse to go to the movies. expect to be amazed.

Excellent subwoofer that does the job..                
Hey Look?
As a musician, I appreciate CV's
contribution to the world of Live Music Reinforcement.
But, that's right....but,
35hz isn't a very good boasting cycle for a subwoofer
said to be for the home theater enthusiast.
As a rule of thumb, a true Home Theater subwoofer
should operate down to 25hz minimum.
Moreover, the asking price for this CV sub is too high.
It's price per performance is wacky.
There's a USA based speaker Co. that specializes
in subs that routinely operate below 25hz for under $300.
So, I believe CV needs to rethink their pricing
and their product's performance.
At least concerning this model anyway.
I don't like giving a review like this because I truly
like CV speakers.
There's jsur NO WAY that CV should be asking
this much dough for this sub.

For them to sound their best, they need to be set up properly,  To sound their best in my room I have them about 3.5 ft from the side walls and about 2 ft from the back wall. They  have had large adjustable spikes installed,their backs are raised about 1 inch higher than the fronts to tilt them forward and are towed in so they are aimed directly at my listening chair. They also need high quality audio gear running them.Very few home receivers have nearly enough power to make them sound their best, so a quality amplifier with plenty of power is a must!                
They are not as critical about set up as many other speakers are.                
For their price, they are very well made. To keep the price low, they cut corners on the cosmetics but kept the build and parts quality quite high.                
I think they would be a great value at 2x their price. They easily compete with far pricier speakers.                
I have called CV a few times to ask for advise on set up and "tweaks" and have always spoken with friendly, knowledgeable, helpful reps.                
They make me want to get up and boogy to the music better than any other speakers I have owned                
Cerwin Vega was always considered a joke in the audiophile world because the old CV's had brash nasty sounding mids and highs. About 10-12 years ago they were redesigned with new mid ranges and tweeters. Now they have a nice balanced sound while keeping their great bass and their ability to play louder than many PA speakers! With high quality equipment the XLS-215's sound quite nice playing delicate jazz and classical music, and sound truly amazing playing rock, rap and movie sound tracks at unreal volumes. They easily blow away most speakers costing 2x-3x as much. I've owned many different audiophile speakers over the years, some retailing for as much as $18K. The CV's lack the some of the sound staging, finesse, or sweetness of many of them, but they have something that the audiophile speakers were all missing, They are fun to listen to! When I put on some great old Rock-n-Roll they demand to be cranked up really loud,and make me get out of my comfy chair and boogy !                 
I own 2 pairs of these so that should tell you that I really like these. For the money they cannot be beat in my opinion. Better have 2 people when delivered they are massive.I had to have mine delivered by a semi truck!! I also own higher priced speakers but these things do just a good of a job and do not be afraid to crank it up, they also are fuse protected. Quite simply put, they kick butt. I run 200 watts per channel stereo all thru tube amps with NOS tubes. Also if you do have a problem with one of the components which I have not they are so easy to service your self. Just pop out the component and replace a new one if needed . You can do it yourself. A very easy traditional design. Hands down a winner for me! Companies sell 10000 dollar plus speakers each which I cannot afford but you hear little of these. Really sad. In my opinion you cannot go wrong with these but better have the room !!!!! I hope the new company that bought out the maker of these do not start messing them up and keep offering these or if even possible improve on them even more.                
It is true that you can buy better sounding floor speakers, but you will likely pay much more for them. I owned a pair of the previous CLS-215 speakers and found them to sound good. Not super audiophile quality, but very good all things considered. I wanted 4 of them for a home theater 5.1 and 2+2 music setting. I ordered from other sellers only to have them come beat-up and damaged due to ground shipping. After waiting years I purchase four of the XLS-215 speakers from zZounds because they ship them freight and came shrink wrapped together on a pallet delivered with zero damage. Very Pleased. I don't like the big bad bass hype but do find that I rarely use my 18 inch JBL sub-woofers because these speakers provide enough bass for everything except the very lowest of frequencies.                
I would highly recommend them for all your music needs, great customer people and service. I will continue to use there business, for as long as I need music items. 100% Highly Recommend.                
I make my own custom set of bulk strings based on Billy Gibbons custom set... in fact mine is a little heavier. .08 first, .09 second, .12 third, .22 fourth, .30 fifth and .40 sixth. Now some of you might think this doesn't fit any mold, but it works for me with hot pickups. I have arthritis in my fingers and this gauge lets me bend like I was 21.                
These are by far, the best strings I've ever owned. They're perfect for dropped tuning. I play in dropped B and the strings still have the tension and feel of dropped D. There isn't any buzz when you slide your fingers up and down the neck either. I recommend these strings to any and everyone. Perfect for recording!                
N/A                
String winder with built in string trimmer -- great idea!                
The winder, which is plastic, attaches to the handle with a simple Phillips head wood screw.  Tighten the screw too far and the winder won't turn; too loose and you risk losing the screw and the winder wobbles.  The trimmer is a simple scissors cutter.  To get the wire slot open requires the handles to be moved rather far apart, which could be a problem for people with small hands.                
This is not a bad value for the money, especially since you get two tools in one convenient package.                
N/A                
This is a handy gadget.  It folds compactly and is easy to use.  Go to the hardware store and get some spare screws, just in case.                
I'll use this winder/trimmer until it breaks.  If it holds up well (it's new now), I'll get a second one for my other case.                
Wire cutter, bridge pin puller, string winder.                
I gave is a 8 cos of the bridge pin puller. i just bought this todae and i restrung my guitar and i used the pin puller, kinda hard tho. after i used i saw some dents on my guitar. dammit.                
simple design wif great looks and quality.                 
worth every cent                
this product is wad beginners need and wad pros should get                
yea, i love it.                
I have used a set of these strings on my Reverend Rumblefish PJ since I got it in 2003. That's right, the same set for the last 7 years. Everywhere I play people compliment me on the sound of my bass, and these strings are a big part of that: warm, punchy, perfect for the R&B, Soul, Classic Rock and Blues music I play.                
Perfectly polished.                
No problems installing, no problems since. Other players who've tried my bass say it plays like butter, and since my action isn't especially low (medium, really), it must be the strings.                
7 years and running says it all.                
Do the math - how much is a string that sings after all this time worth? More than you're paying here (it's also less expensive than most of the competition I rejected in 2003).                
I've never needed to contact D'Addario, I'm giving them a 10 for a product that didn't and doesn't need their support.                
I think this is a dam' sexy product, because I've seen the way it moves dancers...                
If I ever need to, I will replace my current set with another of the same. I'm beginning to think that's a big 'if'. But just in case, when I decided on this set, I bought a spare... D'addario isn't making money off of me, although they deserve to.                
The sound is phenomenal if you're looking for a warmer, less "twangy" sound.                 
Doesn't have accessories.                
Very easy to install and use. Had no problems whatsoever.                
D'Addario is the best. The scale was perfect. Never had any breaks or anything. These are also the choice strings if you are using a fretless bass or have concerns of marking up the bridge. I use them on a fretless Ibanez as well as 3 different Fender Precision models (Mexican, Japanese and American). Fantastic quality.                
The very best value. Period.                
Never had a need for support but the company is absolutely reliable.                
Best strings made today.                
I have various brands of strings (GHS Boomers, Fender roundwounds, Hatke, etc.) and these are, by far, the best quality and sound.                 
On my Squier VM Jazz bass I've been using Rotosound Jazz Bass 77 strings. They sound nice, but I wanted to try something else. I'm not sure why, but I did. So, I got these strings. The first thing I noticed is they are "brighter" sounding. I haven't learned the slap style of playing yet, and assumed round wound strings were the only choice for that, but I tried a little slapping. On the Rotosound strings, slapping the E and A strings sounded nice, but popping the D and G strings didn't seem to work. With these D'Addario strings, popping actually sounds good! Not as much bite as round wounds, but still very good sounding. Maybe I'll try to learn how to slap after all. The tension seems to be less than the Rotosounds, since I had to adjust the relief a couple of quarter turns to get rid of the fret buzz. I can't tell if that's good or bad, but it's not any more difficult to push on the frets. I can't tell if it's easier, though, it's been a couple of weeks since I played this bass, so I didn't do a comparison. I have another bass with round wounds, but it's taking a lot longer than I expected to play them without all those noises. I'm not giving up, but if I played in front of anyone, I'd use the bass with these flat wounds. Great sound, no squeeks, and barely audible (unwanted) harmonics. Even though my technique still needs work, these strings sound great! I'm almost wanting to put them on the other bass too!                
 They are just great sounding  strings.I play all types of music.I highly recommend  ECB81M  flatwounds.I am a professional bass player and,i have five bass guitars.They all have ECB81M flatwounds on them.What more can you say?                
Smoothe playability.                
Muffling the strings  gives a great  standup bass sound.                
Excellent  product.Never broke a string yet.                
Yes.                
I have had strings given to me. Yes they were.Yes. There was no problems.                
Excellent.Yes,This product  just sounds great                
As long as i am able to play.                
I have tried many different brands of strings and gauges and I do believe my search is over.
I really like the tone of these strings along with how easy they are to play.
No more trying to push down those heavy gauge stings.
I will be buying more of these very soon and I may even try out the  EJ15 Phosphor Bronze set in the Extra light gauge.
All I can say is these are my stings. And they are made in the USA                
Cosistantly the best for the 45 years I've been playing. I've tried DR and Martin neither has lasted or sounded crisp as long. I play country, 50's 60's 70's rock, bluegrass, and blues. Overall nothing has been as good. I play a CJ200 Epiphone acoustic electric,Washburn electric,and a semi-hollow Epiphone Casino.                 
Bright,defined,with plenty of sustain..but has a little more string tension
the tone tends to be brassy and lacks warmth
needs a better balance across all six strings
ok for brightening a cheaper acoustic but not what I would record with
perhaps the core to wrap ratio on the strings needs to be adjusted
a little stiffer to play                
all six strings don't balance well                
average value                
D'Addario is ok, but don't respond well to criticism of their products                
nice packaging,shiny strings don't deliver                
I will replace it very soon...can't stand the brassy tone and stiff feel                
Overall, these strings are fine for a beginner or a backup acoustic, but they are just too dull and lifeless if you are a gigging musician.  Keep a set on hand since they are cheap, but step up to the EXP line if you want a good sound.                
the sound is great. i take one mark off because they do a bit of a squeaking noise when you move your fingers.                
the coloured ends make sure that you dont mess up by putting them in the wrong spot.                
theyre made to last . its just that small squeaking sound that irritates me when you move your fingers.                
very much worth the money.                
daddario is my favourite line of strings.                
i have it already you.                
its mostly good.                
Apparently the last reviewer had a bone to pick with the company, because many pros will tell you these are the industry standard strings. I've tried many so-called 'boutique' strings and these are the most consistent in terms of clarity, longevity, and sustain.                 
Just bare-bones phosphor bronze strings.                
They sound good when you put them on, so they don't really require a break-in, but I prefer them after about an hour of playing time.                
As I said, these are the strings to which every other acoustic string is compared. They are high-quality.                
Getting harder to find deals on them, but they are competitively priced.                
N/A                
?                
I've been using them for years. I esperiment with others, but always come back to them.                
The sound of these strings is a very cheap one, they have no brightness or decent tone to them at all.  The strings have very little of that "new string" sound in the first place, and are gone withing minutes of the first note. Speaking of the first note, you will notice that it will not ring for very long, the string sound DOES NOT RESONATE. I've tried these strings in several settings, and none of them make these strings sound any better, this includes halls, and closed rooms as well as outdoors. The strings don't sound any better when recorded and sound terrible being played through an amp on an acoustic electric guitar.                
The strings require constant retuning, and will often fall out of tune mid song.                
Read what I had to say about the sound, you'll know what the quality is. Terrible.                
Do not buy these strings, do not even take them for free, they will only harm your guitars sound.                
I've yet to contact the company, but will soon about the poor quality of these strings.                
The string coating flakes, the strings rust quickly and are easily broken.                
The only decent strings I've bought from this company are EXP mediums for acoustic guitars, they are simply amazing, but these strings are an embarassment and I will never put them on my guitar again.                
These strings are just slightly ligher than what came with my Breedlove 
Passport. Daddario (always forget spelling) are great strings for the money. In sound they compare favorably with Elixers. Not sure if they last quite as long but I would rather have 2 sets of these than just one set of Elixers of the same guage!                
I like the color coded string ends. Really keeps you from making a critical error! They feel good and play well. I don't know what more you would want.                
As mentioned earlier they seem to compare with more expensive strings.                
Very well made and consistent. All are the same.                
Great price for great sound and performance!                
Just strings !                
I will continue to use these as they are always what you expect. Good quality,sound,and playability.                
brings out the smokey tone of a quality instrument, suppliments smokiness in less expensive guitars. Nice and bright. Record well. Lasting tone. Not as chimy as some 80/20 and others.                 
Multi-pack purchase price (eg. 4 packs for $20-$24.95) would be a welcome sight.                
Regardless of instrument(6 or 12 string), these model strings in any gauge turn more heads. Guitar just sounds more premo.                 
Have used these for 27 years, on stage, in studio. Have converted many players to their use.                
Put these EXP 60's on my old Ibanez ATK 300 and my Schector Stiletto elite 4 and just love the sound. Will go to a great deep bass growl sound or a real nice slap n pop. They last and hold up to a lot of hard playing and don't loose sound quality, but a set and I think you will like them.                
try them and you'll see                 
never any problems.                
yes                
never any cause or reason                
Do a sexy bass solo and you'll love the strings                
I have tried many other brand of strings and I will stay with me D'Addario's                
Does what is says - but towards the Treble side..                
I personally hate strings with too much of a metallic sound ... cough ... GHS strings. These strings simply have a nice tone to them.                
I really like these strings. I now use these or Ernie Ball strings. Pretty much, the one that is cheaper is the one that goes home with me. Overall, great strings.                
So glad DaDarrio makes these strings not many stringers make sets with wound g strings. Thanks                
The sound is absolutely devastating for metal, and very tonesy for cleans. With cleans it rings out very smoothly and thr harmonics fly at you when distortion is on! This is more of a metal player strings due to the guage size, unless you're a jazz player. The sound has a LOT of classic bass tone with some mids slashing it's way through. I've recorded with them, sounded great! Live, also sounded GREAT! I'm using these throug a Jackson JS30 Kelly and a Kramer 2010 Vanguard, (not the 300$ one, the 700$ one.) The only thing that could make this product better would be to make it free. ;)                
It has a colour coding system on the ball ends, to help you string quicker. The guages are perfectly chosen in this set.                
From standard tuning to B, the tension feels just great on these strings if you have a 25.5 inch scale or higher.                
Perfect quality strings. Sound lasts for quite a while.                
Yes it is, i've seen other strings for a few dollars more and have died quicker! These are a MUST own.                
Never needed support so these get a 10 as well!                
These strings are everything I stated above, so another 10!                
They are a little buzzy at some times (the low e string has some buzz in it on some notes), but when you jack your guitar into the amp the buzzing becomes silent so you don't need to worry about that.                
There is a ball end color chart for the strings so it takes the guess work out of installing them:
6th: Brass
5th: Red
4th: Black
3rd: Green
2nd: Purple
1st: Silver                
I guess ease of use for strings really depends on the guitar more than the strings. This was my first time installing strings on my guitar by myself so it was probably just me.
TIP: When you are tuning the guitar for the first time, after you get the string in tune Pull it up and then re tune. Continue until it doesn't fall out of tune.                
Pretty good strings. Easy to bend. Durable strings.                
I got them at my guitar store for $7.00
Zzounds had a better price but I couldn't wait for the shipping.                
N/A                
Before this I hadn't replace my strings in a couple of months, so I needed them bad...                
Overall these are decent strings. They work pretty well on my Ibanez. I will probably continue to get these strings whenever I need them.                 
Responsive with light touch and good for various styles of fingering                
The wound 3rd string holds true tone longer,more "gliss"                 
Thick enough to hold tonality and thin enough that finger pressure is minimal                
Round wound strings have brilliant tone they're good if you like glissening up/down the frets
Flatwound  strings could help someone starting out to play and have sensitive finger tips.
Transitions are easier.                
These strings with the wound third are great. They also make a 10-46 version. The 10-46 w the wound third are my all time favorite, I WISH ZZOUNDS WOULD CARRY THEM.                
The only reason I did not rate this a 10 is the less "bendability" of the third string, which is wrapped, unlike most other sets sold.                 
Wrapped third stays in tune.  It's what I have been looking for over 40 years.                
Hey, you pluck the strings.                
If you want to stay the G to sound balanced with the rest of the strings, use a wrapped third.                  
I have had my set on for a year of steady playing.                
Unknown.  Who would try to claim a warranty on a guitar string?                
D'addario strings have been the only brand I've used for at least the last five years.  I'll admit I used to enjoy Dean Markley Blue Steel, but you can't really expect to buy a case or seven and have them all be fresh a year later, D'addarios are always just as pristine as they day they were encased in their oxygen-free polymer mausoleums.                
D'addario likes to point out that their strings are 'Better by Design', and they are.  The hexagonal center literally bites into the wrap, melding the two metals like no other string manufacturer can.                
Always just as bright and corrosion-free as the day they were made.  The Dean Markleys just didn't compare.                
In short, buying any other brand in bulk is nothing more than a waste to me.  Buying single sets at a music store is far more expensive, and there's still no guarantee that your strings are fresh.  D'addarios, unlike other brands, will still be worth their price 2 years after purchase when you break a string 2 o'clock in the morning at your local venue.                
I've never had problems with any of my D'addario or Planet Waves products, hence service was never required.  This is a testament in itself, I'm still using the same Planet Waves guitar cables I bought about 5 years ago and they're still immaculate.                  
Nothing else meets the same engineering standards, nor does anything else sound the same (hey, all brands are different for beter or worse).                
Still going strong with D'addario and no plans to ever change brands.                
Crisp, neat, and clear. there's not too much else I can say about these strings, they are always consistent sounding from the time you thread them on, to the time you peel them off (I have personally only had less than a handful of them ever break while playing) the brightness and light clear sound these give is perfect for the high clear punch of single coils (IE A Strat or Telly) and yet they have just enough slink and "bite" (density/weight) to them to give a humbucker equipped guitar (IE A Les Paul or SG) a good thick bark. the only strings that I think sound better are the high end GHS Super Boomers (which if my memory serves, they dont make any more) but the cost split is rather pointless in my mind.                
The color coded ends are surely handy, especially if you are an instructor, teaching younger players how to change strings, it really helps them keep track of which string is which, and its great to double check yourself against making mistakes, no matter how long you've played.
As for the packaging; while a tad bothersome to handle and open, it so totally does the job it's built to do, which is keeping the strings fresh. I have bought other brands and let me tell you, unless your buying nylon strings, paper packaging is rather handy and a tad sexy looking, but it utterly fails at keeping the air off of strings and thus preventing corrosion, which will degrade the quality of your strings, no matter how much they cost.                
strings are strings right?
Ehh, not so much, Having played with D'Addario's for both my Electrics and my Acoustics, I can say that they make playing easier by promoting 3 things; 1: easy install (see above in Features) 2: easy break-in, and 3: easy playing.
Anyone who's played a stringed instrument knows that after you first get the strings on, you have a period of time where they are stretching a bit, and adjusting themselves and settling (the guitar also does some of this, but to a much lesser extent) and D'Addario's have the shortest break-in time of any brand I've ever used (and I've used almost all of them (acoustic and electric) in my 18+ years) so I gotta say, hands down, D'Addario does strings right.                
as titled, D'Addario's are pretty much the best bang for the buck value in strings you can get, no matter where you buy them, they are likely the lowest priced strings anywhere on the market, and the manufacturing quality is right up there with the most expensive brands (and in some areas, surpasses it)                
please, read above, now read this:
Buy this brand, no matter if its for you're acoustic or electric, because I'll clue you in on something wild; you can cross match them, meaning, you can swap on a set of electric strings onto your acoustic, and you'll get a super bright and clean jangle that sounds very interesting and punchy, and with acoustic strings on your electric, you'll have this fat dirty earthen growl that can not be replicated with effects, ever.
Let me say this again; BUY THIS BRAND!                
I've never had to use the support numbers or web sites listed on the packages, ever, which in a way, speaks volumes more that having to use it, right?                
just read everything I've written above and you'll have all the reasons you need to invest some coin in a whole 50lbs crate of these things.

I was absolutely blown away by the sound of these strings! The harmonics I am getting on my Strat are impeccable. sometimes I have to tilt my pick a bit because I getting too MANY harmonics, lol! If you play Rock and Roll or harder, these are for you.                 
Color coded is very nice. Packaging is nice as well. Just love these strings.                 
Like I said, the harmonics just pour out of these strings.                 
Even playing every day, these strings last for months. Amazing.                 
I would expect these to actually be higher priced for the product you get, but I am NOT complaining!                
Have no idea but I would imagine they are good.                 
they are sexy strings baby! lol                
DiAddario ROCKS!                 
I used to buy Fender Bullet strings until a friend recommended the D'addario strings. Just a perfect, brilliant sound and intonation, never cut my strings on stage again on years! The best guitarists in the world use it, something there must be...                
Just the best strings in a cute box.                
Years of study, and a good pair of trained ears!                
It's great, never had a complain with it.                
Almost the same price of another set of strings, but unparalleled quality.                
I never need it, but I think that must be great like all his products.                
Too sexy! If you wanna sounding like a real Rockstar, you need this strings... and a lot of practice... but that's another story.. :P                
When can't find it in my town, i bought the GK from MedinaArtigas and it sounds pretty cool too!                
The D'Addario strings are the best overall strings, the service I get at zZounds is unbelivable the best from strings to guitars to accessories, I've always shopped at zZounds and always will. Thanks again Larry                
They are very versatile. You can play anything from blues to speed metal with these strings.                
It's color coded and the pack keeps them nice forever.                
Easy to setup, color coded so you don't mess up.                
It is perfect! They last forever. Even when I live in a very humid place they last 6-10 months easy!                 
Great price. This product is great at a cheap price.                
I haven't had any need for it.                
Never buy anything but these.                
Great I will continue using these string forever...unless D'addrio makes something even more awesome(wouldn't surprise me).                
it make the sound very sharp,real and has a high mid range & that make the sound tends to be too screamy,thats amazing for a hard hyper rock solo but may be not too much great for jazz.                
the coloured balls the string's end make u never mess.                
well made,stay for a long time,300 hours of full speed at least                 
price is perfect,if u looked at the earny ball strings you will just find it 0.50 cent cheaper than the D'addario although d'addario is too much alot better than the earny ball.                
the strings are wounderful,have a very smooth touch but just one thing bothered me,the strings need to be more harder because they are so super lite.                
great sound and tonality for pop rock, pop. punk, rock, and harder rock. a very bright catchy sound.                
the coloured ball ends make sure you dont mess up.                
its made well cause it sounds well and lasts you.                
great price.                
i like daddario and i always will. they make great s**t                
im glad i already have it.                
its still good.                
The normal 6 strings do alright, though they're still far too light for my taste. But the bottom two, especially that outrageously floppy F# - it's no wonder people complain about the muddiness of extended-range guitars! It's 90% the strings' fault.
I recently ordered my own custom set of D'Addario Singles (9.5, 13, 17, 24, 32, 44, 60, 80) and they made all the difference the world to my tone and to the strings' playability. The high strings are still fairly light, but get progressively heavier towards the bottom, which is what the pickups need in order to give out crisp tones.
I love D'Addario strings, but this SET of strings is a dud. If you're not quite as picky as I am, at least order separate B and F# strings with heavier gauges so they don't sound like mud and give us 8-stringers a bad rep.                
Great for fast picking. Got some on my Epiphone SG Pro. With the SG fast neck these strings make playing even faster.                
The sound is great , The guitar stays in tune for longer than ever.                 
It has coloured balls at the end of the strings which makes everything easier.                
Truly the best strings I've ever played with.                
Very good price for that quality.                
Come on it's string what customer service do you need ?                 
Overall the best strings to play heavy music but also good for music such as Blues or Jazz.                
I like particularly the sound of the wound strings. Their balance with the plain strings just seems to me to be better and more even. The quality of manufacturing is second to none, they feel great, and maybe most importantly they last longer than most others, as well as they are easier to keep in tune. Nix to GHS strings on that one. I couldn't keep them in tune at all on my strat. Hope this helps.                
With these strings I can get any sound I want out any of my electrics.                
The best made string I have found yet that doesn't cost too much.                
Exceptional price very this kind of quality.                
Very professional and courteous.                
I will stay with D'Addario as long as I can play guitar.                 
This string set should have been named "Light Top, Super-Heavy Middle, and Floppy Bottom." That pretty much sums up my review. They're great strings obviously, but the gauges don't make a good set.
I did some calculations, ordered my own custom set of D'Addario singles (9.5, 13, 17, 24, 32, 44, 60, 80) and voila! The muddiness on the low F# and B strings evaporated (it wasn't the pickups' fault after all), the middle strings became bendable again, and string-tension is pretty even across the fretboard which is SO much more playable.
Buy D'Addario all the way, but don't buy this set if you don't want serious tension and tone problems. 8-string guitarists need to be especially picky with strings, and this set was not intelligently assembled.                
Sick ass man!!! These mofo strings are pretty zesty. Went dull but I was still able to get the trebble I need for technical death metal.                
Worked well just wish they'd last longer.                
Basically worth it I wish the longevity would be better.                
These are my new favorites                
Bought these for my esp ltd b55 which is a 34" scale. The D string transitions into the smaller winding that is supposed to be up near the tuner, right in the middle of the first fret. So it vibrates in the nut. Other than that they are good strings.                
Back around '02 when I started performing 3+ hr solo acoustic shows, I started noticing how my sound would get stagnant about an hr into the set. I tend to use big sounding guitars and they were sounding like wet logs by the end of the sets. So, I ordered a dozen or so different strings and tried them all out for a few days each, then took the best of those and performed with them. 
These EXP11s weren't the best sounding of the bunch, but they still sounded good and most importantly, the tone was consistent throughout the night. My hands weren't torn up either since the coating on them didn't tear into my fingers like non-coated strings will when playing that long of a set (I rarely take breaks). 
So, are they the BEST sounding strings? No, but they'll sound good and stay true to their tone for an extended period. I'd think that's a plus for people who don't want to mess with changing strings often. Oh, and after all of that research, I found out these are the same strings Dave Matthews and many other acoustic performers use and for good reason!                  
I prefer these strings over Cleartones, and perhaps over Elixir Nanowebs.  The sound is plenty strong and rich. Each guitar is different, and strings sound different on different guitars.  The trick is to match the strings to the individual instrument.                
They do what they're supposed to do -- protect the string from oils, etc., and keep them in tune and sounding good longer.                
Well, they're strings, so ya pretty much put 'em on.  I HAVE noticed that they stay in tune very well once they've been tuned a time or two, and that they dont stretch out for as long as some other strings will.                
Very good results, no strings breaking without cause or wearing out prematurely.                
Best price on treated strings.  Elixirs are a bit more (and sometimes a bit more slick and dull).  Cleartones are out of touch with reality, and I don't care for them all that well.                
These guys are top notch.  When I phoned with question, they didn't act all put out that I was bothering them.                
I prefer them on certain acoustics.  If they weren't available, I'd go to Elixirs.                
So long as they keep sounding good on my guitars, I'll keep using them.                
these strings are soft and flat. they stink.                
nothing good to say here.                
no matter how I tune or what guitar I put them on they are dull.                
they do feel good untill you try to play them.                
you can't give me these strings.                
I use the 26 lights and they are one of my favorites.                
no thanks.                
these strings should be taken off the market. they are giving a good company a bad name.                
The sound of these guitar strings is incredible, from the first tuning they sound like perfectly broken in strings. I've bought these strings two times now (It's all I've needed in a 5 month period) and the strings did not so much as slip a half of a step when I first tuned them. I tend to play every genre, just with my own twist on it, and belive me when I say that these strings sound great with every one of them. I've played these strings on a Yamaha Acoustic (Not the greatest guitar in the world) and a Fender acoustic-electric. Both of the guitars sounded amazing, and you would belive by sound that the Yamaha (250 dollars approx) was a 500 dollar guitar due to these strings. These strings also allow me to get creative in ways that many other brands wont, I am now able to play anywhere on the fretboard with no buzz or fading in the sound. Power chords, standard, Barre, and finger picking all sound beautiful on these strings. I'd also like to mention that I've used these strings in both live and recording sessions, and they have yet to fail me in any sense.                
The extra coating on the strings is more than any guitarist could ask for, these string truely do last 3 or 4 times longer than the average string, even if you're the type that tunes and retunes (Eb or D tuning ect) constantly, the strings will not let you down.                
The quality of the strings are extreemly high, as I stated before they have never slipped on me after first tuning. A capo will not cause need for re-tuning on these strings and they're very easy to put on your guitar, clearly labled and packaged.                
The strings are a bit pricey, BUT you must realize that they pay for themselves around the 1st month you've had them. Because you don't have to change the strings, you're saving money.                
I did have one instance of a string snapping, and despite it being a month after the purchase, the company gladly sent me a replacement set.                
These strings will not easily rust, they never show dirt or grime and never flake.                
I feel confident in using these strings on ANY of my future guitars, and they do make me have a bit more faith in the company.                
Owning thee mandolins, one over 100 years old, I have tried a lot of strings to get the best sound from each.
